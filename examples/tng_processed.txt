captain kirk how does it feel to be back on the enterprise bridge can i ask you a few questions wed like to know how you feel how youre going
excuse me excuse me excuse me there will be plenty of time for questions later im captain john harriman and id like to welcome you all aboard
its our pleasure
i just want you to know how excited we all are to have a group of living legends with us on our maiden voyage i remember reading about your missions when i was in grade school
oh really well may we have a look around
please please
demora
captain this is the first starship enterprise in thirty years without james t kirk in command how do you feel about that sir
oh just fine im glad to be here to send her on her way
and what have you been doing since you retired
keeping busy
captain kirk
why dont we give the captain a chance to look around

captain  excuse me id like you to meet the helmsman of the enterpriseb demora ensign demora sulu
its a pleasure to meet you sir my fathers told me some interesting stories about you
your father is hikaru sulu
yes sir
oh youve met her before when she was
it wasnt so long ago it couldnt have been more than
twelve years sir
twelve years
absolutely
incredible congratulations ensign it wouldnt be the enterprise without a sulu at the helm
thank you sir
im sure hikaru must be very proud of you
i hope so
i was never that young
no you were younger
damn fine ship if you ask me
scotty it absolutely amazes me
what would that be sir
sulu when did he find the time to have family
well like you always say if somethings important youll make the time

ah so thats why you seem so restless finding retirement a little lonely are we
you know im glad youre an engineer with a tact like that youd make a lousy psychiatrist
ha ha ha
excuse me gentlemen if youll take your seats
yes of course

prepare to leave spacedock aft thrusters ahead onequarter port and starboard at station keeping captain kirk id be honoured if youd give the order to get underway
thank you very much i
please sir
no
please i insist
take us out

very good sir
brought a tear to my eye
oh be quiet

gentlemen gentlemen tell me now that youve seen the rest of the ship hows it feel to be back
fine fine fine
ladies and gentlemen weve just cleared the asteroid belt our course today will take us out past pluto and then back to spacedock just a quick run around the block
captain will there be time to conduct any tests on the warp drive system
were picking up a distress call captain
on on speakers
this is the transport ship lakul were caught in some kind of energy distortion two ships in our convoy were trapped in a severe gravimetric distortion we cant break free we need immediate help it tearing us apart this is the trans
the lakul is one of two ships transporting elaurian refugees to earth
ensign sulu can you locate them
the ships are bearing at three one zero mark two one five distance three light years
signal the closest starship were in no condition to mount a rescue we dont even have a full crew aboard
were the only one in range sir
well then i guess its up to us helm lay in an intercept course and engage at maximum warp
aye sir
 captain is there something wrong with your chair
were within visual range of the energy distortion captain
on screen
what the hell is that
ive located the transport ships their hulls are starting to buckle under the stress they wont survive much longer
were encountering severe gravimetric distortions from the energy ribbon captain
well have to keep our distance we dont want to get pulled in too
tractor beam tractor beam
we dont have a tractor beam
you left spacedock without a tractor beam
it wont be installed until tuesday ensign sulu try generating a subspace field around the ships that might break them free
theres too much quantum interference captain
what about what about venting plasma from the warp nacelles that might disrupt the ribbons hold on the ships
aye sir releasing driveplasma its not having any effect sir i think the ribbons hold
sir the starboard vessels hull is collapsing
how many people were aboard that ship
two hundred sixtyfive
sir the lakuls hull integrity is down to twelve percent
captain kirk i would appreciate any suggestions you might have
first move us within transporter range and beam those people aboard the enterprise
what about the gravimetric distortions theyll tear us apart
risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair
helm close to within transporter range
and second turn that damned thing off

were within range sir
beam them directly to sickbay
aye sir
how big is your medical staff
the medical staff doesnt arrive til tuesday
  you and you and you youve just become nurses lets go
main engineering reports fluctuations in the warp plasma relays
sir im having trouble locking onto them they appear to be in some sort of temporal flux
scotty
what the hell
their life signs are are phasing in and out of our spacetime continuum
phasing to where
sir their hulls collapsing
beam them out of there scotty
transport complete i got fortyseven out of one hundred fifty

report
were caught in a gravimetric field emanating from the trailing edge of the ribbon
all engines full reverse

youre going to be all right we are going to help you we are going to help you
its okay everything is fine
why why
its all right youre safe youre on the enterprise
no no i have to go i have to go back
you have to stay right here
you dont understand let me go back let me go back let me go back let me go back please

what was he talking about
i have no idea
can i help you
its going to be okay
youll be all right you just need to rest come over here

theres just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude
hull integrity at eightytwo percent
but i do have a theory
i thought you might
an antimatter discharge directly ahead might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away
photon torpedo
aye sir
were losing main power
load torpedo bays prepare to fire on my command
captain we dont have any torpedoes
dont tell me tuesday
hull integrity at forty percent
captain it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish
where are the deflector relays
deck fifteen section twentyone alpha
ill go you have the bridge
wait your place is on the bridge of your ship ill take care of it
scotty keep things together until i get back
i always do
lieutenant fortyfive seconds to structural collapse
bridge to captain kirk

kirk here
i dont know how much longer i can hold her together
thats it lets go

activate main deflector
were breaking free

its all right im increasing power to compensate were clear
you did it kirk damage report ensign
theres some buckling on the starboard nacelle and weve also got a hull breach in engineering section emergency forcefields in place and holding
where
sections twenty through twentyeight on decks thirteen fourteen and fifteen
bridge to captain kirk captain kirk please respond have chekov meet me on deck fifteen

my god was anyone in there
aye
 years later


bring out the prisoner
mister worf i always knew this day would come are you prepared to face the charges
answer him
i am prepared
we the officers and crew of the uss enterprise being of sound mind and judgment hereby make the following charges against lieutenant worf one that he did knowingly and wilfully perform above and beyond the call of duty on countless occasions two most seriously that he has earned the admiration and respect of the entire crew
mister worf i hereby promote you to the rank of lieutenant commander with all the rights and privileges thereto and may god have mercy on your soul

hip hip
hooray
hip hip
hooray
hip hip
hooray
congratulations mister worf
thank you sir
extend the plank
into the sea with him feed him to the sharks walk the plank etc
lower the badge of office

hell never make it no one ever has

if theres one thing ive learnt over the years is never to underestimate a klingon

remove the plank

number one thats retract the plank not remove the plank
of course sir sorry
aarrgh aarrgh
doctor i must confess i am uncertain as to why someone falling into freezing water is amusing
oh its all done in good fun data
fun
fun
i do not understand
youve got to get into the spirit of things learn to be spontaneous live in the moment do something unexpected get it
got it

oh oh
data that was not funny
all hands make sail tgansuls and courses stand by the braces
will just imagine what it was like no engines no computers just the wind and the sea and the stars to guide you
bad food brutal discipline no women
bridge to captain picard
picard here
theres a personal message for you from earth
put it through down here the best thing about a life at sea was that no one could reach you this was freedom will
computer arch
look alive there

here take the wheel captain are you all right
yes im fine excuse me
computer exit
mister la forge set the royals and stunsails
whats a stunsail sir
you see the last yardarm just above that
bridge to holodeck three
riker here
were picking up a distress call from the amargosa observatory sir they say theyre under attack
red alert all hands to battle stations captain picard to the bridge


it looks like were too late
there are no other ships in the system
captain we are approaching amargosa it looks like the observatory took quite a beating
survivors
sensors show five life signs aboard the station captain
the station complement was nineteen
stand down from red alert number one will you begin an investigation ill be in my ready room
sir
make it so just do it
mister worf
aye sir

mister worf youre with me
these blast patterns are consistent with a typethree disruptor
great that narrows it to romulan breen and klingon
over here
its all right do not struggle
its okay were right here ive got you im commander william riker from the starship enterprise
soran doctor tolian soran
who attacked you doctor
i dont know it all happened so fast
commander youd better take a look at this
romulans

data whatever possessed you to push her in the water in the first place
i was attempting to get into the spirit of things i thought it would be amusing spot is she still angry
id stay out of sickbay for a couple of days if i were you

data youre not actually thinking about using that thing are you
i have considered it for many months in the light of my recent episode with doctor crusher now would be the appropriate time
i thought you were worried it would overload your neural net
that is true however i believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse for thirtyfour years i have endeavoured to become more human to grow beyond my original programming still i am still unable to grasp such a basic concept as humour this emotion chip may be the only answer geordi
all right listen at the first sign of trouble im going to deactivate it agreed
agreed

we found two dead romulans on the station were analysing their equipment to see if we can determine what ship theyre from
theres still no indication of why they attacked the station
they practically tore the place apart accessed the central computer turned the cargo bay inside out obviously they were looking for something
this could signify a new romulan threat in this sector inform starfleet command
you want me to contact starfleet
is there a problem
no sir there was something else captain one of the scientists a doctor soran insisted on speaking with you i told him you were very busy but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away
understood thatll be all
sir is there anything wr
no thank you

gentlemen something new from forcas three

what
i believe this beverage has provoked an emotional response
really what do you feel
i am uncertain because i have had little experience with emotion i am unable to articulate the sensation
emotion
ill explain later
ouf
it looks like he hates it
yes that is it i hate this
data i think the chip is working
yes i hate this it is revolting
more
please
im looking for a doctor soran from the observatory doctor soran
yes ah yes captain thank you for coming
i understand theres something urgent you wish to discuss with me
yes i must return to the observatory immediately i must continue a critical experiment ive been running on the amargosa star
were still conducting our investigation into the attack as soon as that is complete then i will allow you and your colleagues to return but until then there is nothing i can do
timing is very important in my experiments if it is not completed in the next twelve hours years of research will be lost
were doing the best we can if youll excuse me
they say time is the fire in which we burn right now captain my time is running out we leave so many things unfinished in our lives i know you understand
ill see what i can do


we have analysed the romulan tricorders they were scanning for a signature particle of a compound called trilithium
trilithium
yes an experimental compound the romulans have been working on trilithium is a nuclear inhibitor in theory it could stop all fusion within a star however the romulans never found a way to stabilise it
why would they look for it on a federation observatory it doesnt make sense
i do not know
have geordi and data go over with the next away team tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium
aye sir

well theres no sign of any trilithium over here
ha ha ha i get it ha ha ha i get it
you get what
when you said to commander riker the clown can stay ha ha ha but the ferengi in the gorilla suit has to go ha ha ha
what are you talking about
during the farpoint mission we were on the bridge and you told the joke that was the punch line ha ha ha
farpoint data that was seven years ago
i know i just got it ha ha ha ha ha very funny ha ha ha
wait a minute theres a door hidden right behind here i can see the separation with my visor
there appears to be a dampening field in operation i cannot scan beyond the bulkhead
there doesnt seem to be a control panel or an access port
it appears to be magnetically sealed i believe i can reverse the polarity by attenuating my axial servo open sesame you could say i have a magnetic personality ha ha ha humour i love it
data come take a look at this will you have you ever seen a solar probe with this kind of configuration

no geordi i have not have you no i have not it is most unusual ha ha ha mister tricorder ha ha ha
just see if you can help me get these panels open
make it so
whoa my visors picking up something in the theta band it could be a trilithium signature

data we dont have time for this
i cannot help myself i think that something is wrong

data data are you all right
i believe the emotion chip has overloaded my positronic relay
we better get you back to the ship la forge to enterprise la forge to enterprise
gentlemen is there a problem
doctor soran yeah there appears to be some sort of damping field in here its blocking our com signal can you turn it off
of course id be only too happy to

please please do not hurt me please

yes come yes counselor is there something i can do for you
ive come to see if theres anything i can do for you
oh its just family matters you never met my brother and his wife did you

no
robert so opinionated so pompous and arrogant he always had to have the last word but he mellowed a little bit in the last few years i was going to get together with them all next month on earth i thought wed go to san francisco rens always wanted to see starfleet academy
ren oh your nephew
hes so unlike his father hes a dreamer imaginative very gentle
whats happened
robert and ren theyre burned to death in a fire
im sorry
thats all right counselor these things happen
captain its not all right
i cant help keep thinking about about all the experiences that ren is not going to have not going to academy reading books and listening to music falling in love building a life well its not going to happen now
i didnt realise he meant so much to you
id come to feel that ren was as close as i would get to having a child of my own
your family history is very important to you isnt it
right oh from being a small child i can remember being told about the family line the picard who fought at trafalgar the picard who won the nobel prize for chemistry the picards who settled the first martian colony when robert married and had a son i
you felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line
right yes thats it exactly you know counselor recently ive become very much aware that there are fewer days ahead than there are behind but i took comfort from the fact that the family would go on but now therell be no more picards


report
a quantum implosion has occurred within the amargosa star all nuclear fusion is breaking down
how is that possible
sensor records show that the observatory launched a solar probe into the sun a few moments ago
the star is going to collapse in a matter of minutes
sir the implosion has produced a level twelve shock wave
thatll destroy everything in this system
transporter room to bridge i cant locate commander la forge or mister data sir
have they come back to the ship
no sir they are not on board
how long before the shock wave hits the observatory
four minutes forty seconds
number one
mister worf
aye sir

soran transmit your coordinates

what the hells he doing
enterprise to commander riker you have two minutes left
did you hear that soran weve got a level twelve shock wave coming in weve got to get out of here

sir a klingon birdofprey is decloaking off the port bow
what


data see if you can get to geordi
i  i cannot sir
prepare for transport


commander rikers team is aboard sir
helm warp one engage

youve done it soran

wait i hope for your sake you were initiating a mating ritual
you got careless the romulans came looking for their missing trilithium
impossible we left no survivors on their outpost
they knew it was on the observatory if the enterprise hadnt intervened they would have found it
they didnt find it and now we have a weapon of unlimited power
no lursa i have the weapon and if you ever want me to give it to you i would advise you to be a little more careful in the future
perhaps we are tired of waiting
without my research the trilithium is worthless as are your plans to reconquer the klingon empire set course for the veridian system maximum warp
boshtajah veridian 

hes an elaurian over three hundred years old he lost his entire family when the borg destroyed his world soran escaped with a handful of other refugees aboard a ship called the lakul that ship was later destroyed by some kind of energy ribbon but soran and fortysix others were rescued by the enterpriseb
that was the mission where james kirk was killed
i checked the passenger manifest of the lakul guess who else was on board

soran is a name i havent heard in a long time
you remember him
yes
guinan it is very important that you tell me everything that you know we think that soran has developed a weapon a terrible weapon one that might even give him enough power to destroy
soran doesnt care about weapons or power he just cares about getting back to the nexus
whats the nexus
the energy ribbon that destroyed that ship was just not some random phenomenon travelling through the universe its a doorway to another place that we call the nexus its a place that ive tried very very hard to forget
what happened to you
it was like being inside joy as if joy was something tangible and you could wrap yourself in it like a blanket and never in my entire life have i been as content
and then you were beamed away from there
pulled ripped away none of us wanted to go i would have done anything anything to get back there but once i realised that wasnt possible i learned to live without that
what about soran
if hes still obsessed he could be a very very dangerous man
why would he destroy a star thank you guinan
if you go youre not going to care about anything not this ship soran nothing all youll want is to stay in the nexus and youre not going to want to come back


marvellous technology this is a remarkable piece of equipment
im glad you approve
not very stylish though is it have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more how can i say more normal
whats normal
whats normal well thats a good question normal is what everyone else is and you are not
why dont we just get down to it what do you want
as you may or may not be aware i am an elaurian some people call us a race of listeners we listen right now mister la forge you have my complete attention i want to listen to everything you know about trilithium
captains log stardate  doctor crusher has informed me that datas emotion chip has been fused into his neural net and cannot be removed however she believes he is fit for duty so i have asked him to join me in stellar cartography

according to our information the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through this galaxy every thirtynine point one years it will pass through this sector in approximately fortytwo hours
yes guinan was right she said that soran was trying to get back to the ribbon now if thats true there has to be some connection with the amargosa star data give me a list of anything that was affected by the stars destruction no matter how insignificant
data
sorry sir it will take the computer a few moments to compile the information
data are you all right
no sir i am finding it difficult to concentrate i believe i am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse regret concerning my actions on the observatory
what do you mean
i wanted to save geordi but i experienced something i could not expect fear i was afraid according to our current information the destruction of the amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector gamma emissions have increased by point zero five percent the starship bozeman was forced to make a course correction ambient magnetic fields
wait the bozeman why would it make a course correction
the destruction of the amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout this sector as a result any ship passing through this region would have to make a minor course correction
a minor course correction wheres the ribbon now
this is its current position
can you project its course
captain i cannot continue with this investigation i wish to be deactivated until doctor crusher can remove the emotion chip
are you having some kind of malfunction
no sir i simply do not have the ability to control these emotions
data i have nothing but sympathy for what you are feeling but right now i need you to
sir i no longer want these emotions deactivating me is the only viable solution
part of having feelings is learning to integrate them into your life data learning to live with them no matter what the circumstances
no i cannot
you will not be deactivated youre an officer on board this ship and i require you to perform your duty that is an order commander
yes sir i will try sir
sometimes it takes courage to try data courage can be an emotion too now can you project the course of the ribbon
i believe so
enhance grid ninea where was the amargosa star now you said when the amargosa star was destroyed it affected the gravitational forces in this sector did the computer take that into account when it projected the course of the ribbon
no sir i will make the appropriate adjustments
thats what sorans doing hes changing the course of the ribbon but why why would he try to change its path why doesnt he just fly into it with a ship
our records show that every ship which has approached the ribbon has either been destroyed or severely damaged
he cant get to the ribbon so hes trying to make the ribbon come to him data does it pass near any mclass planets
yes sir there are two in the veridian system
its close to veridian three but not close enough data what would happen to the ribbons course if soran destroyed the veridian star itself thats where hes going
it should be noted sir that the collapse of the veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at amargosa
destroying all the planets in this system
veridian three is uninhabited however veridian four supports a preindustrial humanoid society
population
two hundred thirty million sir
picard to bridge
worf here sir
set a course for the veridian system maximum warp

did you get anything from the human
no his heart just wasnt in it
we have entered orbit of veridian three
prepare to transport me to the surface
wait when do we get our payment
this contains all the information youll need to make a trilithium weapon its been coded once im safely to the surface ill transmit the decryption sequence to you not before
mistress a federation starship is entering the system
what on viewer
they are hailing us
ducha 
were still cloaked they cant see us
klingon vessel we know what youre doing and we will destroy any probe launched toward the veridian star we demand that you return our chief engineer and leave this system immediately
theres no time for this eliminate them
thats a galaxyclass starship we are no match for them
i think its time we gave mister la forge his sight back

maybe theyre not out there
theyre just trying to decide whether a twenty yearold klingon birdofprey can be a match for the federation flagship
perhaps theyre on the surface
sir according to my calculations a solar probe launched from either the klingon ship or the planets surface will take eleven seconds to reach the sun however since we do not have an exact point of origin it will take us between eight and fifteen seconds to lock our weapons onto it
thats a pretty big margin of error much too big
mister data how long before the ribbon arrives
approximately fortyseven minutes sir
ive got to find some way to get to soran
klingon vessel decloaking directly ahead sir they are hailing
on screen
captain what an unexpected pleasure
lursa it is very important that i speak with soran
im afraid the doctor is no longer aboard our ship
then i will beam to his location
the doctor values his privacy he would be quite upset if an armed away team interrupted him
then i will beam to your ship and you can transport me to soran
captain you cant trust them for all you know they killed geordi they might kill you too
we did not harm your engineer hes been our guest
then return him
in exchange for what
me sir
me i will be your prisoner but first you must beam me to the surface so i can speak with soran
the captain would make a much more valuable hostage
well consider it a prisoner exchange
agreed have doctor crusher meet me in transporter room three you have the bridge number one

receiving the coordinates captain
energise



welcome captain you must think im quite the madman
the thought had crossed my mind
i know why youre here youre not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe so youve come to dissuade me from my horrific plan good luck now if youll excuse me captain im rather busy
soran

do be careful captain thats a fifty gigawatt forcefield i wouldnt want to see you get hurt

i have established the link
put it on viewer its working the visors transmitting
where is he

 dont worry theres been no permanent damage your heart is perfectly fine theres been a little arterial damage
human females are so repulsive

theres a myocardial degeneration ive removed the nanaprobe and i think youre going to be fine ill need to run some more tests ill let you know
thanks doc
data its okay
i am sorry i let you down i have not been behaving like myself lately
no data you havent youve been behaving like a human

you dont need to do this soran im sure we could find another way of getting you into this nexus
ive spent eighty years looking for another way believe me this is the only one

what youre about to do soran is no different from when the borg destroyed your world they killed millions too including your wife and children
nice try you know there was a time when i wouldnt hurt a fly then the borg came and they showed me that if there is one constant in this whole universe its death afterwards i began to realise it didnt really matter were all going to die sometime its just a question of how and when you will too captain arent you beginning to feel time gaining on you its like a predator its stalking you oh you can try and outrun it with doctors medicines new technologies but in the end time is going to hunt you down and make the kill
its our mortality that defines us soran its part of the truth of our existence
what if i told you ive found a new truth
the nexus
time has no meaning there the predator has no teeth

where is he now
he bathed now hes roaming the ship he must be the only engineer who doesnt go to engineering

any luck mister worf
no sir i still cannot locate the captain
the sensors still cannot penetrate the planet biosphere theres too much interference can you find a way to scan for lifeforms
i would be happy to sir i just love scanning for lifeforms life forms you tiny little lifeforms you precious little life forms where are you

finally

commander id like to run a level three diagnostic on the port plasma relays i think one of the generators is fluctuating
fine do that

thats it replay from time index nine two four magnify this section and enhance their shields are operating on a modulation of two five seven point four
adjust our torpedo frequency to match two five seven point four


they have found a way to penetrate our shields
lock phasers and return fire deanna take the helm get us out of orbit
hull breach on decks thirtyone through thirtyfive
mister worf what do we know about that old klingon ship are there any weaknesses
it is a class dtwelve bird of prey they were retired from service because of defective plasma coils
plasma coils any way we can use that to our advantage
i do not see how the plasma coil is part of their cloaking device

lets get a stabiliser on that conduit reinforce that starboard interlock reroute main power through the secondary coupling

data would a defective plasma coil be susceptible to some sort of ionic pulse
perhaps yes yes if we sent a lowlevel ionic pulse it might reset the coil and trigger the cloaking device excellent idea sir
as their cloak begins to engage their shields will drop
well thats two seconds theyll be vulnerable mister data lock on to their plasma coils
no problem
our shields are holding

fire at will

mister worf prepare a spread of photon torpedoes well have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak
aye sir
were getting one shot at this target their primary reactor
i have accessed their coil frequency initiating ionic pulse
make it quick


target their bridge
full disruptors
we are cloaking
what
our shields are down


yes mm


havent you got anything better to do


it must have been that last torpedo la forge to bridge ive got a problem down here the magnetic interlocks have been ruptured i

coolant leak we have a coolant leak everybody lets go lets get out of here everybody out lets move lets move let go bridge we have a new problem were five minutes from a warp core breach theres nothing i can do

deanna evacuate everyone to the saucer section mister data prepare to separate the ship

starship separation in five minutes starship separation in four minutes thirtyfive seconds

lets move him out lets go take him out quick

starship separation in four minutes thirty seconds

starship separation in four minutes fifteen seconds
farrell
yes
theres no one with these kids lets get them to the wtube well find the parents later
starship separation in four minutes

now youll have to excuse me captain i have an appointment with eternity and i dont want to be late


the core breach is accelerating weve go to get out of here
thats it bridge were all out

one minute to warp core breach
begin separation sequence full impulse power once were clear warp core is going critical
separation complete
engaging impulse engines
core breach in progress
primary stabilisers offline engaging secondary systems
report
helm controls are offline
oh shit




i have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters im attempting to level our descent
all hands brace for impact

hold on there tight hold on

hold their heads


im okay





what what is this where am i

surprise
we love you father
were you scared
i helped decorate the tree
i helped decorate it it took all day
say merry christmas papa
seen your present
i love you father
and i love you too
move back and give your father some room cup of earl grey
that would be perfect dear
this ones for you
oh thank you very much ren
merry christmas uncle
and merry christmas to you too
ren can you help me with the table
ren come here go and help your aunt

this isnt right this cant be real
its as real as you want it to be
guinan whats going on why am i here
youre in the nexus
this is the nexus
for you this is what you wanted
but i never had a home like this nor a wife and children but these are all mine guinan what are you doing here i thought you were on board the enterprise
i am im also here think of me as an echo of the person you know a part of herself she left behind
when the enterpriseb beamed you up from the lakul
papa help me build my castle
yes i will in a few minutes
papa thank you for the dolly shes very beautiful
these are my children these are my children
of course time has no meaning here so you can go back and see them born or go forward and see your grandchildren
dinners ready everyone
dinners ready papa
go on go on without me
guinan can i leave the nexus
where would you go
i dont understand
but as i said time has no meaning here so if you leave you can go anywhere any time
all right i know exactly where i want to go the mountaintop on veridian three just before soran destroyed the star i have to stop it but i need help now if you were to come back with me together we c
i cant leave here im there already remember but i bet i know someone who can


and from his point of view he just got there too
kirk james t kirk
beautiful day
yes it certainly is
would you mind
oh

captain im wondering do you realise
hold on a minute do you smell something burning

looks like somebody was trying to cook some eggs come on in its all right its my house at least it used to be i sold it years ago
im captain jeanluc picard of the starship enterprise
the clock i gave this clock to bones
im from what you would consider the future the twentyfourth century

butler butler how can you be here hes been dead seven years
come on jim im starving how long have you been rattling around in that kitchen
antonia what are you talking about the future this is the past this is nine years ago

the day i told her i was going back to starfleet
these are ktarian eggs it was her favourite i was preparing them to soften the blow
i know how real this must seem to you but its not this isnt really your house were both of us caught up in some kind of temporal nexus
dill
i beg your pardon
dill weed in the cabinet second shelf to the left behind the oregano
how long have you been here
i dont know i was aboard the enterpriseb in the deflector control room stir these will you

ow
the bulkhead in front of me disappeared then i found myself out here just now chopping wood right before you walked up thanks
look history records that you died saving the enterpriseb from an energy ribbon eighty years ago
you say this is the twentyfourth century
aha
and im dead
not exactly as i said this is some kind of
temporal nexus
yeah i heard you something is missing

captain look i need your help i want you to leave the nexus with me we have to go back to a planet veridian three we have to stop a man called soran from destroying a star millions of lives are at stake
you said history considers me dead who am i to argue with history
you are a starfleet officer you have a duty
i dont need you to lecture me i was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was in diapers besides which i think the galaxy owes me one all right i was like you once so completely blinded by duty and obligations that i couldnt see anything past this uniform and in the end what did it get me an empty house not this time

this time im going to walk up these stairs march into that bedroom and tell antonia that i want to marry her this time its going to be different


this is not your bedroom
no its not its better
better
this is my uncles barn in idaho i took this horse out for a ride eleven years ago on a spring day like this if im right this is the day i met antonia this nexus of yours is very clever i can start all over again and do things right from day one



i must have jumped that fifty times scared the hell out of me except this time because it isnt real

antonia
she isnt real either is she nothing here is nothing here matters
you know maybe this is less about an empty house than that empty chair on the bridge of the enterprise ever since i left starfleet i havent made a difference captain of the enterprise huh
thats right
close to retirement
im not planning on it
let me tell you something dont dont let them promote you dont let them transfer you dont let them do anything that takes you off the bridge of that ship because while youre there you can make a difference
come back with me help me stop soran make a difference again
who am i to argue with the captain of the enterprise whats the name of that planet veridian three
yes
i take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim
you could say that
you know if spock were here hed say i was an irrational illogical human being for taking on a mission like that sounds like fun

i have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters im attempting to level our descent
all hands brace for impact



just who the hell are you
hes james t kirk dont you read history ive got to get to the launcher the ribbon will be here in a minute
ill take care of soran

actually i am familiar with history captain and if im not too much mistaken youre dead

i thought you were heading for the launcher
i changed my mind captains prerogative

we need that control padd captain look wheres soran

were running out of time look the control padd is still on the other side
ill get it you go for the launcher
no youll never make it by yourself weve got to work together
we are working together trust me
good luck captain
call me jim

picard get away from that launcher now

did we do it did we make a difference
oh yes we made a difference thank you
its the least i could do for the captain of the enterprise it was fun oh my

captains log stardate  three starfleet vessels have arrived in orbit and have begun to beam up the enterprise survivors our casualties are light but unfortunately the enterprise herself cannot be salvaged

it has been extremely difficult counselor
then why did you decide not to remove the emotion chip
at first i was unprepared for the unpredictable nature of the emotions however having experienced two hundred and sixtyone distinct emotional states i believe i have learned to control my feelings they will no longer control me
well i hope youre successful data data over here ive found something one life sign very faint
spot im very happy to see you spot
another family reunited data are you all right
i am uncertain counselor i am happy to see spot and yet i am crying perhaps the chip is malfunctioning
i think its working perfectly
hello spot

is this it
yes thats it number one thank you

im going to miss this ship she went before her time
someone once told me that time is a predator that stalks us all our lives i rather believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey and reminds us to cherish every moment because theyll never come again what we leave behind is not as important as how we lived after all number one were only mortal
speak for yourself sir i plan to live forever

i always thought id get a shot at this chair one day
you may still will somehow i doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name enterprise  picard to farragut two to beam up

insurrection

encounter at farpoint

captains log stardate  our destination is planet deneb four beyond which lies the great unexplored mass of the galaxy my orders are to examine farpoint a starbase built there by the inhabitants of that world meanwhile i am becoming better acquainted with my new command this galaxy class uss enterprise i am still somewhat in awe of its size and complexity as for my crew we are short in several key positions most notably a first officer but i am informed that a highly experienced man one commander william riker will be waiting to join our ship at our deneb four destination

you will agree data that starfleets orders are difficult
difficult simply solve the mystery of farpoint station
as simple as that
farpoint station even the name sounds mysterious
its hardly simple data to negotiate a friendly agreement for starfleet to use the base while at the same time snoop around finding how and why the life form there built it
inquiry the word snoop
data how can you be programmed as a virtual encyclopedia of human information without knowing a simple word like snoop
possibility a kind of human behaviour i was not designed to emulate
it means to spy to sneak
ah to seek covertly to go stealthily to slink slither
exactly yes
glide creep skulk pussyfoot gumshoe
captain im sensing a powerful mind

something strange on the detector circuits

it registers as solid captain
or an incredibly powerful forcefield but if we collide with either it could be very
shut off that damned noise go to yellow alert
shields and deflectors up sir

reverse power full stop
controls to full stop sir now reading full stop sir

thou are notified that thy kind hath infiltrated the galaxy too far already thou art directed to return to thine own solar system immediately
thats quite a directive would you mind identifying what you are
we call ourselves the q or thou mayst call me that its all much the same thing

i present myself to thee as a fellow ship captain that thou mayst better understand me go back whence thou camest  stay where thou art

data call medics
hes frozen
he would not have injured you do you recognise this the stun setting
knowing humans as thou dost captain wouldst thou be captured helpless by them now go back or thou shalt most certainly die
captains log supplementary the frozen form of lieutenant torres has been rushed to sickbay the question now is the incredible power of the q being do we dare oppose it

captain thy little centuries go by so rapidly perhaps thou will better understand this

actually the issue at stake is patriotism you must return to your world and put an end to the commies all it takes is a few good men
what that nonsense is centuries behind us
but you cant deny that youre still a dangerous savage child race
most certainly i deny it i agree we still were when humans wore costumes like that four hundred years ago
at which time you slaughtered millions in silly arguments about how to divide the resources of your little world and four hundred years before that you were murdering each other in quarrels over tribal godimages since there are no indications that humans will ever change
but even when we wore costumes like that wed already started to make rapid progress
oh yeah you want to review your rapid progress

rapid progress to where humans learned to control their military with drugs
sir sickbay reports lieutenant torress condition is better
oh concern for ones fellow comrade how touching
and now a personal request sir permission to clean up the bridge
lieutenant worf is right sir as security chief i cant just stand here and let
yes you can lieutenant yar
 oh better and later on finally reaching deep space humans of course found enemies to fight out there too and to broaden those struggles you again found allies for still more murdering the same old story all over again
no the same old story is the one were meeting now selfrighteous life forms who are eager not to learn but to prosecute to judge anything they dont understand or cant tolerate
what an interesting idea prosecute and judge suppose it turns out we understand you humans only too well
weve no fear of what the true facts about us will reveal
facts about you splendid splendid captain youre a veritable fountain of good ideas there are preparations to make but when we next meet captain well proceed exactly as you suggest

sir respectfully submit our only choice is to fight
fight or try to escape
sense anything commander
its mind is much too powerful recommend we avoid contact
from this point no station aboard repeat no station for any reason will make use of transmitted signals or intercom well try and take them by surprise lets see what this galaxy class starship can do  lieutenant inform engine room to prepare for maximum acceleration
aye sir
records search data results of detaching saucer section at high warp velocity
inadvisable at any warp speed sir
search theoretical
it is possible sir but absolutely no margin for error
using printout only notify all decks to prepare for maximum acceleration now hear this maximum youre entitled to know means that well be pushing our engines well beyond safety limits our hope is to surprise whatever that is out there try and outrun it our only other option is to tuck tail between our legs and return to earth as they demand

engine room ready sir
the board shows green captain all go
stand by engage

velocity warp nine point two
heading three five one mark eleven sir
steady on that
the hostile is now giving chase sir accelerating fast
were now at warp nine point three sir which takes us past the red line sir
continue accelerating counsellor at this point im open to guesses about what weve just met
it it felt like something beyond what wed consider a life form
beyond
very very advanced sir or certainly very very different
were at nine point four sir
hostile is now beginning to overtake us sir
are you sure
hostiles velocity is already warp nine point six sir shall i put them on the main viewer
reverse angle
magnifying viewer image
hostiles velocity is nine point seven sir
worf inform the engine room we need more
engine room attempting to comply sir but they caution us
go to yellow alert arm aft photon torpedoes place them on ready status
torpedoes to ready sir
hostile now at warp nine point eight sir
our velocity is only nine point five sir
projection sir we may be able to match hostiles nine point eight sir but at extreme risk
now reading the hostile at warp nine point nine sir
now hear this printout message urgent all stations on all decks prepare for emergency saucer sever you will command the saucer section lieutenant
i am a klingon sir for me to seek escape when my captain goes into battle
you are a starfleet officer lieutenant
aye sir
make the mark data note in ships log that at this startime im transferring command to the battle bridge

captains log stardate  preparing to detach saucer section so that families and the majority of the ships company can seek relative safety while the vessels stardrive containing the battle bridge and main armaments will turn back and confront the mystery that is threatening us


lieutenant your torpedoes must detonate close enough to the hostile to blind it at the moment we separate
understood sir
all decks acknowledging sir
worf this is the captain

at the moment of separation we will reverse power just enough to get your saucer section out ahead and clear of us
understood captain

torpedoes away sir

begin countdown mark
starship separation in six five four three two one

separation is successful sir

torpedoes have detonated sir
lets come to a stop reverse power
reverse power decelerating
dead stop well hold this position and wait for them
that will bring them here in just minutes sir
will we make a fight of it captain if we can at least damage their ship well have a chance
lieutenant are you recommending we fight a life form that can do all those things id like to hear your advice
i spoke before i thought sir we should look for some way to distract them from going after the saucer
all forward motion stopped sir
thank you conn commander signal the following in all languages and on all frequencies we surrender state that we are not asking for any terms or conditions
aye sir all language forms and frequencies



the prisoners will all stand

historically intriguing captain very very accurate
mid twenty first century the postatomic horror
all present stand and make respectful attention to honoured judge
careful sir this is not an illusion or a dream
but these courts happened in the past
i dont understand either but this is real
get to your feet criminals

at least we are acquainted with the judge captain

attention on your feet attention

 you are out of order  the prisoners will not be harmed until they are found guilty dispose of that
can we assume you mean this will be a fair trial
yes absolutely equitable proceed
before this gracious court now appear these prisoners to answer for the multiple and grievous savageries of their species how plead you criminal
if i may captain objection your honour in the year  the new united nations declared that no earth citizen could be made to answer for the crimes of his race or forbears
objection denied this is a court of the year  by which time more rapid progress had caused all united earth nonsense to be abolished
tasha no
i must because i grew up on a world that allowed things like this court and it was people like these that saved me from it this socalled court should get down on its knees to what starfleet is what it represents

you barbarian this woman
criminals keep silence
youve got a lot to learn about humans if you think you can torture us or frighten us into silence will she live
uncertain when he froze lieutenant torres on the bridge we had our sickbay to help thaw him out
you will answer the charges criminals
or what or this her death or worse you promised the prisoners will not be harmed we plead nothing so long as you break your own rules
i suggest you centre your attention on this trial captain it may be your only hope
i suggest you are now having second thoughts it you are considering that if you conduct a fair trial which was your promise you may lose
lose
yes even though youre judge and prosecutor
and jury
accepted so long as you keep to your agreement and assaulting prisoners is hardly a fair trial
this is a merciful court  silence continuing these proceedings i must caution you that legal trickery is not permitted this is a court of
court of fact we humans know our past even when were ashamed of it i recognise this court system as the one that agreed with that line from shakespeare
kill all the lawyers

which was done
which led to the rule guilty until proven innocent
of course bringing the innocent to trial would be unfair you will now answer to the charge of being a grievously savage race
grievously savage could mean anything i will answer only specific charges
are you certain you want a full disclosure of human ugliness so be it fool present the charges
criminal you will read the charges to the court

i see no charges against us your honour
you are out of order

soldiers you will press those triggers if this criminal answers with any word other than guilty criminal how plead you
guilty provisionally
the court will hear the provision
we question whether this court is abiding by its own trial instructions have i have permission to have commander data repeat the record
there will be no legal trickery
these will be your own words your honour what exactly what followed his honours statement that the prisoner will not be harmed
yes sir the captain had asked the question can we assume you mean this will be a fair trial and in reply the judge stated yes absolutely equitable
irrelevant testimony entirely irrelevant
alright we agree there is evidence to support the courts contention that humans have been savage therefore i say test us test whether this is presently true of humans
i see i see and so you petition the court to accept you and your comrades as proof of what humanity has become
there must be many ways we can be tested we have a long mission ahead of us
another brilliant suggestion captain but your test hardly requires a long mission your immediate destination offers far more challenge than you can possibly imagine yes this farpoint station will be an excellent test
all present respectfully stand
this trial is adjourned to allow the criminals to be tested
this honourable court is adjourned stand respectfully
captain you may find you are not nearly clever enough to deal with what lies ahead for you it may have been better to accept sentence here


what is present course conn
its what its been all along sir direct heading to farpoint station
confirm we are on that heading sir
know anything about farpoint station sir sounds like a fairly dull place
weve heard that we may find it rather interesting
personal log commander william riker stardate  the uss hood has dropped me off at farpoint station where i await the arrival of the new uss enterprise to which i have been assigned as first officer meanwhile i have been asked to visit the farpoint administrators office in the old city


ah commander riker i thought youd want to know weve still no word from your vessel i trust we made your waiting comfortable
luxurious is more like it
good  good
would i seem ungrateful if i ask for some information
anything
fascinating the advanced materials used in constructing this space station your energy supply must be as abundant as ive heard
geothermal energy is the one great blessing of this planet ill have all the details of that sent to your quarters
thank you but it still seems incredible to me that you could have constructed this station so rapidly and so so perfectly suited to our needs
would your care for an earth delicacy commander
 if theres an apple
im sorry commander
it doesnt matter what i was saying was  ill be damned
ah yes there was another selection here
groppler i could have sworn it wasnt here a minute ago
and did your failure to notice it make it unwelcome
not at all groppler
i trust it will be the same with farpoint station commander a few easily answered questions about it wont make starfleet appreciate it less
and its delicious thank you good morning groppler zorn
good morning

 you have been told not to do that why cant you understand it will arouse their suspicion and if that happens we will have to punish you we will i promise you

doctor crusher
mother its commander riker
hello wes enjoying farpoint station
yes sir
i saw you i thought i might join you for a stroll
actually we were about to do some shopping
ive been meaning to visit the mall myself
of course
if youre wondering about mom commander riker shes not unfriendly shes just shy around men she doesnt know
wesley i believe that means he would like us to be friends
im willing doctor although were not officially part of the enterprise i thought there might be something useful we can do while we wait
useful how commander
investigating some things that ive noticed since ive been here the last was a piece of fruit
 gold would be lovely with this i am sure commander there are reasons for a first officer to want to demonstrate his energy and alertness to a new captain but since my duty and interests are outside the command structure

isnt it remarkable they happen to have exactly what you asked for
thank you ill take the entire bolt send it to our starship when it arrives charge to doctor crusher

lets see where were we
i was accusing you of inventing work in order to curry favour with our new captain i apologise
mom that gold pattern wasnt there
maybe this is something jeanluc would like looked into
jeanluc picard you know the captain
when i was little he brought my fathers body home to us
yes wes long long ago a pleasure to meet you commander you will excuse us
my pleasure doctor wes
sir
see you on board
yes sir

sir the enterprise is arriving
is this an official report lieutenant
sorry commander sir lieutenant la forge reporting the enterprise arriving but without the saucer section sir
stardrive section only what happened
i dont know sir captain picard has signalled for you to beam up immediately
our new captain doesnt waste time its a good idea thank you lieutenant
aye sir
 enterprise this is commander riker at farpoint station standing by to beam up


lieutenant yar of security sir captain picard will see you on the battle bridge

with the saucer gone i assume something interesting happened on your way here

battle bridge thats for the captain to explain sir

do we have clearance
aye sir into the standard parking orbit
make it so
commander riker sir
riker wt reporting as ordered sir
is the viewer ready
all set up sir
well first bring you up to date on a little adventure we had on our way here commander then well talk welcome aboard
 this way sir

thou art directed to return to thine own solar system immediately go back or thou shalt most certainly die you cant deny youre still a dangerous savage child race
message from the saucer module sir it will arrive here in fifty one minutes
inform them well connect as soon as they arrive and sent the commander to me when hes finished
yes sir

and four hundred years before that you were murdering each other in quarrels over tribal god images since then there are no indications that humans will ever change there are preparations to make and when we next meet captain well proceed exactly as you suggest
he calls that a little adventure

come
not exactly a run of the mill happening captain
it seems were alive only because we have been placed on probation a very serious kind of probation  go
the saucer module is now entering orbit with us sir
acknowledged commander riker will conduct a manual docking picard out
sir
youve reported in havent you you are qualified
yes sir
then i mean now commander

they say you will be doing this manually sir no automation
as ordered

velocity to one half metre per second adjust pitch angle negative three degrees watch your roll angle conn all stations prepare for reconnection thrusters to station keeping all velocity zero her inertia should do the job now lock up now


a fairly routine manoeuvre but you handled it quite well
thank you sir i hope i showed some promise
i do have some questions for you though
yes sir i thought you might
i see in your file that captain desoto thinks very highly of you one curious thing however you refused to let him beam down to altair three
in my opinion sir altair three was too dangerous to risk exposing the captain
i see a captains rank means nothing to you
rather the reverse sir but a captains life means a great deal to me
isnt it just possible that you dont get to be a starfleet captain without knowing whether its safe to beam down or not isnt it a little presumptuous of a first officer to second guess his captains judgment
permission to speak candidly sir
always
having been a first officer yourself you know that assuming that responsibility must by definition include the safety of the captain i have no problem with following any rules you lay down short of compromising your safety
and you dont intend to back off that position
no sir
one further thing a special favour
anything sir
using the same kind of strength you showed with captain desoto i would appreciate it if you can keep me from making an ass of myself with children
sir
im not a family man riker and yet starfleet has given me a ship with children aboard
yes sir
and i dont feel comfortable with children but since a captain needs an image of geniality youre to see thats what i project
aye sir
welcome to the enterprise commander riker

naturally ive heard of your case the visor implants you wear
is a remarkable piece of bioelectronic engineering by which i quote see much of the em spectrum ranging from simple heat and infrared through radio waves et cetera et cetera and forgive me if ive said and listened to this a thousand times before

youve been blind all your life
i was born this way
and youve felt pain all the years that youve used this
they say its because i use my natural sensors in different ways
well i see two choices the first is painkillers
which would affect how this works no choice number two
exploratory surgery desensitise the brain areas troubling you
same difference no thank you doctor
i understand
see you


yes sir
where will i find commander data
commander data is on special assignment sir hes using our shuttlecraft to transfer an admiral over to the hood
an admiral
hes been aboard all day sir checking over medical layout
why a shuttlecraft why wouldnt he just beam over
i suppose he could sir but the admirals a rather remarkable man


have you got some reason you want my atoms scattered all over space boy
no sir but at your age sir i thought you shouldnt have to put up with the time and trouble of a shuttlecraft
hold it right there boy
sir
what about my age
sorry sir if that subject troubles you
troubles me whats so damned troubling about not having died how old do you think i am
one hundred thirty seven years admiral according to starfleet records
explain how you remember that so exactly
i remember every fact i am exposed to sir
i dont see any points on your ears boy but you sound like a vulcan
no sir im an android
almost as bad
i thought it was generally accepted sir that vulcans are an advanced and most honourable race
they are they are and damned annoying at times
yes sir
well this is a new ship but shes got the right name now you remember that you hear
i will sir
you treat her like a lady and shell always bring you home

did you signal the hood commander riker
your exact message bon voyage mon ami
what was my answer computer
youre wasting time captain  or did you think i was gone
lieutenant do you intend to blast a hole through the viewer if the purpose of this is to test humans your honour we must proceed in our own way
you are dilatory you have twenty four hours any further delay and you risk summary judgement against you captain
sorry sir
you reacted fast mister worf
but futilely
i will learn to do better sir
of course you will weve a long voyage ahead of us
what do we do now captain with them monitoring our every move and every word
we do exactly what we would do if this q never existed if were going to be damned lets be damned for what we really are
personal log stardate  of the twenty four hours q allotted us to prove ourselves eleven have now passed without incident and yet i cannot forget qs prediction that we will face some critical test

this planets interior heat provides an abundance of geothermal energy sir but its about all this world does offer
and its your belief that this is what made it possible for them to construct this base to starfleet standards
yes sir we have to assume that theyve been trading their surplus energy for the construction materials used here according to our ships scans many of the materials used are not found on this world
perhaps its like those incidents you describe in your report as almost magical attempts to please us
those events did happen sir
none of it suggests anything threatening if only every life form had as much desire to please ready to beam down im looking forward to meeting this groppler zorn
i have a feeling theres more to it than just pleasing us sir

as if its something q is doing to trick us over here ive asked the counsellor to join us in this meeting may i introduce our new first officer commander william riker commander riker this is our ships counsellor deanna troi
do you remember what i taught you imzadi can you still sense my thoughts
a pleasure commander
likewise counsellor
have the two of you met before
we have sir
excellent i consider it important for my key officers know each others abilities

we do sir we do
i too would never say goodbye imzadi

my crew and i need a bit more information before we make our recommendations to starfleet
no objections to that but but im puzzled over you bringing a betazoid to this if her purpose sir is to probe my thoughts
i can sense only strong emotions groppler i am only half betazoid my father was a starfleet officer
well i have nothing to hide of course
good since we admire what weve seen of your construction techniques starfleet may be interested in your constructing starbases elsewhere also
we are not interested in building other facilities
if i may captain then a trade groppler some things you need in return for lending us architects and engineers who can demonstrate your techniques
bandi do not enjoy leaving their home world if starfleet cannot accept that small weakness then we will be forced unhappily to seek an alliance with someone like the ferengi or

counsellor what is it
do you want it described here sir
yes no secrets here if were to be all to be friends agreed groppler
we ourselves have nothing to hide of course
pain pain loneliness terrible loneliness despair im not sensing the groppler sir or any of his people but its something very close to us here
the source of this groppler do you have any idea
no no absolutely not and i find nothing helpful or productive in any of this
and thats it no other comment
well what do you expect of us we offer you a base designed to your needs luxurious even by human standards
while evading even our simplest questions about it well adjourn for now while we all reconsider our positions
captain the ferengi would be very interested in a base like this
fine i hope they find you as tasty as they did their past associates

ensign can you help me find commander data i understand hes somewhere on this deck
this way sir you must be new to these galaxy class starships sir  tell me the location of commander data
lieutenant commander data now located in holodeck area j
and as you see sir its pointing you that way
thank you
youre welcome sir

the next hatchway on your right
thank you
youre welcome commander riker and if you care to enter commander
i do


hello

marvellous how easily humans do that i still need much practice
there are some puzzles down on the planet that the captain wants answered he suggests that i take you with me on the away team that ill be leading
i shall endeavour to function adequately sir
yes when the captain suggested you i looked up your record
yes sir a wise procedure sir always
then your rank of lieutenant commander is honorary
no sir starfleet class of  honours in probability mechanics and exobiology
your file says that youre an
machine correct sir does that trouble you
to be honest yes a little
understood sir prejudice is very human
now that does trouble me do you consider yourself superior to us
i am superior sir in many ways but i would gladly give it up to be human
nice to meet you pinocchio a joke
ah intriguing
youre going to be an interesting companion mister data
this woodland pattern is quite popular sir perhaps because it duplicates earth so well coming here almost makes me feel human myself
i didnt believe these simulations could be this real
much of it is real sir if the transporters can convert our bodies to an energy beam then back to the original pattern again
yes of course and these rocks and vegetation have much simpler patterns
correct sir the rear wall
i cant see it
were right next to it

incredible
commander riker
 commander riker isnt this great this is one of the simpler patterns theyve got thousands more some you just cant believe
careful the next rock is loose

wesley

wow

mister data has agreed to join me on the away team captain
very good commander
sir maybe i should get something to wipe this water up
good idea

theres a low gravity gymnasium too itd be hard to get bored on this ship
good
mom could you get me a look at the bridge
thats against the captains standing orders
are you afraid of the captain too
i certainly am not
but captain picard is a pain isnt he
your father liked him very much great explorers are often lonely no chance to have a family
just a look at the bridge ill stay in the turbolift when the doors open i wont get off
you are asking for trouble wes well see what we can do

recommend that someone could begin by examining the underside of the station sir
our sensors do show some passages sir perhaps you and i
tasha you and the counsellor and geordi i want your eyes down there  you and i will start with topside

have you noticed anything unusual
i cant see as well as geordi sir but so far the material seems rather very ordinary
construction records
construction records show this to be almost identical to that which starfleet uses
team leader

weve found something interesting were in a passageway directly under the station sir
but these tunnel walls are something ive never seen before sir

how are you examining them
in every way

microscopically thermally electromagnetically none of it is familiar
what about you troi
sir ive avoided opening my mind whatever i felt in the gropplers office became very uncomfortable

im sorry counsellor but you must we need more information

pain such pain pain

hang on im coming enterprise lock us onto her signal


im sorry close your mind to the pain
unhappiness terrible despair
who
i dont know no life form anything like us
what in the hell kind of place is this geordi what do you see
well its of no material i recognise sir or have even heard of



children are not allowed on the bridge

permission to report to the captain
doctor crusher
captain sir my son is not on the bridge he merely accompanied me on the turbolift
your son
his names wesley you last saw him years ago when
well as long as hes here i knew your father wesley want a look around

but dont touch anything try it out  the panel on your right is for log entries library computer access and retrieval viewscreen control intercoms and so on here we have
and here the backup conn and ops panels plus shield and armoury controls
the forward viewscreen is controlled from the ops position there
which uses high resolution multispectral imaging sensor systems
how the hell do you know that boy
perimeter alert captain
wesley
im sorry
you shouldnt have touched anything
off the bridge both of you
you have a perimeter alert sir
as my son tried to tell you

picard go ahead
ships sensors have detected the presence of a vessel approaching this planet no ship is scheduled to arrive at this time sir
have commander riker and his team beam back up security could that be the hood returning here
the vessel does not match the hoods configuration or id signal
put it on main viewer identification
vessel unknown configuration unknown sir

hail it
weve been trying sir no response
raise all shields phasers at ready
shields up sir phasers ready
get me groppler zorn and continue universal greetings on all frequencies
this is zorn captain
zorn an unidentified vessel has entered into orbit with us

do you know who it is
there are no ships scheduled to arrive until

i asked if you knew who it is you mentioned the ferengi alliance to me

but we have had no dealings with them it was only a a thought

are you certain
i promise you captain

we were making an empty threat i wanted your cooperation forgive me

definitely entering orbital trajectory sir
 it measures twelve times our volume captain

sensors say we were just scanned sir

pain again
troi youve been at it enough
no i feel close to an answer of some kind
commander something down here is shielding our communicators
yes thats exactly the feeling ive been reading as if someone doesnt want us to be in touch with our ship
come on lets get to the surface

there is no computer record of any such vessel sir nothing even close
still no response sir weve done everything but threaten them
sensor scans mister worf
our sensor signals seem to just bounce off somethings happening sir theyre firing on farpoint sir
bring photon torpedoes to ready
wait sir theyre hitting the old bandi city not farpoint station



those stairs are where we entered down here sir
at this point it becomes ordinary stone sir matching whats above
my god was that a phaser blast
negative but something similar
you tasha and geordi will beam up to the ship now come on i want to see exactly whats happening
dont if you should be hurt
you have your orders lieutenant carry them out
yes sir im sorry sir enterprise three to beam up

enterprise enterprise come in help us please what shall we do

enterprise help us please
tune that down commander riker come in can you hear me


riker to enterprise come in
commander riker come in where are you
with data on the edge of the old city sir its being hit hard sir

and farpoint station any damage there
negative on damage to farpoint sir whoever they are it seems theyre carefully avoiding hitting the station
its from an unidentified vessel thats entered into orbit with us here

no id no answer to our signals
the old bandi citys being hit hard sir many casualties very probable
understand commander

would you object to your captain ordering a clearly illegal kidnapping

no objection sir

groppler zorn may have the answers we need get him bring him here

aye sir

theyre forcing a difficult decision on me counsellor
but i doubt protecting the bandi would violate the prime directive true they are not actual allies but
we are in the midst of diplomatic discussions with them lieutenant lock phasers on that vessel
phasers locked on captain

typical so typical savage lifeforms never follow even their own rules
get off my bridge
interesting that order about phasers
standing by on phasers captain
please dont let me interfere use your weapons
weve no idea who is on that vessel my order was a routine safety precaution
really no idea of what it represents the meaning of that vessel is as plain as plain as the noses on your ugly little primate faces and if you were truly civilised captain wouldnt you be doing something about the casualties happening down there
captain to cmo

are you reading any of this
medical teams already preparing to beam down captain

compliments on that doctor any questions starfleet people are trained to render aid and assistance whenever
but not trained in clear thinking
lets consider your thoughts you call us savages and yet you knew those people down there would be killed it is your conduct that is uncivilised
sir theyre firing on the planet again
go to manoeuvring jets position us between that vessel and the planet force fields full on
aye sir impulse power to  we have no ship control sir its gone


are you undamaged
yes you
all systems operating



please make it stop you can drive it away
drive who away groppler
i dont know
unlikely sir our records show that you supervised all bandi contact with other worlds
we done nothing anything wrong
then if we can learn nothing from you well leave
no oh no please dont leave ill try to explain
first officer to enterprise weve lost zorn something like a transporter beam seems to have snatched him away

question sir could it be this q
none of you knows who transported him youre running out of time captain
captain suddenly im sensing something else satisfaction enormous satisfaction
from the same source as before
no that was on the planet this is much closer
excellent counsellor hes such a dullard isnt he
captain from transporter room first officer and mister data have beamed aboard
excellent also perhaps with more of these little minds helping
that is enough damn it
have you forgotten that we have an agreement
an agreement which you are at this moment breaking by taking over our vessel interfering with my decisions either leave or finish us
temper temper mon capitaine im merely trying to assist a pitiful species but perhaps i will leave if commander riker provides me with some amusement
do nothing that he asks
but i ask so little and its so necessary if youre to solve all this beam over there with your what do you call it your away team
ill risk none of my crew on that unknown
you should already know what youll find there or perhaps its too adult a puzzle for you
with all respect captain i want to beam over there
you show promise my good fellow
have you understood any part of what hes tried to tell you humanity is no longer a savage race
but you must still prove that

at least you impressed him number one thats hopeful
thank you captain captain if hes not open to evidence in our favour where will you go from there
ill attend to my duty
to the bitter end
i see nothing so bitter about that

can i help you captain
i didnt want you thinking me harsh cold blooded
why oh why would i ever think that
i didnt welcome you aboard personally professionally i made you come to me on the bridge i yelled at your son who as you pointed out was quite correct he does seem to have a very good grasp of starship operations
youve just won this mothers heart captain
ah but now your assignment here i would consider and approve you a transfer for you
oh you consider me unqualified
hardly your service record shows youre just the chief medical officer i want
then you must object to me personally
im trying to be considerate of your feelings doctor for you to work with a commanding officer who would continually remind you of a terrible personal tragedy
if i had had any objections to serving with you i wouldnt have requested this assignment captain
you requested this posting
my feelings about my husbands death will have no effect on the way i serve you this vessel or this mission
ah then welcome aboard doctor

riker to picard were ready to beam over sir
i er i hope we can be friends
thank you


phasers on stun energise


most interesting sir
its much the same construction we saw in the underground tunnel
but no sound of power no equipment
how does this ship run
what is it troi is it the same as you felt down there
no this is much more powerful full of anger hate
toward us
no its directed down toward the old bandi city
most intriguing again sir the place that this vessel was firing upon was not the farpoint starbase but the home of those who constructed sorry sir i seem to be commenting on everything
good dont stop my friend

enterprise riker this is turning out to be a very long tunnel or corridor sir

no ships crew in sight no sign of mechanism or circuitry no controls or readouts this is nothing like any vessel ive seen before
groppler zorn sir a great fear just ahead

theres a different feeling here than in the tunnel very different

no please no more please no more please please make it stop please please please make it stop please

no please no more please no more please
zorn can you hear me
the pain no
has the alien communicated
please please please no more
thats it sir its just one alien that im sensing here
please i dont understand what you want
not true he does know
no please no more no more no no no dont


captain
transporter chief yank them back now riker acknowledge

your time is up captain
transporter chief do you have their coordinates transporter chief
he cant hear you captain
transporter chief come in ive people in trouble over there q

everyone at ease thats an order q my people are in trouble let me help them please ill do whatever you say

youll do whatever i say
it seems i did make that bargain
the agreement isnt valid sir it wasnt q that saved us
save yourself it may attack you now
it was that which sent us back captain
yes sir it is not merely a vessel sir somehow it is alive
she lies destroy it while you have a chance make phasers and photon torpedoes ready
no do nothing he demands
captain that thing was killing my people
was there a reason
it is an unknown captain isnt that enough
if youd earned that uniform youre wearing youd know that the unknown is what brings us out here
wasted effort considering the human intelligence
lets test that beginning with the tunnels you have under farpoint groppler
identical to the ones on the space vessel lifeform over there why was it punishing you groppler
in return for some pain youd given other creature
weve done nothing wrong it was injured we helped it
thank you that was the missing part lieutenant yar rig main phaser banks to deliver an energy beam
aye sir
youre right captain it has to be conceivable that somewhere in this galaxy there could exist creatures able to convert energy into matter
and into specific patterns of matter just as our transporters do
on the viewer captain

groppler you captured something like that didnt you
warn my people please to leave farpoint station immediately
he lies captain shouldnt you let his people die
transmit the message leave farpoint space station immediately
then it was a pair of creatures i was sensing one down there in grief and pain the other up here filled with anger
and firing not on the new space station but on the bandi and their city
attacking those who had captured capture its mate
energy beam ready sir
lock it in on farpoint station
i see now it was too simple a puzzle generosity has always been my weakness
let it have whatever it can absorb energise

now getting feedback on the beam sir
discontinue groppler zorn therell soon be no farpoint station if im right about this
a lucky guess

please believe me we meant no harm to the creature it was starving for energy
which your world furnishes you in plenty
we did feed it
only enough to keep it alive so that you could force it to shape itself into whatever form you needed

sir wonderful a feeling of great joy and gratitude great joy and gratitude from both of them
why do you use other lifeforms for recreation
if so youve not provided the best
leave us weve passed your little test
temper temper mon capitaine
get off my ship
i do so only because it suits me to but i will not promise never to appear again
captains log stardate  the agreement for the rebuilding farpoint station has been completed per my instructions

all stations
ready for departure sir
some problem riker
just hoping this isnt the usual way our missions will go sir
oh no number one im sure most will be much more interesting lets see whats out there engage
the naked now

captains log stardate  we are running at warp seven to rendezvous with the science vessel ss tsiolkovsky which has been routinely monitoring the collapse of a red super giant star into a white dwarf what has brought us here is a series of strange messages indicating something has gone wrong aboard the research vessel


ss tsiolkovsky repeat your message
well hello enterprise welcome i hope you have a lot of pretty boys on board because im willing and waiting in fact were going to have a real blowout here
do it yeah go ahead do it 
captain what we just heard is impossible
report
i believe that last sound we heard was an emergency hatch being blown
are you certain yes of course you are
data geordi tasha
sensor scan now reveals no life signs aboard captain



cover the ship as planned move out
indications of what humans would call a wild party

their bridge if this thing works be sure to record everything

you were right somebody blew the hatch they were all sucked out into space
correction sir thats blown out
thank you data
a common mistake sir
commander riker lieutenant yar location engineering ten people here sir all frozen no vital signs
frozen how
it looks like someone has been playing with the environmental controls sir just let all the heat bleed away into space


sir lieutenant la forge in the crew quarters something in here
he finds a door which is trying to close he opens it and a corpse falls out into his arms

riker to captain i have a report for you sir
picard here
theyre all dead

apparently some of them were apparently blown out the emergency hatches
but there were eighty people on that ship number one
yes sir

as i said all dead
captains log supplemental we are downloading the research information gathered on the collapsing star nearby i am concerned at being in such close orbit but the tsiolkovskys research records will no doubt predict the time of the stars final collapse

i cant find anything unusual in any of the tricorder readings theyve sent over captain
give me a theory doctor anything madness mass hysteria delusion
any or all captain
all right lets bring the away team back set the transporter to maximum decontamination and then full examination and observation when theyre here

if you were any more perfect data id write you up in a starfleet medical textbook
i am already listed in several biomechanical texts doctor
yes of course youre next lieutenant

normal all across except why are you perspiring lieutenant
i suppose because you have it too hot in here what else would it be
that doesnt sound like you geordi
well maybe its not maybe she threw her voice hey it was a joke
of course but i would like to run one or two more tests on you lieutenant

 sickbay to bridge
picard here go ahead doctor
 im confining lieutenant la forge to sickbay until further notice
do we have a problem doctor

i dont know yet

data i need help in locating some library computer information
specifics sir
all i have is a vague memory of reading somewhere about someone taking a shower in his or her clothing
ah the body geordi discovered
i believe it may have happened before
to someone somewhere
this ought to be easy for someone written up in biomechanical texts
about that sir did the doctor believe i was boasting
probably this may take some time
at least several hours but what i said was a statement of fact perhaps she will look it up
you can depend on it


geordi

security lieutenant la forge just left sickbay while i was in my office

he doesnt have his communicator it is very important that we find him
security team alert pick up lieutenant la forge he just left sickbay moments ago captain anything further
affirmative make it a shipwide search lieutenant


its a model of the same kind of tractor beam our ship uses with a few ideas of my own added
so thats your science project huh wes youre really something
and since the captain wont let me on the bridge i use this to imagine im there
take the helm mister crusher set a course for thirty seven mark one hundred eighty warp six
its the captains voice
its pieced together from words hes used on the intercom with this i can pretend hes ordering me to take the enterprise anywhere and listen to this
chief engineer report to the bridge commander riker report to the bridge doctor crusher report to the bridge
what do you think
i think the captains lucky youre on his side
but he still wont let me on the bridge and theres nothing there i dont understand
i wish i understood myself that well
are you okay
no suddenly i seem to be burning up inside its hot in here


geordi geordi lieutenant yar in the observation lounge send a team here now medicals been worried about you
help me help me to not to give in to the wild things coming into my mind
geordi my job is security
tasha please
alright alright helping is more important geordi how can i help you
help me to see like you do
but you already see better than i can
i see more but more isnt better

geordi please put
i want to see in shallow dim beautiful human ways

well talk about it geordi right now im going to take you to sickbay all right
yeah
okay good

and then we got him down to sickbay so doctor crusher could examine him
he wasnt violent
no sir he was very upset he kept talking about wanting normal vision
thank you lieutenant

according to our medical readouts theres still nothing wrong with him he looks like hes running a temperature but every instrument we have says hes not
doctor every person on that ship over there died is there any chance that whatever did it is loose on my ship
if you mean a disease sir id say theres no chance of it we used full decontamination we examined every team member very carefully
the entire crew somehow managed to kill themselves doctor if its not a disease what else could have made them do that
the obvious alternatives would be in areas of insanity and severe emotional upset troi do you feel anything unusual in the lieutenant
security just told me that he was longing for normal eyesight thats a sudden yearning for that
since his records show no previous mention of that the fact that its happened now could be important but all i sense from him is confusion if i didnt know better id say he was intoxicated
our tests would have shown that also any other signs of drugs hallucinogens or other contaminants


can you provide more information sir seeking an instance of someone showering in his or her clothing is
i know its like looking for a needle in a haystack
why should anyone wish to expend his time in such a search
correction data i should have said proverbial needle in a haystack
ah a human proverb as in folklore or an historical allusion or tribal memories
historical thats it i remember i was reading a history of all the past starships named enterprise
enterprise history aberrant behavior medical cross reference

captain i believe weve have the answer to what happened over there

the constitution class enterprise captain james t kirk commanding

similar conditions they were monitoring a planet that was breaking up not a collapsing star as in this case but there were the same huge shifts in gravity
which somehow resulted in complex strings of water molecules which acquired carbon from the body and acted on the brain like alcohol data download this information to medical immediately
aye sir downloading
fascinating the entire crew going out of control
like intoxication but worse judgment almost completely impaired
until they found this formula barely in time picard to doctor crusher come in

this is crusher go ahead captain
you can relax doctor

the answer to all of this is feeding into your medical banks right now including a cure

are you certain captain

absolutely


tasha what are you doing
i need your advice thats why i came to your quarters
of course anything i can do
on clothes you always wear such beautiful clothes off duty and your hair always looks so nice i want to change my image what do you think about this or this one
its not for you tasha i feel youre very uncertain yhat youre fighting something  what is it
never mind ill find what i need myself ships stores will have it
tasha tasha wait


troi to captain picard
picard here

sir i think tashas been infected too

she just left my quarters
counsellor its not actually an infection

yes sir its more like an intoxication nut whatever it is shes got it

thank you counsellor number one it seems our security chief has the equivalent of a snootful
inquiry sir snootful
forget it


hey mom look what i can do

ive been able to widen and strengthen the beam just like i told you last night
do me a favour wes theres something happening on this ship just to be safe id like you to stay in our quarters until its solved
sure mom sure your wish is my command
now wes
okay but you could be stunting my emotional growth you realise that why is it so hot in here anyway
picard to crusher
crusher here
have you made a test injection yet were getting indications that this condition is spreading
no test yet captain but very soon



captain another fortyone minutes will see the information from the tsiolkovsky downloaded to us
why so slow
slow sir the tsiolkovsky has been eight months in accumulating it
how much danger from that star worse case
like a full collapse sir any stellar material it threw this way we could still outrun on half impulse power

picard to engineering chief engineer report to the bridge

assistant chief engineer shimoda report to medical

hi jim was that the captain sending you to medical
which would leave no one on duty here the chief was just summoned to the bridge
what about me i could call the chief on the bridge if anything happened


reporting as ordered sir
what
you ordered me to report to the bridge sir
i did no such thing i want you down in the engine room just in case we need to move out of here
attention all decks all divisions effective immediately i have handed over control of this vessel to acting captain wesley crusher
acting captain
thank you captain picard thank you and with that order dawns a brave new day for the enterprise
captains log stardate  the strange contaminant that led to the deaths of the tsiolkovsky crew is now aboard the enterprise and our engineering section has been commandeered by young wesley crusher

and henceforth a dessert course shall precede and follow every meal including breakfast
hurray for the acting captain

never got as far as sickbay wes i feel too good for that

incredible how did you do that
hooked my model tractor beam into ships power now its a repulser beam too want in
swear to be faithful to you captain


number one macdougal get that boy out of engineering

sir im getting very strange reports from all decks
such as
such as the ships training division ordering all officers to attend a lecture on metaphysics
metaphysics
confirmed sir and there was a rather peculiar limerick being delivered by someone in the shuttlecraft bay i am not sure i understand it there was a young lady from venus whose body was shaped like
captain to security come in
did i say something wrong
i dont understand their humour either
yeah captain
where is my security chief get me lieutenant yar
keep your britches on
 captain picard
lieutenant where are you
im in my quarters and im pretty busy right at the moment jeanluc
all right lieutenant you just stay right there data please go to lieutenant yar and take her down to sickbay
yes sir

captain to security i want all your senior supervisors to report to the bridge immediately


lieutenant yar
here data you wanted me

captain picard ordered me to escort you to sickbay lieutenant
did he say when
i am sure he meant now so you need time to get into uniform
but i got out of uniform for you data do you know how old i was when i was abandoned
chronological age no i am afraid i am not familiar with
five five years old but i survived i learned how to stay alive how to avoid the rape gangs i was fifteen before i escaped
i am sorry i did not know
and what i want now is gentleness and joy and love from you data you are fully functional arent you
of course but
how fully
in every way of course i am programmed in multiple techniques a broad variety of pleasuring
oh you jewel thats exactly what i hoped


what have you learned number one
captain the ships engines are cut off from the bridge the assistant chief engineer pulled out the isolinear optical chips from command all engines are offline wesley has hooked some kind of tractor beam to ships power and he has it aimed at the door we cant get past to get at the computer

can you short out the power

yes i can but its going to take some time

do it

bill riker deanna what
so many minds on this ship all free released
deanna

i can feel them all what they want what they feel its a side of humans ive never felt before
come on im getting you to sickbay

wouldnt you rather be alone with me with me in your mind

 the medical records we found say this works almost instantly
its not fair doc ive never seen a rainbow sunset sunrise this is going to help me help me see like you

doctor crusher

deanna needs your help
the formula from the old enterprise didnt work
what
this watercarbon complex may induce the same symptoms but somehow its different maybe its mutated but ive got to isolate it in order to analyse it
we dont have that kind of time
you brought deanna in
shes infected with
then you touched her oh god and you touched me wait ive got to quarantine you
if i dont get the command computer back online soon none of this whatever this is wont matter well all be dead
captains log supplemental it is no longer an inconvenient childish prank young wesley crusher admittedly a victim of the tsiolkovsky infection is now in control of my starship

wes this is captain picard do you see me
yes sir
you will now return control of this vessel to the bridge where it belongs at once
im sorry sir why dont you just tell me what you want done and ill do it
because ship captains control their own vessels young man
but sir you dont do it yourself you give the orders but someone else does it whats wrong with giving me the orders to do it
captain getting unusual readings now from the dwarf star
stand by a moment on that wesley wes are you aware that youre acting strangely that a kind of infection was brought over from the tsiolkovsky which acts like intoxication
are you saying thats why i feel so so hot so strange
thats a very adult bit of reasoning wes
so you mean im drunk i feel strange but also good
because because youve lost the capacity for selfjudgment now alcohol does this wesley but this contaminant weve brought back from the tsiolkovsky does it even more so
what would you do if you got your ship back
oh its very important i do wesley because i must immediately lock a tractor beam onto the tsiolkovsky then tow it out of
tractor beams are my specialty skipper ill contact you when thats done wesley out
wesley wesley

conn where are you headed
sir the star its beginning to collapse
what the hell is happening in engineering


lock on lock on tsiolkovsky
wheres that sonic driver
its over there okay lets see if this cuts out his tractor beam power  oh come on


oh no i must find the answer ive got to find the answer

captain tractor beam we just locked onto the tsiolkovsky
captain to wesley wesley crusher come in

ah data at least youre functioning
fully captain
data intoxication is a human condition your mind is different its not the same as
we are more alike than unlike my dear captain i have pores humans have pores i have fingerprints humans have fingerprints my chemical nutrients are like your blood if you prick me do i not leak

doctor
captain can i see you in your ready room its a private matter no actually its an urgent one
but damn it


now doctor
i believe im infected myself captain
do you know what the infection is come on quickly
sorry it is definitely like alcohol intoxication the same lack of good judgment for example right now i find you extremely extremely of course we havent time for that sort of thing
what sort of thing
oh god would i love to show you
doctor there must be a cure some formula similar to the old one
damn it damn it captain my dear captain

you owe me something you do realise that dont you im a woman i havent the comfort of a husband a man
not now doctor please


bridge to riker urgent

riker here
sir

sir regret to inform you that the captain appears to be infected and data

thank you lieutenant im on my way youll have to handle this
are you saying youre going to handle that


what were seeing sir is a huge chunk of the stars surface blown away heading for us
take us
are you alright sir
worf you know what to do take us er
take us out of here
right
controls are still offline sir
override
same result sir

wes come in please

wesley crusher this is riker come in

this is urgent come in please

engineering urgent we must have ships power
those are control chips bridge from engineering

the star is still collapsing were directly in the path of

i cant help you bridge someone here has yanked out all the control chips
it was an adult who did it

sir i estimate fourteen minutes until that mass gets here
no way sir i cannot replace these chips in fourteen minutes two hours three

maybe
data could assemble them back faster

what whats that whats that wesley

well theyre just simple isolinear chips sir to data anyway he can shuffle them like cards

come on data hurry
ships log first officer riker enterprise will be destroyed unless it can be moved out of the path of the star material hurtling toward us our only hope is for lieutenant commander data in the time we have left to regain his senses and reconnect engine power to the bridge

nice to see you wesley
hi mister data
no time for courtesy get the damned control chips back in place in the correct order now
its like a game how fast can you do it
ah a game

i think i can switch this to main viewer sir

data weve got eight or nine minutes at most can you finish by then
no this will take slightly more time than we have sir

damn it no i cant afford to get this


beverly
yes jeanluc
you will address me as captain
captain well then my dear captain you will address me as chief medical officer or doctor
i will thats true i started off calling you beverly and of course naturally you im still not thinking straight
likewise where the hell was i headed
if thats something you were going to test
yes on geordi come here

see how i reversed the fields on this commander i made it into a repulser beam
if we just had one minute more sir
if this were a hundred times more powerful than it is why not try it with the real thing why not reverse fields on this maam if we just need an extra minute
it would take weeks of laying out new circuits
why not just see it in your head come off the main lead split off at the force activator then then if i could just think straight about this

i made this a broader based remedy i hope but its still close to the formula from the old enterprise records
decades ago light years away
but almost exactly the same conditions as here
wow what was in that doctor my heads beginning to clear
come here  here take this to engineering ill make up more hypos for the others
okay bev


were not going to make it captain if we had just a minute or so
then reversing power leads back through the force activator repulser beam hard against tsiolkovsky dont you see its giving us a push off the extra time we need
were pushing away

bridge engage engines



captain  something seemed to move us aside at the last minute
do we owe our thanks to commander data sir
yes and wesley may have given us a few seconds too
did he say wesley the boy
he said wesley

its only fair to mention wesley in a log entry sir
fairs fair and lets credit his science teacher too



congratulations sir
to many people

data im only going to tell you this just once it never happened
i put it to you all i think we shall end up with a fine crew if we avoid temptation so number one lets go to our next job
aye sir helm prepare for warp three heading two hundred and ninety four mark thirty seven
warp three heading two hundred and ninety four mark thirty seven sir
engage
code of honour

captains log stardate  our location planet ligon two source of a rare vaccine needed on federation planet styris four starfleet has instructed me to engage in a friendly visit and open treaty negotiations to acquire this medicinal substance

standard orbit sir
lieutenant yar is calling from cargo bay one sir standing by to beam ligonian welcoming party aboard
on our way you have the helm mister data

cargo one this should be an interesting experience
agreed not only are they closely humanoid but their history has remarkable similarities to ours
a highly structured society and theyre exceedingly proud

theyve insisted on using their own transporter device sir
its their way lieutenant do they have our coordinates
they have sir precisely and theyre standing by for your signal
this is captain picard aboard the starfleet vessel enterprise please do us the honour of visiting our vessel

i am lutan
captain jeanluc picard welcome aboard these are my officers my second in command commander william riker ships counsellor deanna troi and my security officer lieutenant natasha yar
a woman your chief of security
yes lutan that is her expertise
i am honoured to meet your officers this is my secondary hagon a sample of the vaccine

my duty lutan im sorry but im required to
out of my way woman

how interesting may we prove as surprising to you
if i may suggest sir no apology in their view it would weaken us
nothing concealed captain would you care to accept it
unless you care to examine it further
absolutely not this vaccine sample is a gift of life and we are honoured at receiving it would you do us the additional honour of now letting us entertain you lutan yes yes please prepare it we shall join you shortly

i ask forgiveness
they are strange alien beings you bear no fault
but the female
may be exactly what i have needed


lutan we are aware of many of your planets achievements and its unique similarity to an ancient earth culture we all admire on behalf of the federation therefore i would like to present this token of our gratitude and friendship from chinas sung dynasty fourteenth century
thirteenth century sir
ah yes indeed
a most thoughtful gift we are pleased we of ligon have been apprehensive about strangers we are not technologically advanced as you yet we possess something you do not a vaccine which has been found to be an effective antidote to your dreaded anchilles fever if you respect our customs and if we see that respect we will be friends and we will make the antidote available to all who need it
if you require respect from us i am sure that you will see it
surrounded by such friendship i feel no need for my guards i will return shortly prepare to transport me then

if there is something else any further courtesy
would it possible to see one of your wondrous holodecks we have heard how they are used to train your officers
and used for many other things too commander riker perhaps you and counsellor troi will demonstrate
would it be possible for lieutenant yar to do so captain some demonstration of defence training
weve noticed youre intrigued with her having security responsibilities but these things are not at all unusual with us
with us it is the duty of women only to own the land and the duty of men to protect and rule it
much the same has happened in human history too
id like to do it sir as a sign of respect perhaps
very well
this way please


aikido one  it wont move until my actions activate it
you can create people without a soul
its not a real person lutan it has no life everything it does is controlled by computer who am i do you hear me

but it will feel real when it hits you

a force like that cannot possibly come from an image lutan
then you will show me hagon

thank you lieutenant how very enlightening
aikido vanish i could create two even three but really one is enough as you fight with it it learns and before long it knows exactly how to defeat you
even the extraordinary lieutenant yar
it forces us to keep improving
your skill impresses me i like you

farewell my new friends of the noble enterprise
understanding has made friends of many different people weve had a good beginning lutan
may i also extend a personal farewell to lieutenant yar in your federation terms

picard to bridge red alert

 shields up photon torpedoes activated sir
what comm contact have we had with them
with their orbital control station sir
make contact there and on all hailing frequencies this is the enterprise to lutan and the ligonian government you have committed an unfriendly act we insist that you reply immediately
photon torpedoes ready sir
set them for a display blast a thousand metres short of the planets surface
set
fire
do we know the source of their transporter beam
our own transporter people have tried to trace it sir but to no effect
it reads similar to early starfleet efforts but uses the heglenian shift to convert matter and energy in different  which is actually not important at this time
this is captain picard of the enterprise with a message to lutan whom i have so far acknowledged as a friend but you have now committed what our laws regard as an attack upon us since you have visited our vessel you most certainly know the power of it we insist that you reply to this message opinion counsellor will they injure lieutenant yar
i believe not sir they seem mainly curious in the case of lutan however i did feel other needs
what kind of needs
some sexual attraction from all the males lieutenant yar is physically very attractive but with lutan i felt something else something more like avarice or ambition

if i may sir one of the things about them in the briefing studies was their respect for patience
strongly emphasized and you can see it in the precise ritualistic way they do things im worried about lieutenant yar too sir but maybe we should sit and wait them out
stardate  i am concerned over a full day of waiting with no response from lutan we are now testing whether they are aware of our sensors probing them so far we believe we have pinpointed lutans government compound

the vaccine sir
yes doctor
the vaccine im a physician ive seen death but not on the scale this could mean
you were testing if you can replicate the vaccine
and we cant the sample works fine when used as an injection but it becomes unstable when we try to replicate it you must get the vaccine from the planet captain as much as you can immediately
im aware of that doctor
youve never had to watch a patient die from this disease
thats true but i have seen my share of death
damn where are the calluses we doctors are supposed to grow over our feelings
perhaps the good ones never get them
may i speak about my son wesley
what oh yes alright
he seems quite interested in starship operations and speaking as a mother of course he seems quite knowledgeable
well yes speaking as a mother
hes on the turbolift youll remember you ordered him to stay off of the bridge

wesley
i havent stepped one foot on your bridge captain
its all right sir ill see that he leaves immediately
no
no
why dont you sit at ops next to lieutenant la forge
sir
sir
is the whole ship deaf sit down over there young man temporarily
captain we have more information from the briefing studies on ligon
excuse me doctor crusher some of this may interest you lets hear the analysis
it is a highly structured society in which people live by strict codes of honour for example what lutan did is similar to what certain american indians once did called counting coup thats from an obscure language called french counting coup
mister data the french language for centuries on earth represented civilisation
indeed but surely sir
i suggest you drop it mister data
yes sir counting coup could be as simple as touching an enemy with a stick in battle or taking something from him and escaping it was considered extremely heroic
and under these circumstances lutan considers himself heroic risking literally everything in the face of our superior power
and it fits lutans personality profile as well he has an abnormally high need for achievement self image to him is a function of what he thinks hes achieved those who set their standards too high can kill to meet them
why tasha
as a starfleet security officer she may have represented his riskiest prize
transmission from the planet surface sir main viewer on
well lutan what do you want
you will display your image please
what is required is an image of lieutenant yar well and
are you making demands captain
sir according to the ligon code of honour lutan has done what he set out to do achieve recognition for being daring and bold
weve studied this in some depth now sir the proper thing for you to do now is to ask to get tasha back
ask for her
politely captain
and now lutan you have boldly taken lieutenant yar from us and we ask that you now please return her
then come visit us captain and we will return her to you

commander
commander thats quite formal
so is this request sir we believe it would be preferable if the captain led this away party
agreed sir their customs concerning guests make it much preferable
and im very much against that idea lutan is clearly a liar and devious counsellor troi has admitted she believes hes capable of killing it is my duty to keep the captain from danger sir
except that ligonian custom makes it clear that a visiting leader becomes an honoured guest not us not second in command him
and the custom requires that lutan should die rather than violate that
yes it seems reasonable put that way but i warn you if you get hurt ill put you on report captain


welcome to my centreplace captain picard consider yourselves my honoured guests
every hospitality will be accorded you
this is my first one yareena
lutan is a fortunate man youve met counsellor troi
yes as on your vessel you have only to name whatever courtesy we can provide
then sir the courtesy of seeing lieutenant yar
lieutenant yar will be returned to you tonight at a banquet i have arranged in your honour
id like to see her now
bring lieutenant yar i find it odd captain that a man of your experience has such difficulty in understanding ordinary politeness
such as the politeness of saying please before abducting someone
the expression please is used only when requesting the person back
yours is a different world
with clear and simple ways deeply rooted in our culture if you are willing to ask for lieutenant yars return tonight in front of all honour will be satisfied
one can see the importance of honour here
honour is everything

have you been treated well lieutenant
fine captain but theyre showing some signs of wear
there isnt any need to be concerned captain shes being well cared for
my ships company and i are certain of your gentle wisdom in that
for a moment i thought i heard a threat implied but that would be foolishness
something to be carefully avoided i agree
the festivities for her return to you are in preparation shall we retire till then
until tonight lutan

lutan you have granted us hospitality and the safety of your centreplace the gifts you give us are rare and precious we thank you and now according with the customs of your ancestors whom we honour and respect i am here in peace to ask for the return of lieutenant yar
well spoken there are those among my equals in this gathering who were wary of my approaching the federation i am proud to have taken this first step towards a treaty and proud that we have something of great value to offer you a priceless lifegiving vaccine the abduction i have done according to our custom for all to see your conduct in this matter has been beyond exemplary captain picard but now that the moment has come i find i cannot part with her

you speak of a code of honour but what you are saying now according to our customs is called an act of war
this is not an act of war but of love i want lieutenant yar to become my first one
i challenge your right of supercedence
no woman has challenged supercedence for over two hundred years
the right is mine and i will have it natasha yar i challenge you a struggle to the death
no the challenge is unequivocally refused
then you shall have no treaty no vaccine and no lieutenant yar
ships log first officer riker reporting we have been informed of the challenge to lieutenant yar and are maintaining combat readiness round the clock we are probing lutans compound deeply with our sensors now still unnoticed

captain deanna
did you have any idea lieutenant that lutan was suddenly going to announce that he wanted you for his first one
no sir
tell me what you know about this
nothing sir
but it was a thrill lutan is such such a basic male image and having him say he wants you
yes of course it made me feel good when he troi im your friend and you tricked me
only so youd think about it completely and clearly
were all being manipulated lieutenant myself most of all
how simple all this would be without the prime directive
that thought had passed through my mind counsellor

what is this message from starbase fourteen
its showing the infection rates percentage illness increases the plague on styris four has flared up out of control
theyre estimating deaths in the millions sir
captain picard come in

i know i can win not that id take her life of course but id be glad to embarrass her the idea of accusing me of taking

the plague
if anything even worse than wed heard
which means they desperately need the vaccine sir and i know i can win this challenge
you have nothing to prove anything here lieutenant
but the vaccine is important in this case sir
counsellor youre the last person id expect to argue in favour of accepting the challenge
betazoid blood is also practical captain the odds are very good shed defeat lutans wife easily and you would win all the bargaining points you need
the odds are
you have pointed out yourself we are all at risk every day of every mission
i want some explanations from lutan

lutan why are you so obsessed with this lieutenant yar surely yareena is more desirable certainly she can offer you much more she owns many things many lands

its a great pity you began by abducting my security officer lutan because i should tell you i do admire the hospitality you offer here
i am in the grip of forces you do not understand
some of it i do understand she is a rather lovely female
you surprise me captain what do you know of needs and feelings
nothing well almost nothing in my position of ships captain
i see
but it puzzles me if you feel that way for tasha why have you challenged her to a fight to the death
not i yareena i am merely a spectator
ah but you are also a man of great importance and wealth
great importance perhaps but he does 
ah i see you too understand the proper value of women
we understand they are highly pleasant things but after all unimportant except for the land they own
you are a truly clever person lutan you stand to lose nothing either way the challenge goes
a code of honour protects one captain like a magic cloak
i will order lieutenant yar to fight and may your cloak bring you all you deserve


come in
why that razor my friend why not the one i adjusted to perfect efficiency
shaving is a human art form data technological perfection can shave too close
puzzling how can anything be too efficient
thousands of things are too efficient data at least for humans
we always come back to the human equation
exactly have you continued to work on it
constantly my friend particularly the humour a man goes to a store to buy some kidneys
oh no 
he says to the shopkeeper id like a pound of kiddillies please the shopkeeper says to him you mean kidneys dont you the man says i said kiddillies diddle i
its too old and you didnt tell it very well
how do you know when something is funny
its not explainable you just do
perhaps it is you geordi includling the kiddillies ive learned six hundred sixty two jokes and you have not
includling the kiddillies now see thats funny
it was not meant as a joke the tongue slipped
oh boy
riker to commander data lieutenant la forge report to the transporter room for away party duty

first officer to captain ready with the away personnel
lock in on this location
transporter locked in sir
energise

youve both seen the message about the plague
and how badly the vaccine is needed yes sir
we need to know as much as possible about ligonian armaments data especially important is an analysis of their combat capabilities geordi concentrate on their cutting edges wherever applicable durability composition weaknesses of material
aye sir
from any particular point of view sir
from the perspective of lieutenant yar using them in combat with lutans wife
most interesting could this be human joke number six hundred sixty three
negative data thats a captains order
which makes it important to know which of these weapons are to be used
and that wont be known until combat begins youre right data it does sound like a joke with the power of the enterprise we could overwhelm this place easily just take what we want
i may not understand human humour sir but i am a starfleet academy graduate
which means of course
understanding the prime directive sir
that is ironically what this is about by our standards the customs here their code of honour is the same kind of pompous strutting charades that endangered our own species a few centuries ago we evolved out of it because no one else imposed their own im sorry this is becoming a speech
youre the captain sir youre entitled
not entitled to ramble on about something everyone knows carry on
ships log commander william riker reporting continuing our appraisal of ligonian technology the captain has made it clear he wants lieutenant yar beamed immediately to safety if her life should become endangered and i fervently hope the rules of that contest make it possible

riker to transporter chief do we have our people on sensors yet
their general area sir visual on screen now as you see were still doing some fine tuning

ive agreed to this meeting but i see no point to it youve accepted the challenge and there is nothing further to say
i think you should know that there is no physical training anywhere that matches starfleet especially its security people
and you should know that even though these contests are rare we have a tradition of making ourselves capable of them
yareena my acceptance had nothing to do with lutan
it has everything to do with lutan lutan wants you to be his first one
impossible yareena i am a career starfleet officer
how could you not love him every woman loves him
i fight for the vaccine thats the truth
the truth is i will kill you if i can and believe me i can there is nothing else to say
in my world its a greater honour to refuse
you are on our world

captain im your counsellor you brought me with you to ligon to be of help
then help me please what is a way out of this
with the vaccine none

the weapons in that room captain are surprisingly flexible durable and deadly
and light as if they were made for women to use
some of them still have traces of blood and poison
poison
alkaloid base lethal
what about those lengths of metal in the yard outside
uncertain sir however joined together they would make a rectangle or square enclosing one hundred twenty one square metres if put end to end vertically they would make a pole forty four metres high or two of twenty two
thank you data
youre welcome sir

she wont budge she loves him without reservation and she thinks i love him too
most interesting do you
of course i dont data as troi pointed out to me im attracted to him but that is entirely different
riker to captain
go ahead riker were alone
were fine tuned enough to see your hosts gathering in the open area outside sir three of them are heading for your location
thank you number one lieutenant do you still feel that you want to go through with this challenge do you judge your condition good
i judge it excellent sir

your weapons lieutenant yar you may choose your size

tasha dont touch the spines theyre poisoned if youre not careful you could kill yourself
these i understand

first officers log supplemental captain picard faced with a critical need for a vaccine produced on this planet has permitted lieutenant natasha yar to engage in a fight to the death i have yet to understand his reasoning or his plan


care to lend a hand sit at ops


was i seen leaving
theyve got eyes only for the programme

captain picard wanted no risk of our communications being overheard you are to proceed now as he indicated
captains orders too
does the captain understand what you and geordi reported about those weapons theyre razor sharp splitsecond lethal
im here to brief you on what he plans


any last minute instructions sir
stay alive well hope to do the rest

i speak for lutan the rules are known let combat continue until there is a victor it will not be interrupted

combatants hold your positions return the weapon

careful yareena


move
were too late shes growing cold
sorry that clashes with my instructions

oh no no

exactly what do you find unfair lutan they fought to the death you saw the final blow you know the effects of your poison
but what of your lieutenant yar she is to become my first one now
i certainly wont stop her if she cares to claim that honour
remember you now have all yareenas lands and wealth now
at least all has not been lost
riker to captain
picard here
since youve fulfilled your agreement captain can we now beam the vaccine aboard
ah yes of course
no problem number one send down a medical team
and to complete our business here we are locked onto you
five to beam up energise
first officers log stardate  i am returning the conn to captain picard as we begin loading the vaccine supply aboard shortly we hope to signal mission complete


welcome back captain youre wanted in the lounge
this way gentlemen


she is not dead there was no death combat you violated our agreement there will be no treaty no vaccine
the challenge was carried out she died lutan
there was no challenge she lives
i am a physician and saw her die if you doubt this poison why dont you test it on yourself
lutan we can provide you with records of her death and how doctor crusher brought her back
and at the instant of death lutan a mating agreement dissolves
but this is witchcraft yareena to discard a mate in this manner
is less painful than the one you selected for me

yareena no
even as i battled hagon i heard you calling out for me
yareena be my first one
all my land and all my goods all i have is yours to rule

how so sad for you youve lost everything
i have my honour
its such a waste
do you want him
no there would be complications
then i will have you as my number two take your place accordingly
well as you see captain you may excel in technology but not in civilised behaviour


what wesley
young wesley hed been manning that station for me i forgot
well thanks again for manning one of our bridge stations wesley well see that you have another chance
yes sir

so whats the delay number one why arent we warping out of here
set course for styris four warp three
course laid in for styris four sir
engage
haven

captains log stardate  our destination the class m beta cassius planet known simply as haven it is a world so renowned for its peaceful beauty that some believe it to have mystical healing powers we will rest and relax all too briefly i fear

such a beautiful world legends say it has been known to mend souls and heal broken hearts
legends which are totally unsupported by fact captain
legends like that are the spice of the universe mister data because they have a way of sometimes coming true


lieutenant yar to commander riker your presence is requested in transporter room one
sorry ladies duty calls

you needed me lieutenant
yes sir theres an object of some kind beaming in from haven
what is it
were not sure
surface station approval coming in now lieutenant
all right lets bring it in

odd looking

whats going on

i hold a message for deanna troi lwaxana troi and the honourable miller family will soon arrive the momentous day is close at hand rejoice
no no
whats going on

jewels look at these jewels
theyre bonding gifts what you would call wedding presents
whos getting married
i am

i was certain it would never happen captain the years id spend on this mission the distance it has taken me away from home as you must have heard genetic bonding is a betazoid tradition steven miller was my fathers closest friend
your father was human deanna the millers are human
will you and your husband be staying with the ship counsellor
no sir
then ill just say congratulations for now deanna youll excuse me

bill more than anything else in the world anything you want to be a starship captain true
thats not all i want deanna
i can feel that i know you care within those limits did you hear what i said
every word this whole thing is still bizarre im sorry
come dance at my wedding
ill try

a message from planet haven counsellor they wish to beam the miller wedding party aboard


im jeanluc picard captain of the enterprise welcome aboard
quite some starship you have here captain look forward to this visit
you couldnt be
im deanna
deanna darling you probably dont even remember me
wyatt was absolutely right she is a beauty
im wyatt
isnt this simply beautiful i knew romance was still alive somewhere
id like you to have this its a chameleon rose it changes colour with the mood of its owner
its wonderful thank you when is my mother arriving
your mother is still down on the planet deanna
why
er is there a place for my parents to rest captain
well were not really tired son besides id like to see some of the ship
steven you know full well lwaxana troi isnt about to beam on aboard until we leave so
you can see your quarters now if you like will you show the millers to their accommodations please and i shall join you later

two more are ready to beam in sir
so be it wyatt seems a fine young man
yes he does but im not what he expected
i dont understand
neither do i but im definitely a surprise of some sort to him i should warn you sir my mother is a little eccentric

where is everyone oh i hate that
hello mother
dont say it think it use your mind not your mouth
hello mother
deanna shame what has this life done to you
no dont tell me youre the captain
of course your daughter has explained your telepathic ability
that wasnt telepathy it was just common sense who else would they send to greet me but the captain you may carry my luggage
mother
no no thats quite all right im indebted to your mother for the fine counsellor she

 this way


mother its quite inappropriate to ask the captain to
yes you do seem to be having difficulty a man your age must work to keep himself in shape
mother im not going another step like this a starship has its customs just as we do if youre my mothers valet then please valet
oh please dont let me keep up from doing your duty
i apologise for her behaviour do you realise youve embarrassed your captain
oh no
anything to avoid a quarrel on this occasion its amazing how that accent of yours reminds me of your father

your last valet tried so hard to rid me of it whatever happened to mister xelo
i was forced to terminate his employment xelo was strongly attracted to me his thoughts became truly pornographic

of course the thoughts of wyatts father toward me were almost as vulgar but he really doesnt have xelos
passenger accommodation
he doesnt really have xelos imagination
mother
between him and that womans inane chatter its a wonder i made it here at all how do you like the millers captain
im sure i find them perfectly pleasant
as for me i find it shocking how theyve changed in the years since my husband and i knew them of course its probably because ive grown beyond them you realise of course that with betazoids our ability to read the thoughts of others does see us grow much faster than the typical plodding human who
mother thats enough
so youre not totally out of practice good very good

we hope you find the room comfortable
yes the room is adequate small but adequate you will of course adjust the temperature to a civilised level
ill see what i can do and now if you will excuse me im sure the two of you have a lot to talk about
yes captain you may go

youve been slack little one allowed your mental powers to rust
only to avoid confusion mother humans constantly think one thing and say another
yes they do dont they poor dears our style of complete honesty frightens them
on that subject mother there is such a thing as too much honesty with humans
if theyd only say what they think instead of hiding it an entire shipload of such inconsistency could drive one insane
darling im terribly sorry about what happened here truly i am steven miller tracked me down and reminded me of the vows we had made
mother im having some trouble believing in those vows as once i did
deanna
but ill honour them of course im a betazoid
you may find wyatt an unusual person ive sensed remarkable depths in him

message coming in from haven captain
on screen

im valeda innis first electorine of haven captain picard
greetings electorine im picard
your presence honours us and your timing is fortuitous captain
in what way
an incoming vessel has bypassed our stargate violating our law it has refused any attempt at communication
are you saying you believe it to be hostile
failure to communicate is inherently hostile we have no defensive capabilities here and our treaty with the federation specifies your obligations in that matter
agreed but lets hope it doesnt become a defence matter
of course captain but im very happy we have you here

come in
i wanted to apologise for my mothers behaviour
your mothers honest i respect that
yes but she never lets up
ill admit her honesty is a bit persistent
i never heard it described better but it is a betazoid trait ill try to be only half as annoying
lets see what can i tell you about myself im a medical doctor for whatever thats worth
doctor
if youre picking up my thoughts youd know you can do that cant you
sometimes this must be what mother felt about you i believe we could read each other eventually
can i take that as a compliment
absolutely i only ever felt this well with someone whos on this ship
oh do i have competition
no what he wants most is to captain a starship
what i want is to cure people
well im a practicing psychologist maybe we can work in concert we are going to be together a long time
yes that is the point of marriage i suppose
i really thought youd tell me you were an artist i just felt your mind very much on these they are your work arent they
i can see itll be very hard to keep secrets from you
this is why you were surprised when you first saw me this woman you thought that i would be this woman
i have seen this face ever since i was a boy when i closed my eyes at night i could hear her whispering my name and knowing you were betazoid i just assumed it was you projecting yourself into my mind
im sorry im not what you hoped for
no please dont mistake a childish fantasy for disappointment you are so beautiful i feel honoured
youve no idea who she is
it doesnt really matter now
captains personal log i trust my concern over the problems of ships counsellor troi are not based merely on losing a highly valuable crew member but it seems to me that she is trapped by a custom of her home world which the facts of the twentyfourth century life have made unwise and unworkable i wish i could intervene

on the viewer captain unidentified vessel travelling subwarp speed bearing two three five point seven
subwarp its several hours away then lets take a look at it enlarge to maximum
increasing magnification sir
mister data is that the trouble i believe it is
if you mean a tarellian vessel sir it is
i thought the tarellians were all dead what are the poor devils doing here
picard to sickbay doctor crusher to bridge urgent they must not be permitted them to destroy us or the planet
captains log supplemental it has been believed the tarellian race was extinct an assumption contradicted now by the sight of one of their vessels approaching haven

the fact that its travelling at its present velocity suggests a possible answer
a damaged vessel sir that could explain it
if it were unable to reach warp speed it would have taken all these years to get here
go on with your briefing mister data
tarella was class m much like your earth with similar humanoid life forms unfortunately they faced the old story of hatred out powering intelligence
there were hostilities
between the inhabitants of their two land masses resulting in one group unleashing a deadly biological weapon on the other
and in the end the other became infected as well makes one question the sanity of humanoid forms
can you identify the origin of the infection doctor
the tarellians had reached earths late twentieth century level of knowledge thats all you need if youre a damned fool a deadly infectious virus which at that modest level of knowledge is not difficult to grow
we learned the rest of the story in security training some tarellians made it to other worlds only to die along with the populations they infected
its pretty well covered in academy training now captain many of them tried to avoid other civilised worlds as they escaped only to be hunted down and destroyed anyway
and it was believed that the last tarellian vessel was destroyed eight years ago by the alcyones
yes sir
exactly when will they reach haven
exactly thirteen hours nine minutes twenty two seconds three hundred fifty
thank you which creates a very difficult problem for the enterprise our treaty requires us to protect haven and federation policy requires that we assist life forms in need which must include the tarellians ill want you to help me find some answers thank you however there will be ample time for your second assignment voluntary of course the prejoining announcement of counsellor deanna troi

and wyatt miller

weve talked it over captain and the ceremony will be tomorrow if you agree and captain would it be possible for you to perform the ceremony
well yes of course if all parties request it
all parties do not request it its simply out of the question im sorry captain but unfortunately you are not practiced in the ways of betazed joining
no thats quite true
therefore you are totally unqualified
he is qualified to lead a traditional earth ceremony which is what this will be
i thought you had no sense of humour earth wedding ridiculous
my family and i are living on earth now
so thats why you want that backward ritual terrible captain to see a woman go downhill like this
mother
downhill
the matter is settled mister homn will conduct the joining
but homn cant even talk
no matter he is highly adept in the acts of sign language the matter is closed
who are you to tell us what we should do
your ignorance is astonishing i am lwaxana troi daughter of the fifth house holder of the sacred chalice of rixx heir to the holy rings of betazed who are you
ladies and gentlemen it is a starfleet tradition that at social gatherings disputes are not permitted i hereby declare therefore all disagreements resolved

a toast to the young couple and their families
and
and may this union be a productive one


considering the rate at which you imbibe sir is your lineage at all mixed with human

is it true captain that theres a tarellian ship headed for haven

yes it is true
thats amazing ive read everything i could about them biological virus analysis was a favourite subject at medical school
in which case id very much like to confer with you im pleased to have a medical colleague aboard
yes maam doctor would it be possible to prepare some medical needs geared toward the tarellians probable needs we could beam it over without any fear of infection
what do you think doctor
its a very considerate idea our sickbay is at your disposal doctor
thank you
mister data
sir
youre circling the room like a buzzard
perhaps being human yourself sir you do not find them as intriguing as i
must he do that
as you well know it is the betazed way of giving thanks for the food we eat
you giving thanks besides you never did this before
i do it now unlike some people i am in growth

victoria ive forgotten whether you enjoy pets or not
love them of course
good

gently gently poor baby did she hurt you
captain if youll excuse me id like to spend some time considering the tarellian situation
yes of course
ladies and gentlemen

mrs troi im very interested in the betazed ceremony you mentioned could you tell us more
why id be delighted commander its an ancient ceremony widely regarded as the most beautiful in the universe after the young couple have removed their clothing
the bride and groom go naked
all guests must go unclothed it honours the act of love being celebrated oh you neednt worry too much dear your bodys not that bad besides your husband quite likes the idea of seeing me unclothed
steven
you did know hes attracted to me didnt you
untrue i dont
stop this petty bickering all of you especially you mother

could you please continue the petty bickering i find it most intriguing


may i join you
i will miss you deanna
im no longer imzadi to you
you taught me that word means my beloved
and the human heart is too small to permit that feeling now
have you discussed this with wyatt i think you should its also damned unfair to me
i understand i should have realised humans young human males particularly have difficulty separating platonic love and physical love
the problem is imzadi i couldnt not now call it an old earth tradition habit of the beasts whatever
hello you two
we were just talking about you wyatt
this is incredible
yes and in that discussion i
actually bill was concerned that you might be upset that i care deeply for him too
oh youre the one who wants to be a starship captain yes ive heard that bonding or marriage would complicate things in that case to each his own good luck with that ambition and i very much respected what you did tonight
all i did was lose my temper
if youll excuse me
of course running all this is a big job

in fact you shamed them into compromise so theyve decided that the joining will be half betazed half earth the captain will do the ceremony and mister homn will be my best man
and well take our clothes half off
some of us still go naked you do i do your mother my father but not my mother or the guests
captain picard will be very relieved how did you manage it
your mother relented and i just caught my father practicing naked in front of his mirror and so a question i should have asked before deanna do you really want to go through with this
yes i want to
im a very lucky man

captains log supplemental all attempts at warning off the tarellian ship have failed they still refuse to communicate and i am growing concerned

how can you be certain theyre receiving us
because our sensors are showing a responder echo sir on the frequency they once used
we have a message sir coming in from haven
on viewer
captain the plague ship is approaching transport range
we are aware of that electorine
do you realise that they can turn this lovely world of ours into a graveyard please please take action now before its too late
we recognise your situation
please destroy them now
we will not fire on them electorine
you must

im certain i could disable their ship with a phaser burst captain
and then lieutenant
theyre within transporter range sir
then we cant delay any longer ready the tractor beam lieutenant yar target the ship activate on my command
tractor beam ready
engage
got them sir
do we have them securely lieutenant can they beam out to the planet
negative sir they cant leave that ship
i know they can receive us captain at this distance they can respond with running lights if necessary
unless they have all died their ship could have been brought in by automation
captain

its the woman in wyatts drawings
captains log stardate  orbiting haven with the tarellian vessel locked in our tractor beam question what strange of circumstances has caused a woman out of someones imagination to appear on the plague ship

enterprise to tarellian vessel are you receiving us

my name is wrenn and before i enquire why your tractor beam has trapped us here is there one aboard your vessel named wyatt

captain i dont understand
its astounding ariana was right he is here daughter
wyatt youve come just as you promised
how could i be so accurate except for the dream images ive never seen her
sir our concern is with the threat your vessel poses to the planet below if youre still carrying the infection which destroyed your world
oh we still carry it captain my daughter i all eight of us
eight
all of us that are left captain most of the rest passed on during the years that it took to reach haven
if youve come here because of the legend about planet haven miraculously healing the sick
we dont ask to make contact with those living below all we ask is to be on the edge of some sea some unpopulated island a faraway peninsula
this is not our planet sir but i will present your needs to those who do govern this world
present the fact we intend to die here captain and if we die while caged by your tractor beam so be it

oh wyatt how do you like my new hairstyle of course its going to look much better on me when im naked
mrs troi can i talk to you about something serious
oh but i am always serious dear boy only my pleasant nature makes it appear otherwise
please mrs troi
yes that was puzzling a woman out of another place who insists that she knows you
and
and whom youve dreamed of all these years
and i hoped that the way you handle thoughts
fascinating wyatt how easily your thoughts come through the answer to the puzzle of ariana and you is so simple its too simple for most humans to understand
too simple
of course its something they all know instinctively but go to great effort to reject or to build complicated superstitions about all life wyatt all consciousness is indissolvably bound together indeed its all part of the same thing
yes i have wondered if something like that
that werent so and no doubt so has ariana which helped the two of you to make contact wyatt tell me something seriously which of these would look best on me naked

wyatt are you feeling all right
just wedding nerves the supplies are ready ill take them to the transporter room
ill notify the captain theyre ready


look at your father wyatt he just cant wait to strip off his clothes for that barbaric ceremony
please take care of each other  you are beautiful but you looked best of all in the desert on the holodeck when we did this

you can put the supplies on the pad doctor crusher had me set the coordinates all we need is the captains order


captain someones transporting over to the tarellian ship
override
i cant sir its too late


hello wyatt we always thought you were a dream
youre not surprised did you know id beam over
once we saw you were real we knew you are a doctor
yes ive brought medicines and supplies
and i knew you would be this brave

how could you let this happen my son surrounded by those horrible lepers
mrs miller if i could have prevented this i would have
beam him back
he can never come back mrs miller
you may turn off your tractor beam captain we will not be going to haven we have what we really came for
wyatt
mother father forgive me but i must im going to try to continue the work to cure these people
and wyatt will do it ive believed that all along
i knew i was coming to haven to meet my destiny i thought it was to be with you deanna it was ariana who drew me here im sorry
wyatt im happy for you and for ariana too
youve done very well for a human wyatt
mother
captain my respects
and mine sir

goodbye

keep the chest youll have use for it some day

seems such a shame to waste the whole trip perhaps i should stay and be joined to a new mate
what
well the captains highly attracted to me but hes a little too old perhaps i should choose you

he has other obligations mother
oh very well its his loss mister homn
thank you for the drinks
try and remember your heritage little one  captain even xelo never had such thoughts about me you may energise

that was meant as a joke captain
i was not amused

take us out of here mister riker
aye sir warp two helm heading five seven mark three one nine
our destiny is elsewhere but im happy that yours is here with us counsellor
warp two heading five seven mark three one nine
engage
where no one has gone before

captains log stardate  we have rendezvoused with the uss fearless from which a starfleet propulsion expert and his assistant are beaming over to conduct tests on the enterprises warp drive engines they have completed similar adjustments on two other starfleet vessels

i dont understand your concern number one theyre not authorised to make any alterations in our engines and according to starfleets report they will simply test different ways of entering warp speed and different intermix formulas whats the harm in that
its the specs that kosinski sent us in my opinion sir theyre gibberish
gibberish
mister data would you explain
sir we put mister kosinskis specs into the computer and ran a controlled test on them there was no improvement in engine performance
then how do you explain starfleets report that the same tests on the uss ajax and on the fearless over there resulted in a measurable increase in propulsion
our engines are new sir top condition the tests on those older ships may have simply been to straighten out some engine inefficiency
bridge from transporter chief two from uss fearless are ready to beam over
stand by for commander riker chief hes on his way
aye sir
since youre concerned about these tests
yes sir captain if i may ill ask counsellor troi to look these visitors over
very good

welcome aboard mister kosinski im the first officer commander william riker and this is
where is the captain please
he is engaged in other duties sir
a ships engines should be a concern of the ships captain
they are sir which is why they have made the first officer directly responsible for an engines condition and performance guided of course by one of our chief engineers lieutenant commander argyle in this case
a pleasure sir i appreciated receiving the specs
to which you have no end of questions
aye i have
and you sir are listed as
as mister kosinskis assistant my actual name is unpronounceable by humans
youre from tau alpha c thats very distant
all approved and described in the starfleet communications now i would like to set up in the engine room immediately
ill have our chief engineer show you to his engine room
no need i know my way around starships

one thing that kosinski isnt hiding his bad disposition
agreed also hes arrogant overbearing selfimportant and very sure of himself and his ability
and the other one his assistant
hes the puzzle with most life forms i can usually feel something i may not be able to understand or interpret it but i feel something if only a presence with him nothing empty space its as though he isnt even here something about this concerns me i dont know what i cant point out a reason yet
stay concerned please the safety of the enterprise may be entrusted to these two


inform the bridge i shall begin the first test in precisely fifteen minutes why is that child here

hes working on a school project before you begin there are some questions first tell us how you arrived
in order to save myself time let me ask those questions for you you received the information which starfleet provided you fed it into your computer as precisely as humanly possible then you did a controlled test and then to your astonishment nothing happened so you said whats going on this doesnt work kosinskis a fraud you see i have had this conversation on other starfleet vessels before they didnt understand it why should you

surely youre not saying its unexplainable
im saying im not a teacher nor do i wish to become one i have neither the inclination nor the time
you have all the time you need
i dont think you understand this has already been approved by starfleet command
but it hasnt been approved by the chief engineer or by me
i didnt know that was necessary
now you do
perhaps i should speak to captain picard
if you like it wont change anything
how basic shall i be
ill leave that to you

would you get onto the auxiliary panel please

in order to save time my assistant is going to lay in my base formulas more rapidly than any human being possibly could including even myself so here then in the simplest possible terms what i do now this warp drive system was tuned only in the grossest possible sense at least according to my standards what i do is specific thank you well sufficient to say for now these symbols 
something troubles you with the way this is configured how about it now
yes but shouldnt these be connected here and here
now will it do what kosinski says it will
it has a chance it might work better this way yes

view with me if you will this screen as we consider the following now is this merely mechanics or is it nature that we deal with in all of this and what else than nature are the elementals of space and time you are trained in the system you go in a straight line competent yes and perhaps even innovative in a minimalist way but what i do here is not the end of the process it is the beginning so what do i do go back to the fearless which i left with a more efficient warp drive than i found or do you cast off your ignorance and allow me to continue
could anything hes proposing damage our system
how could it its meaningless
then we should let him try it
what do you mean let he him try it dont talk about me in the third person like im not standing right here
yes we might as well let him try it
oh yes we might as well let him try it you are too generous boy boy dont play with that


captain main engineering is ready to proceed
engineering this is the bridge its your call

do this one just like the last time nothing changes commander ill make my preliminary adjustments at warp one point five and complete them as we achieve warp four
engineering to bridge did you copy that

affirmative number one are you ready

we are
la forge set in warp one point five

warp one point five sir
engage

all right here we go

what are you doing


captain were passing warp ten

what is our velocity
its off the scale sir
reverse engines
captain no one has ever reversed engines at this velocity
because no one has gone this fast reverse engines

all stop
reading all stop sir
position
calculating it sir data what do you read there
malfunction i trust
position mister la forge
well sir according to these calculations weve not only left our own galaxy but passed through two others ending up on the far side of triangulum the galaxy known as m thirty three
thats not possible data what distance have we travelled
two million seven hundred thousand light years
i cant accept that
you must sir our comparisons show it to be completely accurate
and i calculate that at maximum warp sir it would take over three hundred years to get home
captains log stardate  this will be a rather unusual log entry assuming starfleet ever receives it as i have already informed my crew a phenomenal surge of power during a warp speed experiment has sent our starship hurtling out of our own galaxy past another taking us over two million seven hundred thousand light years in a few minutes

message on this has been transmitted to starfleet sir
which traveling subspace they should receive in fiftyone years ten months nine weeks sixteen days
mister data
sir

captain picard i presume
were still trying to determine what happened sir
the truth is captain i made a mistake a wonderful incredible mistake
just explain what brought us here
as the power grew i applied the energy asymptomatically i anticipated some tilling but it didnt occur now that was my error using the bessel functions at the beginning
what is he saying number one
to tell the truth sir it sounds to me like nonsense to me but considering
considering where we are we must assume it isnt

can i do something to help i can call my mother shes a doctor
no theres nothing she can do i need to rest ive been away too long
what happened to you is it part of what happened to the ship
please believe me i mean no harm to this vessel or those in it
is mister kosinski like he sounds a joke
no thats too cruel he has sensed some small part of it
that space and time and thought arent the separate things they appear to be i just thought the formula you were using said something like that
boy dont ever say that again and especially not at your age in a world thats not ready for such such dangerous nonsense

ive always suspected this rate of speed was possible of course but at this level no never were going to need new definitions new parameters
perhaps you could call it the kosinski scale
why not yes of course since im the one who has made the socalled warp barrier meaningless and captain this must be a special thrill for you
thrill
as an explorer in three centuries of space flight weve charted just eleven percent of our galaxy and then we accomplish this
yes but isnt the real point can you do it again can you get us home
of course i can ill just do what i did before coming riker
commander riker will join you in a moment

comment is invited counsellor
hes convinced hes right i have no doubt of that
captain can you allow a man who has made one mistake back into a position where he may make another
captain what are our options really i mean if this guy cant get us back who will
captain were here why not avail ourselves of this opportunity for study there is a giant protostar here in the process of forming no other vessel has been out this far
spoken like a true starfleet graduate it is tempting eh number one
aye sir it is but as they say sir youre the captain
i know that if kosinski can get us home starfleet can use his technique to bring back a pure science vessel to do even more number one tell kosinski prepare to get us out of here
aye sir

do you realise how many great advancements of mankind have been tied to speed this is a moment in history right here right now and your names will be forever linked with mine
excuse me commander riker i dont think he did this i think
not now wes
standing by number one
but sir when this all happened i was watching his assistant
im sure it was fascinating wesley i am looking forward to hearing about it but not right now
aye sir
 come on
hes too tired why dont you do it by yourself
yes why not
no i will help
as you wish

ive laid in the reciprocal course back captain

tell the captain i am ready first officer
were ready for you to engage captain
as before

begin at warp one point five
warp one point five sir

this isnt working


all stop
answering all stop captain
according to the instruments sir our speed never exceeded warp one point five
all stopped sir
yes but where is this place

where none have gone before
captains log stardate  instead of returning to our own galaxy the enterprise has gone forward to a place in the universe which is uncharted and unknown our present position puts us at over a billion light years from our galaxy

data you have the helm ill be in engineering


what is it
a klingon targ my pet from home but when i was a child
youre telling me thats a kittycat
yes i suppose you could call it that





you darling what are you doing here


now run this isnt a safe place at all



tasha whats wrong you look scared to death
i was i was this is crazy i was at the colony where i grew up being chased by a rape gang
are you all right well youre safe now



captain captain we need help
whats wrong
dont you see whats following us


ensign what are you doing



 you look tense jeanluc come and have a cup of tea
maman
ill make it good and strong the way you like it we will have a nice long talk
this cant be youve been
dead but im always with you you know that
yes ive felt that but why now suddenly
you mean out here at what you say us the end of the universe or do you see this as the beginning of it
we believe it the outer rim maman do you understand these things can you tell me where my ship is what is this place
captain you were reported headed for
just a moment number one

can i help you sir
no no lets help all of us  general quarters red alert


what is it captain why are we at general quarters
i had to get everyones attention it was the quickest way this is the captain this is not a drill it seems that in this place the world of the physical universe and the world of ideas is somehow intermixed what we think

also becomes a reality we must therefore i repeat must begin controlling our thoughts

we will give you more on this as our understanding increases the enterprise will stay at full alert until the crisis is over

 what did you do
it wasnt him it never was it was his assistant
what are you talking about
kosinski wasnt the one controlling the warp experiments
it was me
the equations he punched in were nonsense just as we thought
i honestly thought it was me i thought somehow somehow i was operating on his level
its also my fault captain i should have realised it wasnt kosinski
how could you how could any of us
wesley did
if you knew something why didnt you say so
he tried twice i didnt listen
hes unconscious why
im not certain yet
he phased sir
what does that mean
parts of him disappeared and then came back nobody else was paying attention to him the first time riker when we saw it this time he seemed to be struggling fighting it
hes dying
he mustnt hes the only one who can get us back
realistically it does not seem possible
captains log supplemental our position is unknown and our only chance of returning to the known universe is a dying alien who is generally humanoid but with a physiology sufficiently different from our own to create medical problems in caring for him


cause
i dont know my equipment doesnt register his kind of life signs i would have to guess exhaustion fatigue
is he going to be all right
what is the boy doing here
mom hes my friend
you may want him here before were done sir he seems to have developed some sort of special attachment to the boy
my name is wesley commander riker
he knows we all know will he live
im not sure
wake him
i recommend we let him come around in his own time
we dont have that luxury wake him
he could die and with him any chance we have
doctor wes we all have other friends aboard this ship too if we stay here much longer we may lose the ability to distinguish between thought and reality now regardless of the risk wake him now

do you recognise me im the captain and i need answers
ill do my best to provide
who are you or what
i am a traveller
traveller what is your destination
destination
yes what place are you trying to reach
ah place no there is no specific place i wish to go
then what is the purpose of your journey
curiosity
thats not an answer
i have certain abilities they give me an understanding of propulsion ive been trading this for passage on starfleet vessels
and allowing kosinski to take credit for what you did
it seemed the sensible way
until now
captain i seek only transportation in order to see and experience your reality i am no a threat to you your ship or your crew
he isnt captain i know he isnt
our reality and in order to satisfy this curiosity you have brought my ship and my crew into great risk
i have made some mistakes
some mistakes what mistakes could possibly explain these incredible explosions of velocity
i dont know if i can put this in terms youll understand
i believe there may be a warp speed that can get us beyond galaxy m thirty three but there is no velocity of any magnitude that can possibly bring us wherever this is is it true what our navigation sensors are telling us are we millions of light years away from where we were
well yes
well what got us here
thought
thought
you do understand dont you that thought is the basis of all reality the energy of thought to put it in your terms is very powerful
thats not an explanation
i have the ability to act like a lens which focuses thought
thats just so much nonsense youre asking us to believe in magic
well yes this could seem like magic to you
no no it actually makes sense to me only the power of thought could explain what has been happening especially out here
thought is the essence of where you are now you do understand the danger dont you
chaos what we think is what happens
it pains me i was so careless captain my intent was only to observe not to cause this you should not be here until your far far distant future certainly not until you have learned control
you are from a different time arent you
well no not exactly from another time although as you understand the concept yes perhaps that term fits as well as any
and you have this ability to travel
yes
and others of your kind have the same ability
yes
then why in all of our history is there no record of you or someone like you ever having visited us
what wonderful arrogance there is no record because we have not visited you before
why not
well up until now if youll forgive this youve been uninteresting its only now that your life form merits serious attention im sorry
whats happening
hes unconscious again
revive him
whatever you need from him youd better get it soon
if i may suggest sir that first leap out of our galaxy was as he said a mistake
unless he was distracted by something
and it weakened him in some way leading to the incredible leap out here
theory
do you have any facts that fit this can you get us back
wait captain not so fast we have an opportunity here for scientific discovery
and we report our observations how to whom  can you get us back
i will try
number one take him down to main engineering ill be on the bridge
no hes very weak traveller the captains right we must hurry but first i request a moment with the captain alone

strange how he seems to care for you
he will forget me in time which is as it should be its wesley i wanted to speak to you about
the boy
its best you do not repeat this to the others especially not to the mother whatever may happen it is imperative that it proceed naturally
i must get my ship back do we have time for this
oh yes he and a few like him are why i travel you have it in your power to encourage him without interfering
encourage him in what
how shall i explain are you familiar with the intricacies of what is called here music
somewhat
such musical genius i saw in one of your ships libraries one called mozart who as a small child wrote astonishing symphonies a genius who made music not only to be heard but seen and felt beyond the understanding the ability of others wesley is such a person not with music but with the equally lovely intricacies of time energy propulsion and the instruments of this vessel which allow all that to be played youre right i must hurry now but youre right in something else he is just a boy for now he should be encouraged but told none of this


were going to get back home take him to engineering
yes sir
ill be on the bridge
yes sir

put it out
how
think put the flame out in your thoughts

now get to your station and concentrate on your assignment
yes sir
captains log any time entry is meaningless we have no choice but to repeat the same warp experiment but wish one variation a principal part of this warp formula will be the thoughts of everyone aboard the enterprise we have no idea exactly how this works we understand only that the traveller makes use of this somehow it will be most important that those aboard avoid random thoughts that might change the reality of what were attempting to do

do you have any further advice counsellor
when you begin the attempt there will be stress and its only natural the crews concentration will shift
plus some genuine fear captain you cant notice whats happening outside without feeling some of that
all decks all stations

this is the captain speaking all decks i must have your full attention in a few moments as we attempt to warp back home it is vital absolutely vital that you centre your thoughts on your duty or on the welfare of the one called the traveller

think of giving him some of your strength now this is an order you must try to do this

and now attempt to concentrate completely on your duty of the moment or on the traveller on his well being

think of him as someone you care deeply about

all decks all stations battle stations

i will need kosinski back on the main computer
you need me
yes

helm set in warp one point five retroactive course
warp one point five retroactive two six one mark three one sir
bridge to engineering stand by
i feel such an abundance of well being on the ship it feels like quite wonderful
engineering to bridge were ready
on my order mister data mister la forge engage

its not happening its not enough

warp one point five sir which is what my instruments have read all along
and our position reads exactly what it was before this sleigh ride began sir
cease red alert
sleigh ride
or whatever you want to call it data i dont have a proper name for it

the travellers gone sir
gone
hes phased completely out of existence at least out of our existence
attention all decks this is to inform you that with your support the traveller has returned us to our galaxy however he has now left us wherever he has gone we wish him well have the boy sent to the bridge number one
wesley crusher report to the bridge on the double
our next assignment is on this heading
yes sir
mister data mister la forge increase to warp five same heading
warp five sir
on that same heading sir

ah wesley come on the bridge move
commander riker has told me how supportive you were in engineering well done at ease sit here in command
captain its not allowed your orders
oh thats true well i cant waive them again only commissioned officers
its quite all right sir i understand
please dont interrupt me wesley
im sorry sir
any commissioned rank even ensign
that would give him authorised access to the bridge
well then ill have to make him an acting ensign captains log stardate  for outstanding performance in the best of starfleet tradition wesley crusher is made acting ensign with the duties and privileges of that rank and whether that rank becomes permanent mister crusher depends on you at the earliest opportunity your entrance application for starfleet academy will be tendered until then you will learn this ship every operation every function commander riker a duty schedule for mister crusher heavy on study
aye sir
meanwhile you can sit here and learn something

sir shall i send for doctor crusher
why is someone ill or would you rather tell her about this wes
if you dont mind sir id like to sit here awhile ill tell her later

the last outpost

captains log stardate  we are in pursuit of a starship of ferengi design our mission is to intercept and recover a t energy converter which the ferengi stole from an unmanned monitor post on gamma tauri four a theft which automatic scanners recorded providing us with the long awaited opportunity to make close contact with a ferengi vessel if we succeed in this chase it will be starfleets first look at a life form which discounting rumour we know almost nothing about

there she is
enlarge what is their course
they are now angling through that solar system captain
identify
listed as delphi ardu sir eleven planets unexplored
stay with them la forge
aye sir
sensors read a power surge from their last manoeuvre captain
they are dropping to subwarp speed
reduce to impulse power
sensor record fluctuations in the energy readings from it captain
possibility a malfunction in their engines sir
breaks my heart
in visual range captain
fully enlarge

hello stranger
very impressive design
anything on that design data
nothing specific sir as you know ferengi technology is estimated to be generally equal to our own
but that does not mean identical however
correct sir we are no doubt advanced in some areas they in others
showing another power surge sir
they are firing on us
damage report
shields holding
mostly electromagnetic sir fusion generator and batteries down by thirty percent
our impulse engines are surging now
theyre firing again

deflector shield power weakening captain phasers ready photon torpedoes ready
do we return their fire sir
negative number one theyre just reacting to our close pursuit fall back a bit but stay with them
they are slowing too sir
they may be turning to fight
open hailing freq  why are we gaining on them dont anticipate
im not sir somethings wrong
sir something is dragging us forward
i read that too lieutenant yar what do your sensors show
not certain sir im getting very confusing readings
captain this shouldnt be our ships power systems are failing
deflector shield failing phasers going inoperative captain
captain something is completely immobilising us
immobilised by the damn ferengi
we need more information what the hell are they are using
obviously weve underestimated their technology captain
considerably it appears the ferengi have us right where they want us in their sights are you searching all frequencies any sign of any kind of messages
negative sir
weapons report lieutenant
i have phasers and torpedoes armed but i show insufficient power to fire them
engineering give me status on power recovery engineering come in why arent they answering la forge
sir
get me a full report from engineering
aye sir

its impossible they could be draining all power from all systems
counsellor
im sensing nothing from them captain which could mean they can shield their thoughts and emotions from others
it still makes it our move
sir they may know as little about us as we do about them
except that they know theyve got us in deep trouble
if so the question becomes how will they use that knowledge data do you have any information touching this on any file
none sir only hearsay and third hand reports most of which conflict
which reports do not conflict
that the ferengi are well the best description may be traders
what kind of traders
a comparison modern scholars have drawn from earth history likens the ferengi to the oceangoing yankee traders of eighteenth and nineteenth century america sir
from the history of my forebears yankee traders
who in this case sail the galaxy in search of mercantile and territorial opportunity
and are those scholars saying the ferengi may not unlike us
hardly sir i believe this analogy refers to the worst quality of capitalists the ferengi are believed to conduct their affairs of commerce on the ancient principle caveat emptor let the buyer beware
yankee traders i like the sound of that
well sir i doubt they wear red white and blue or look anything like uncle sam
engineering join la forge down below in engineering number one
aye sir
without warp capacity were just a floating target
uncle who
what have bright primary colours got to do with it
i understand the allusion colours representing countries at a time when they competed with each other red white and blue for the united states whereas the french more properly used the same colours in the order of blue white and red
and the german nation red black and gold the italians green white and red the british
thats enough data
it was you who
were discussing the ferengi i wish i had some clue as to what they will do next
given what is now happening to our ship sir their weapons could be vastly superior to ours
yes data that is a natural assumption engineering

bottom line la forge
its not good sir the ferengi forcefield that holds this ship compensates almost as fast as we can increase power
almost
well theres a point three hundred seventy two millisecond delay between use of our power and the neutralising counter force of the ferengi see we push and they push back in equal force sir
whats our acceleration delay between slowreverse impulse and top warp speed
thats point threehundred milliseconds theres  ah i see where youre going we shift down and then kick hard into warp nine yeah come back fighting whooey
can we do it geordi
ask me after its done sir  i want a slow reverse into drop off over five minutes well show them what this baby can do sir
give me everything youve got
aye aye sir

in a sudden abrupt power surge to high warp speed captain we may be able to break loose from that ferengi forcefield
i wonder what theyre thinking over there
theyre wondering what were going to do next
i say fight sir theres nothing shameful in falling before a superior enemy

and nothing shameful in a strategic retreat either
all systems ready captain and communication now restored to engineering
excellent la forge now lets er lets throw them off guard lieutenant yar open hailing frequencies
hailing frequencies open sir
at least we wont begin with weakness attention ferengi starship this is captain jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise in the name of the united federation of planets i demand you return the t energy converter you removed from gamma tauri four send that in all language forms
all language forms sir
sometimes riker the best way to win a fight is not to be there
yes sir he will triumph who knows when to fight and when not to fight
glad the academys still teaches the strategies of sun tzu this delay had better prove out laforge
point three hundred milliseconds sir
lets blast full power into warp nine ready
on your command captain
on a count of three stand by on phasers one set warp to nine two divert shield power to the main engines three

merde shields up
captain i think you had better see this
whats wrong
someone is reading every file every bit of information stored in the enterprise memory banks
they can do that
and more perhaps
captain if i may recommend with our attention on the ferengi vessel we have ignored the planet
data consult the charts on this planet see what weve got on it conference evaluation

so while we still have some power left it is time for difficult decisions opinions please
i say put all available power into a fullout combined phaser and photon torpedo salvo destroy their ability to sustain this forcefield sir
yes hit them hard and hit them fast
impractical and provocative even assuming that we have the power to sustain such a tactic
but captain isnt firing on us an act of war
the facts are the ferengis did fire at us but we were chasing them since then all theyve done is searched our computers trying to learn who and what we are
your point counsellor
lets talk to them
its been tried no response
but did we tell them anything they wanted to hear
la forge other opinions thank you for your advice

will i havent had your assessment
i believe weve covered every available alternatives captain are there other options that you want to analyse
the only one remaining is the one that needs no conversation the only one we must avoid
sir
the one that leads to total annihilation

open hailing frequencies
open sir
attention ferengi starship this is captain picard it is obvious that we are in a situation here which needs resolving and we are willing to do whatever is required whatever is necessary i would like i would request that you present your terms to us
captains log stardate  it is with a heavy heart that i have offered to meet whatever reasonable and necessary terms are demanded by the ferengi i fear for my people and my vessel in the event the unknown ferengi ask the unreasonable how can i oppose even unreasonable demands

its moving sir
we ask to surrender and now they fire on us
ready torpedoes sir we have enough power for a few of them
ready but hold on ready open hailing frequencies
hailing frequencies open sir
ferengi vessel we are awaiting your response
suggest first strike sir our shields now only have sixty three seconds of power left before lowering
if the ferengi ships sensors can read us sir they will be waiting until we are most vulnerable
im afraid i agree captain they have not responded
well wait a bit more number one
fifty seconds
patience patience
the quicker we can come to terms the better ncc d
who is speaking
i am tarr daimon of the ferengi you wish to discuss surrender captain picard
what i said daimon tarr is
unconditional surrender i warn you is totally unacceptable we will die to the last one of us before such dishonour
hailing frequencies closed sir
something has seized their ship too theyre in the same predicament as us  launch a sensor probe set it to search for the source of whatever this something is that is holding both ships go back to hailing frequency fast and i regret daimon tarr that i can no longer negotiate unless it is conducted visually
your complete message not received enterprise but visual communication is against our custom
and it is against starfleet orders to accept a surrender otherwise do you withdraw your surrender
you give us no choice enterprise may we have a visual on you as well
agreed daimon tarr you should be able to view us now are we on your screen

yes the ugliness of the human was not an exaggeration i do not know how your twisted alien culture has paralysed our vessel but i concede your enterprise is superior we will return your worthless t device and we offer the life of our second officers as required by the ferengi code
 fortunately starfleet has no such rules involving our second officers
is this to your satisfaction picard captain
your offer may be inadequate but i will discuss it with my staff stand by for further communications


matthew pola you know this area is off limits come on come on  boys will be boys captain
lieutenant have you launched the probe
aye sir we should getting those readings soon
well if were not holding the ferengi and theyre not holding us who the hell is
the probe will give us some of those answers sir

data you were going to show us something
as requested captain library computer information on this planet it has been charted only from long range scans it is class m but shows no indications of life forms sentient or otherwise however you may find this of interest resolving it into our language

the centre of a huge space federation a population of trillions
trillions ive never heard the word tkon before
understandable it has been extinct six hundred thousand of our  of our years these planets were once outposts of that empire
data what are you doing
apologies captain i seem to have reached an odd functional impasse i am stuck
then get unstuck and continue with the briefing
yes sir that is what i am trying to do sir but the solution eludes me
my hero

continue commander
intriguing it describes the empire as being highly advanced and powerful and capable of actually moving stars
stars whose planets are their defence system
correct sir outposts the planet below was possibly one of them
excuse the interruption captain but this may be worth it were now receiving a signal from the probe
well take it here

incredible
theres our mysterious something captain it is a forcefield of some kind
reaching up from the planet surface amazing power data what does the legend say about the end of the tkon empire
their sun went supernova sir
could this planet have escaped that
this planet may have been the most distant outpost sir but it shows no life form readings
we should take a look at it number one stand by with an away team
and if the ferengi also realise the forcefield emanates from the planet sir
thats a complication maybe we should ask them to join us in this
team up with the ferengi sir
weve been ordered to learn all we can about them do you know a better way
data

captains log supplemental in orbit of a mysterious planet whose unexplained forcefield has seized us with a power almost beyond imagination if there is a solution to this it almost certainly will involve cooperation from the ferengi

ships power drain is critical captain i must now shut down our shields to maintain life support systems
understood open hailing frequencies
hailing frequencies open sir
ferengi vessel from enterprise come in
your alien images again shock us
with regard to the surrender daimon tarr the facts are somewhat different
our own probe has already shown us your trickery human we withdraw our surrender
agreed perhaps you would agree to a more productive relationship
i prefer a more profitable one human
yankee trader
explain what means yankee traders
he heard that
he recognises your interest in profit or is that an incorrect assumption
we seek only what is equitable what do you seek why did you begin by attacking us
we did not attack you we gave chase in order to recover a federationowned energy device which
which we know is ours your barbarous federation placed it on one of our planets
on the contrary gamma tauri four is recognised by all civilised members of
the ferengi are not uncivilised human are you suggesting otherwise
all im saying is that you removed something which clearly did not belong to you
are you now calling us thieves
on the contrary i have no wish to discuss issues of property or of territory when our mutual problem remains like it or not we are both trapped by this energy draining forcefield from the planet
on that matter there can be no argument
i would like to propose a swap
and what is a swap
its a trade an exchange
yes trade human what do you offer
we will tell you what we know about the planet and in trade you will give us your information
ridiculous how will we know you will not withhold information
we must trust each other tarr
amusing human trust each other
i propose that we test this relationship by cooperating in a joint exploration of the planet surface
and what profit is in this picard captain
the profit daimon tarr of saving all our lives
we will agree no doubt foolishly but you are warned that any further trickery on your part will be met with no mercy
agreed if you care to join us we have a wellproven transporter device
we have a matterenergy device of our own we will beam a science team of three to whatever coordinates you propose
excellent we will transmit the information shortly enterprise out
hailing frequencies off
i would log that agreement as promising at least
i wonder captain im not usually one for distrust at first sight but this may be an exception
especially in view of the fact the image he transmitted sir was somehow distorted
i sensed the same thing captain hes hiding something
with this power drain we cant delay now id like some additional help in case we run into trouble can you spare worf
take him and be careful number one

with this power drain we may have trouble communicating with the enterprise sir
understood anything else
due to this forcefield there is presently no way to beam us back sir
you had to ask
understood energise


tasha data geordi worf anybody

data

what are you doing up there
most intriguing sir i assume a problem of inaccurately transmitted programme coordinates due to the force field around the ship sir are we alone sir
unfortunately lets find the others what do you make of these
crystalline mostly inert nothing to write home about
excuse me
slang sir i did use it correctly did i not
theyve got to be around here somewhere

whats that
what
that geordi

are you conscious
do i look conscious
what are you doing
im resting sir my foots stuck up there i materialized upside down above the planet surface
tricorders useless sir communications gone too fortunately you did not break any
data whos that

who are you

captains log supplemental it is now six hours since our away team beamed down to the planet surface on the enterprise our condition is rapidly worsening ordinarily with reserve power alone we could maintain life support for several months but the force holding has closed down all engines and is draining our reserve power too


its getting much much colder sir how far down is it likely to go
a lot even in orbital space itll get below minus two hundred degrees
we wont have to worry much past minus seventy or so
feels like that right now good thank you


if he moves kill him
letek has what weve done broken our agreement with their captain
we will accuse the humans of preparing to ambush us it will be our word against theirs and who is more trustworthy mordoc  it looks like gold tastes like gold
it is gold

accursed planet
its nothing compared to what our captain will do when he finds out youve broken our landing party agreement
what part of the agreement you appeared and attacked us are you one of their assassins
im commander william riker first officer of the uss enterprise you have a lot to learn

ive got this one
 careful commander theyre much stronger than

pygmy cretins
kill them
hideous monsters
no  good youve heard of phasers now over there
is this a female
a human female letek
yes it is true you work with females arm them and force them to wear clothing
sickening

ive diverted the reserve power to the family decks theyll last longest is there anything else we can do doctor wheres wesley
hes in our quarters i was tempted to give him a sedative
you shouldnt
i know but hes my son i love him
he has the right to meet death awake
is that a male perspective
rubbish


hold it right there stop stop
phasers on stun
already set

whats going on

what is this
i believe we can deduce that these crystalline tree shapes are actually energy collectors
along the same principle as that which is draining energy from our ships
but the ferengi weapons were working when we first arrived
which means something new has happened
im finally beginning to understand what my eyes have been showing me its patterns of force everywhere this entire planet has been turned into a power accumulator
and these
its the whole point of this place i can see the planets power emanating from commander

be you barbarians speak

who meets the challenge who will it be
 him
you have awakened portal six three do you petition to enter the empire
who asks the question
a guardian of the tkon empire

biped excellent
why should we petition to entry to an empire that no longer exists
why do you attempt deception the empire is forever
your empire fell prey to a supernova
we are forever
data please repeat the file
it is a matter of record portal in the age of makto the central star of the tkon empire destabilised and
there has never been an age of makto
in fact there have been many ages which have come and passed since makto
this is the age of bastu
im afraid not according to the tkon use of galactic motionary startime charts after bastu came cimi xora makto
enough absurdities
you must have been asleep portal for hundreds of thousands of our years
deception is the way of the human we ferengi will gladly make a petition
we invite your petition
speak
we wish to offer our services to serve the tkon empire at no profit return control of our starship to us and we will happily destroy the human criminals and their vessel which attacked us without provocation they came to loot your empire but we intercepted them
you are accused of deceit and treachery do you give yourself up for judgement
yes if you believe those accusations then you certainly should act on them
and there is even more we can prove that the humans are destroyers of legal commerce and that they selfishly withhold vital technology from backward worlds
and necessary defensive weapons too we ferengi now challenge this human madness
i admit we withheld modern technology from some worlds
you see they are demented their values are insane you cannot believe the business opportunities they have destroyed
proof of their barbarism they adorn themselves with gold a despicable use of a valuable metal and they shamelessly clothe their females
inviting others to unclothe them the very depth of perversion
paws off ferengi
no female human or ferengi can order mordoc around submit
just try it shorty
at ease lieutenant
and we still have more faults
they should add that starfleet has permitted several civilisations to fall we have at times allowed the strong and violent to overcome the weak
they admit their crimes hear them they admit the evil that they do
barbarian
yes you show wisdom
barbarians all but this one first in the fashion the empire has always challenged savages
no for battle come to me
no thats an order
you have a single chance for life one only what is the answer to my challenge i offer a thought he will triumph who knows when to fight and when not to fight you are being tested riker what is the answer
how do you know my name

ahhh you are facing fate with composure but what is the answer to my challenge
fear is the true enemy the only enemy

unlike these little ones who close their minds your mind holds interesting thoughts know your enemy and know yourself and you will always be victorious why that thought and who is this sun tzu you revere
an old chinese philosopher from ancient earth history
you must tell me more of this wisdom so much like our own
gladly but first our starship can you release it
it is released all power is restored


not a moment too soon jean i mean captain

i admit i had my doubts as your ships battled each other in overt acts of belligerence normally i would have destroyed all of you and your ships but something confused me
which was
first you wanted to murder each other then you were willing to help each other
what of our vessel we knew the same answer
the truth is i gave those words to this human
what of them shall i destroy them
then they would learn nothing
a most interesting conclusion but what if they will never learn riker
is this a test also
in life one is always tested
i find them very much as we were a several hundred years ago but possessing the technology they have now theyre very dangerous 
untrue we seek friendship with you
but we can hardly hate what we once were they may grow and learn
and learn ways to destroy you
our values require us to face that possibility what of you with your empire gone
the universe exists to me to create life i shall sleep until needed again


compliments lieutenant
thank you
lieutenant worf

youve done well
something to write home about
something to write home about data thats very human
the t energy converter has been beamed aboard and secured sir the ferengi complained bitterly but one final roar from portal convinced them
i commend your performance number one
one final request sir permission to beam a box of datas chinese finger puzzles over to the ferengi a thank you for all they tried to do
make it so
lonely among us

captains log stardate  we have orbited the two major planets of the beta renner system taking aboard delegates from those two worlds since achieving space flight their major life forms the anticans and the selay have become deadly enemies but both have also applied for admission into our federation we are to deliver these delegates to this sectors neutral conference planet called parliament in the hope their dispute can be resolved


im captain picard welcome aboard we hope your journey will be pleasant and comfortable arranging that will be my first officer commander riker
welcome aboard if youll follow me i will show you the accommodations that weve
 we can already smell the anticans they were taken aboard first
only because their world was the first on this heading to parliament
will our quarters be near the anticans
about one hundred metres apart
is that all right
no unsatisfactory
i believe we can accommodate your wishes well rearrange the suite assignments if youll follow me
and we must be upwind from the anticans
of course sir

neither seem like very promising federation candidates sir
even parliaments peacemakers may find this case a little difficult


but do you understand the basis of all this nonsense between them
no sir i didnt understand that kind of hostility even when i studied earth history
really oh yes well these life forms feel such passionate hatred matters of custom god concepts even strangely enough economic systems
sir my sensors are picking up an unusual energy object ahead
on screen
confirmed sir my sensors read nothing solid but considerable energy in changing patterns
also travelling at warp speed sir intriguing i can find no match with anything in our records sir
change course to make a close sensor pass we can then increase warp speed and reach parliament on schedule
aye sir


so worf why the interest in this its just routine maintenance on the sensor assemblies
simple geordi our captain wants his junior officers to learn learn learn
not just the junior ones okay you hold this relay offline while i adjust these sensor circuits
security to sensor maintenance
lieutenant la forge here

were making a close sensor pass on an unusual object geordi any problems
not at all lieutenant all equipment on line and functioning
sensors ready sir
life form reading
no life form reading sir
begin the pass

sir it is changing shape
any readings of matter there
negative captain energy only



worf la forge to sickbay we havd a medical emergency in sensor maintenance i repeat this is a medical emergency

what happened
i dont know he got hit by some sensor feedback maybe

you got it doc
i got it lieutenant worf can you hear what im saying lets get him up
okay come on big guy on your feet here we go thats it
 are you okay

he was just monitoring the sensor console when he jerked as though something hit him what my sensors showed was a glow just for a second i cant explain it
could your visor device have malfunctioned
i doubt it sir it seemed what i was seeing was something real


sorry to call you sir not strictly security its about the dietary requirements of the antican delegates
i thought that had been taken care of in advance tasha
so did we sir their live animals were beamed aboard we were going to preserve the meat for them but they say we must bring it to them alive
then do so lieutenant yar was confused we no longer enslave animals for food purposes
but we have seen humans eat meat
youve seen something as fresh and tasty as meat but inorganically materialised out of patterns used by our transporters
this is sickening its barbaric


hes reading normal now how did you manage that
yes normal
are you all right
yes perfectly both of us quite normal now

what where am i
dont you remember you were in the sensor maintenance room
i remember monitoring the sensor console what am i doing here
thats a story the doctor will tell you



obviously you feel its something we should look at more carefully
a mystery is only a mystery as long as it remains uninvestigated sir
i love a mystery data but this one will have to to wait until we deliver the delegates to their peace conference on parliament time and tide lieutenant la forge go to warp eight
warp eight sir

him mom youre back early
yes

physical sciences class were studying doctor channings theory on dilithium crystals
tell me about it
really you never seemed that interested in warp theory before doctor channing thinks its possible to force dilithium into even more useful crystals if as shown here matter and antimatter could be aligned even more efficiently
would that affect navigation
this is engineering not helm control
oh yes the helms located on the bridge

mom is something wrong


this is the helm
unless there have been some changes i dont know about
doctor crusher
you will wish to know lieutenant worf is much improved ready to return to duty
what was the diagnosis
a temporary mental aberration
doctor when such a diagnosis concerns a bridge officer i expect a better explanation
then i will first have to run some crosschecks on the library computer klingons are so unusual in their reactions arent they
use science station two doctor

intriguing doctor what does helm control have to do with medical crosschecks

why am i
is something wrong doctor
doctor are you all right
yes yes ill do my work in my office thats where i should be
do you want someone to accompany you

captain there is a malfunction in this station i cannot bring any information up on it science two does not function either sir
engineering to captain picard

we have something wrong with warp drive circuitry sir

transporter room six to bridge reporting transporter console malfunction sir
data this ship is less than a year out of spacedock what are the chances of this occurring
it is a virtual impossibility sir
so what the hell is going on here

and you are telling me there are no explanations for these malfunctions
at least sir all the department heads have reported the damage repaired
that was not my question number one what caused the malfunctions
i believe it was a rampant electronic short that jumped from system to system sir but the only thing is er
yes mister singh
that shouldnt be possible the affected systems dont generally interact with each other and where they do it wasnt an interlink that was malfunctioning
have you spoken with chief engineer argyle about this problem
with all the engineering staff sir theyre just as puzzled
well im not satisfied i want an explanation of this by the time we reach parliament
but sir
by the time we reach parliament mister singh

these weapons were taken from two of your people who were loitering out of sight in the vicinity of the selay delegation quarters would you care to explain sir
these are not weapons first officer they are tools we use these to dispatch the animals we consume
your food supply is not on the same deck as the selay delegation sir
and you have to admit that these could kill
i admit some of my people are impulsive and we all have reason to hate the selay
they appear to have the same feelings about you sir
the nature of politics
nevertheless chief delegate youre on notice that all of your weapons no matter what their basic function are being confiscated violence will not be tolerated on the enterprise
of course not and if any does occur let me assure you it will not be we anticans who start it
thank you sir

but we will finish it

sir warp power is fading
picard to engineering

what is the problem
we have lost the warp engine computer tie

warp five four three two
state of the art vessel data signal parliament well be delayed we will send a new arrival time as soon as it is determined
sir subspace radio is out

all right gentlemen your theories on this sudden vulnerability of these systems
if the enterprise were really this fragile sir she never would have left spacedock therefore her systems failures are not endemic to the ship but are the result of the actions of an unknown adversary
we have a saboteur aboard
i believe i said that
gentlemen the question is who i cant believe its one of our people
agreed it must be someone from either alien delegation now if the ferengi could have bought or bribed even one of them thats all that theyd need
ferengi contacts have been detected on both selay and antica sir
can any of you suggest any other suspects
youre sounding like a private eye sir
inquiry private eye
a private consulting investigator data who solves crimes
a most interesting occupation
in the world of fact probably not however in literature criminal detection can be a fascinating exercise the immortal sherlock holmes would have an interesting view of our mystery i believe
but im afraid were going to have to find our solution without historys greatest consulting detective


how about here mister singh if the control network breaks at this point
it bleeds warp engine commands off into dead ends excellent i believe i can handle it from here mister crusher
but sir
you are scheduled for class work now sorry
yes sir but i dont learn nearly this much in school
i tend to agree but the captains orders on this are very clear

hi solve any new problems today
i was starting to maybe mister singh sent me off to class
wes youre only an acting ensign youve got to let the commissioned officers do some of the work
mom ive learned a more than they understand for example the channings dilithium crystals theory i was telling you about
when were you telling me about that
this morning dont you remember
honestly i dont remember


engineering to captain picard security alert
picard
lieutenant worf sir i just found mister singh hes dead
captains log stardate  ive ordered an immediate investigation into the death of assistant chief engineer singh we continue to run on impulse power

he could have been working there restoring warp power
according to these readings we could go back to warp speed now
those arent the same readings as when i left
singh probably repaired it just before he was killed
he couldnt have repaired sir the problems were inside the engine
who else could have corrected it wes inform the bridge of engine status
engineering to bridge we now have warp capacity sir all power on line

well done warp engines ready on previous heading warp factor six

i tolerate these questions lieutenant yar because i need this vessel to get us to parliament your shipboard problems do not concern me
they should our delays are your delays
the peace conference will wait for us
i must ask where you were during this vessels earth hours of eighteen hundred last night and zero seven hundred this morning
eating
sir were talking about hours here
it was a large meal lieutenant yar and a very interesting animal

you wanted me doctor
yes concerning your memory blackout
i still dont remember having one
the same thing happened to me
i want to try hypnosis on both of you it may restore your memory as to what happened

one thing is clear almost all of the peace delegates answered our questions with lies
 imprecise lieutenant they omitted certain truths which in itself tells us something
we can learn something from nondisclosure
indubitably my good woman
its something the captain mentioned sherlock holmes indubitably data has been studying him
has studied sir every case as holmes wouldve pointed out during the time in question something was afoot
afoot
while both sets of delegates say they were in their quarters our crew locator sensed them passing here and here
but since it doesnt show where they went were still in the dark
on the contrary dear colleague on their return they drew medical supplies appropriate to the treatment of minor wounds and abrasions on these life forms
which leaves us with only one conclusion
exactly that they were too engaged in their own affairs to have disabled our ship and murdered the engineer given a choice theyd rather kill each other than any of us its elementary my dear riker sir


beverly can you hear me
yes
i want you to go back in your mind to the moment when you first recall this sensation of memory loss picture it exactly as it occurred
hes lying on the hospital bed sedated im walking up to him i
how do you feel at this moment as you lean over him to take the specimen
i feel someone else theres someone else whos there not alone get out get out of my mind
 thats almost exactly what you said as though there was something else inside you

which confirms the feeling of duality that i sensed earlier in both of them
why didnt you report it
because sir i assumed at first it was the kind of duality we betazeds feel in all of you even you sir when you approach a decision and ask yourself which way to go who are you talking to
your hypnotism revealed another form of duality
yes sir i believe something invaded them
it seems the only possible conclusion
data lets proceed without the pipe
yes sir if you wish sir but i ask if youd take it as incontrovertible that it cannot be a family member or one of our crew
yes very unlikely
then our investigation was worthwhile sir we have eliminated both the delegates and the ships regular complement
data what are you suggesting
i am referring to the great detectives credo sir i quote we must fall back on the old axiom that when other contingencies fail whatever remains however improbable must be the truth

that engine computer net wasnt repaired sir it just suddenly became all right
sometimes its the result that counts you know what the oh no
what is it
helm control just went down she wont respond
bridge to captain youre needed here immediately
wes alert engineering from your panel alright
im trying
report
helm is down sir theres no apparent reason
captain weve just dropped to impulse power

sir are you all right i thought i just saw
im fine everything is fine now why the drop to impulse power lieutenant
the helm is suddenly malfunctioning sir
malfunctioning youre wrong look again
sir i was just
mister la forge
well theres nothing wrong with it now sir everything is just as it should be
in that case make our heading nine two five mark three seven
sir
you have a problem with that heading lieutenant
you want to double back on our course sir
isnt that what i ordered
yes sir
sir im puzzled about your reversing our course
that energy cloud commander i believe it important we have another look at it
but were behind schedule for parliament already
i believe a very important scientific discovery awaits us on this heading
perhaps youd like to share your reasoning on that sir
yes since we obtained only minimal information on our sensor pass of it
right data we must go back to learn more counsellor do you believe a ship captain should explain every order
of course not sir

i demand to see the captain
 stop return to your quarters
what is that doing on our deck
i demand to know why this starship has changed its course
please return to your quarters delegates


a mere change of direction hardly justifies mutiny
exactly what do you believe youre sensing from him
its just a feeling that hes well that hes closed part of his mind to me i just feel that the captain has become perhaps dangerous
if hes dangerous if
then hed have to be relieved of command which you could do doctor but its beaucoup trouble if youre wrong
and at the moment it is all pure speculation he has done nothing to subject the enterprise to danger
id need a medical log citing clear evidence of incapacity you could do it without that problem
only if all command officers agreed it vital to do so but he has not been showing any overt unusual behaviour
ultimately i believe he will
as second in command its still in your corner ill order medical and psychiatric exams youll have to back me up somehow
first officers log supplemental after meeting with the senior officers doctor crusher and i decided to approach the captain regarding his recent behaviour

yes
id like you to come to sickbay for some examinations captain
oh ill be glad to do when im free
id like to conduct them now sir
why what can i do for you number one
sir counsellor troi has recommended the examinations
same question why
it is my duty to inform the captain we believe he may be under some kind of alien influence which may constitute a danger to this ship
i consider it equally possible that the two of you and counsellor troi are overworked and possibly suffering hallucinations now this is an order you will arrange medical and psychiatric exams of both yourself and them doctor are you aware everybody is behaving strangely
im concerned that youve suddenly turned the ship away from its course
whats happened to your mind doctor the search for knowledge is always our primary mission im sorry i really am too busy for this kind of nonsense do i have to call security to force you to report to the sickbay
no sir


what the hell
sorry wrong species
riker to security chief

yar here
security guard to the engineering deck

selays are playing hide and seek down here obviously with the anticans its a lethal game i want them returned to their quarters under guard
right away sir

come

what do you want
here are the results from the exams you ordered sir you dont care to inspect them please are you jeanluc
he is here
the jeanluc i know
and more
the more frightens me
and elates us we wish you could understand the glorious adventure ahead
you and
soon well both be home
first officers log supplemental on the orders of captain picard we have returned to the vicinity of the energy pattern cloud i am personally convinced that something from this cloud now shares the captains mind but there seems to be nothing we can do at least within regulations

were now approaching the cloud sir
very well mister la forge bring us to within ten thousand kilometres and hold us there
aye sir

shall we begin the scientific tests you wanted sir
oh theyre already underway i have an announcement for the entire bridge as many of you suspected when our ship passed through the edge of this it accidentally carried away a sentient being much like these energy patterns were seeing here a terrifying experience for any intelligent being as if a great claw had reached down and scooped one of you from your home world drawn into the energy circuits of this vessel it found its way to you worf frantic at being carried from its home world and recognising you as sentient beings it pleaded for help but in ways you couldnt understand desperately going from person to person and then discovering the computer intelligence in this ships memory circuits oh simplistic intelligence but it furnished it enough to slow this enterprise thing that had captured it and it very much regrets the accidental death of engineer singh
captain do you exist in combination with this entity
is it in control of you sir
very soon after we combined we had learned much about each other a passion for exploration for the unknown we found we had similar dreams and it offered your captain a way to realise them beyond human expectations
captain i must speak to you privately now
i understand as an energy pattern free of the limitations of matter he might travel anywhere at any velocity
captain do you hear me
sir i see no way for you to journey with an energy form
isnt there
hes planning to beam himself and the entity into that cloud
the transporter need not pattern your captain into matter well beam energy only and we will become a combined energy pattern of our life forms a resignation from this command and from starfleet has been appropriately recorded
i refuse to allow this sir
how does this resignation threaten the ship and its crew in any way
captain picard you are now relieved from duty i judge you to be disabled and mentally incapacitated

security red alert restrain the captain
where is he
this is blinding me
captain ill help you if youll let me

someone restrain the captain


first officers log supplemental more than an hour has passed since the captain beamed out energy only every effort has been made to determine his whereabouts

the transporter chief has no idea what the coordinates were sir
so hes just floating around out there how can we settle for that
give me a choice then
still no readings no sign of anything
mister la forge its time to set a course for parliament warp eight
were really leaving him
commander wait its the captain but only the captain hes out there alone
the entity has it abandoned him
no but the combination wasnt possible out there hes in trouble sir we have to beam him back
beam him back as what hes nothing but energy now
sir the entity was caught in the ships circuitry the captain might try to get in the same way if hes in trouble
bring us in closer la forge
moving in sir but where
theres no way to know lets hope he can come part way himself troi is there any way you can get a message to him
i wish i could
sensors monitoring the perimeter ships circuitry sir nothing
bring us right into the edge of it la forge
aye sir
sir on my sensor controls
theres somethings here i feel it
just as before going to worf first
something crazy on my panel commander riker  static
p for picard
hes in the ships circuitry come to the transporter room please there might be a way sir hurry

is it a wild theory data
i knew we had to have the captains physical pattern here sir he was the last one to beam out
is what youre thinking possible
unknown at this time sir i hope the captain remembers his physical pattern is here if he has his energy has moved into the transporter relays by now
i wish we had some sign that hes in here i guess we have no choice but to risk it
energising sir

what the devil am i doing here
sounds like our captain
but confused this picard pattern was formed before he went out there
whats happening to me number one i was preparing to beam out to somewhere and i remember there was talk of an entity but it all seems so vague
i believe the captain is now his separate self sir much of what happened is naturally missing
what are you talking about data is this still sherlock holmes
indubitably sir indubitably
well at least you got rid of the damn pipe
doctor crusher asked me to steer you past sickbay she said youve been looking very tired

captain
yes lieutenant
sorry commander but security team two reports theyve discovered a puddle of blood outside the selay quarters and they cant find one of the delegates and so
lieutenant this couldnt have waited a moment
its good to see you sir the problem is that one of the cooks has just been asked to broil reptile for the anticans and it looks like the selay delegate
riker with the peace delegates and all i think i do need a rest take charge number one
justice

captains log stardate  after delivering a party of earth colonists to the strnad solar system we have discovered another class m planet in the adjoining rubicun star system we are now in orbit there having determined it to be inhabited as well as unusually lovely my first officer has taken an away team down to make contact and they are in the process of returning to the ship


riker says the planets life forms are almost identical to us
hes very enthusiastic

captain sorry troi
the doctor has something very important to tell you captain
youve been talking about it for days shore leave for the crew
establishing that colony has been exhausting for the entire crew captain were not a supply vessel settling all those people has been a strain on everyone im tired myself

is it as good as your report suggests number one
as per report sir class m earthlike beautiful it will startle you
it sounds wonderful for the children the holodecks are marvellous of course but theres nothing like open spaces and fresh air
ive listed my report on their customs and laws sir fairly simple common sense things
theyre wild in some ways actually puritanical in others neat as pins ultralawful and make love at the drop of a hat
any hat
but the happiest report has its negatives lets start with them number one
there are none sir not that any of us can find
but there is a problem here sir
its the faulty reading i reported sir
im reading something off the starboard bow but there is nothing there
sensor technicians are working on it sir theyve identified it as a glitch in the system
i take it you find no glitch at all in this planet however
no sir
if you approve shore leave sir we could start with a small group
of course wesley if we go down id like you to join the away team to evaluate this world as a place for young people to relax
yes sir
if our scans and observations confirm the report of course ill approve it lets hope it is not too good to be true
captains log supplemental we are in orbit of a planet designated rubicun three the home of a life form who call themselves the edo our away team including wesley crusher has beamed down to make arrangements concerning some welldeserved recreation


careful sir
no its all right lieutenant those are the edo we met before they certainly are fit
they certainly are
 health and happiness
 a pleasant day to you
you did return as promised

rivan liator also from our vessel troi
slowly slowly i must also welcome this lovely one

nice to see you again
my pleasure
counsellor
healthy sensuality sir i feel mainly friendship and  happiness
and i welcome this huge one oh yes
 nice planet
yeah
but you are a young one i do not know your custom regarding love
er i guess whatever you usually do

there are others who would like to visit here if you would give us a limit on the numbers
whatever pleases you we can discuss it at the council chambers
shall we go there now or remain in play
play
at love unless you dont enjoy that  perhaps you do
and you  yes i can see that you do
maybe i should just go on ahead
oh this is unfair to him well go to the council chambers youll find young people your age there
well i cant make any promises
you dont have to our rules are simple no one does anything uncomfortable to them
come our people will want to know you
rivan perhaps they cant run
cant run sure we can run right commander
thats the custom here running lead the way

when in rome eh
when in where sir
good health to you
happiness to you its like an eden here


good health i thought you might be out of breath
we may surprise you in a lot of ways
children weve brought you a new friend
well hello join us
yes please

and now its time for you to meet some new friends


everyone weve brought the visitors
please enjoy what we have


ive traced it through our sensor channel sir it is not a glitch or any other form of error or malfunction
confirmed by my readings captain its a shadow something
exactly as if it were neither in or out of our dimension
what is commander
whatever is sitting out there without triggering our alarm relays sir
centre main viewer on that area i see nothing commander
enterprise to object off our starboard bow request that you identify yourself

shields and deflectors up full sir main phaser banks ready
hailing frequencies any reply
it was something unintelligible captain now running it through language and logic circuits
geordi
sir
have a real look
aye sir
 sir my sensors read it well its half there it does look as if it were partly transparent
data what the hell is it


lieutenant la forge to captain

go ahead laforge what can you make out

this is something ive never seen before sir after complete spectral analysis well its as if its not really there

i dont understand it
ive got some information on its first transmission sir it translates as stand by
 sir i see show something coming out of that ship
verified sir something very small

intruder alert sir i dont show a location
the away team signals been cut off captain weve lost contact with our people
intruder relays do show something
why has everything become a something or a whatever

state the purpose  state the purpose of what you have done
im captain picard commanding this federation starship
state the purpose of your visit here
we have sent down what we call an away team to make peaceful contact here
do you plan to leave life forms here
no we are merely visiting here
but you did more at the world you just left why have you left your own life forms there
the colony we just planted sir
we found that world uninhabited the life forms we left there had had sought the challenge at least that is the basic reason had sought the challenge of creating a new lifestyle a new society there life on our world is driven to protect itself by seeding itself as widely as possible
do not interfere with my children below

captain i do not understand how but it is asking me if i was constructed for information exchange
if there is any way of finding out whatever is out there data


watch i bet you cant do this

watch this

i want to do something too with you
er what
its something you can teach me will you
er well actually there are some games i dont quite know yet
its playing ball will you teach me
oh sure if you have a bat for the ball i can show you my favourite a bat a stick or branch about this thick this long
we can get it in the gardens come on

this will please you join us
thanks another time
joy and happiness
it certainly is the good life worf
i am not concerned with pleasure commander i am a warrior
even klingons need love now and then
for what we consider love sir i would need a klingon woman
what about plain old basic sex you must have some need for that
of course but with the females available to me sir earth females i must restrain myself too much they are quite fragile sir
worf if anyone else had said that id suspect he was bragging
bragging sir
i think ill pass on that id better check in enterprise come in captain do you read me lets this may be nothing but lets move all our people together
including wesley the boy hes outside
is there a problem
weve lost contact with our ship
its nothing these people have done im certain of that their minds are so open
help me locate wes hes wandered off

that is extraordinary
can i take a moment of your time lieutenant
yes worf but youve got to hear this are you telling me that theres no crime here whatsoever no one breaks any laws
once they did long long ago there was much disorder but not now
but i seen no sign of police those who enforce laws
oh we have very few they are called mediators and they are needed only in one place each day
the punishment zone an area thats selected for a period of time
its a completely random selection
no one but our mediators know what place or for how long were very proud of the wisdom of our ancestors no person ever knows where or when a zone will be
and so no one risks death
death
by breaking any law
wait explain this
only one punishment for any crime
anyone who commits any crime in the punishment zone dies
the law is the law our peace is built on that
even a small thing such as ignoring the rule keep off the grass
then no one breaks that rule who wants to risk execution and theres always a white wall or fence to remind anyone of a forbidden area like that
and just who tells visitors about these rules
wed better find wesley


youre very clever at this
at home we play a lot of it here toss the ball ahead of me

no wes
no its forbidden to disturb new plants

couldnt you see the fence its for new plants dont ever go past a white marker
its okay im fine

oh no oh please no
speak the truth we are mediators
i said i was fine
he doesnt know hes from another place
how very sad but this zone has been selected
but he doesnt understand
its always sad now doubly so

i was chasing a ball and i fell into that im really sorry
you admit you did that freely
im with starfleet we dont lie
it wont happen again we apologise
were sorry too but that changes nothing

careful commander theyve got some strange laws here
i thought you reviewed their laws
but they listed nothing about punishment
one moment please is there a witness to this transgression
but it was my fault i threw the ball past him
we have a visible transgression ample witnesses and an admission of guilt and though it deeply pains us to do it we must

are you prepared for punishment
punishment if you mean what the others were talking about
what punishment name it
death of course dont make it difficult for the boy

drop it drop it now

its a kind of syringe
what is this you said death is this poison
but of course it is completely painless the boy would have felt nothing but look at him now youve frightened him
he was going to kill me
and if this zone were still in effect you would all deserve death
it was announced you came as friends is this how friends act
enterprise from away team come in are you receiving us enterprise


condition
no sign of consciousness but the balance of the readings are quite normal for him
i believe this is some form of information exchange with whatever is over there at least i hope it is
any communication from the away team
something is blocking communication both

security urgent repeating enterprise from away team
this is the enterprise lieutenant were receiving you now
this is an urgent call for captain picard
we may need your presence here captain we have serious trouble with a member of our away team and an unusual law they have here
captain to riker stand by signs of consciousness
not yet could be minutes or hours its unclear whats happened to him
take him to sickbay let me know the instant hes awake anything new on that that thing out there
negative sir
captain to first officer im beaming down

would you care to comment privately how you read any of this
unnecessary sir these people are honest almost to a fault and they have great pride in their ways
youre the captain were ready this way please

welcome to our world captain
thank you
we regret that our system of justice is troubling you
the boy wesley crusher where is he please
in accord with the prime directive ive allowed them to hold him pending the outcome of this
he is safe and unharmed we promise that captain picard i do not know how you earth people conduct law and justice even if you respect such things
we do
good so do we our precepts have been handed down from long ago the tranquillity you see in our lives has been made possible by our laws
we are a people of law they do sometimes bring us sadness but we have learned to adjust to that perhaps your laws work as well
they havent always but now they do
do you execute criminals
no not any longer
but you did once
unfortunately yes but since then
but when you did was it believed necessary to do so
some people felt that it was necessary but we have learned to detect the seeds of criminal behaviour capital punishment in our world is no longer considered a justifiable deterrent
so we are not yet as advanced as they are and since you are advanced in other ways too i suggest you use your superior powers to rescue the wesley boy we will record him as a convicted criminal out of our reach an advanced person who luckily escaped the barbarism of this backward little world
unfortunately we have a law known as the prime directive
riker has explained it to us
is the boy in any danger from you at this moment
until sundown
because you are strangers we are delaying enforcement of the law but we must act by sundown
then i have another question while orbiting while circling high above your world as we do we have encountered a strange object a vessel perhaps have you any idea what it is its not entirely real at least its not completely solid
do you mean god
god
god is said to be somewhere up there protecting us
exactly exactly how would you describe god
as you just did as existing both here and in another place also
but when god wants to show its power it can make itself felt most fully
captain come in please
picard here
cmo crusher sir

commander data has just regained consciousness
what condition can he talk
hes insisting on it sir urgently

 wesley
stand by picard out i want to speak to her personally about her son so you promise that wesley crusher is safe until sundown
you have our word
then will one of you return with me to our vessel
of course ill go as a hostage for the boys safety
no no no thats not it i want you to identify something for me if you can captain to transporter room three to beam up

im frightened
theres no reason to be
transporter room energise

but this is a city a great city
captain ive just seen the away team report about wesley
in a moment doctor
in a moment
exactly in a moment you were about to say
since you have all this power why be concerned about our laws you could take the boy from us
its not that simple from the starboard lounge you can see whatever is outside this vessel
do you mean my world you said wed be high above it
and something else thats circling your world its very important to us and perhaps to you to know what it is


im sorry rivan but this was necessary do you know what that is
can you tell us what it is
is it god  now its very important you answer something how do you recognise what it is
nothing will harm you i promise just tell us how you recognise it
it has appeared before
can you speak to it does it speak to you
captain

return my child
return
its coming toward us
picard to transporter room come in

yes do that but hurry
its still coming toward us
transporter chief to captain
one to beam down to away team location hurry engage transporter room urgent engage

it seems the edos god is very protective of its children
i had no choice but to learn about that thing from her im sorry i had to she was so frightened
its understandable sir sharing an orbit with god is no small experience
lets go see your patient doctor

what do you intend to do about my son
hes being held safely until sundown
when he faces execution although hes committed no crime certainly none that any sane and reasonable person would
you saw what that thing was about to do
i apologise sir but this is very difficult for me if he were your son youd be as frightened
but i am
data is in sickbay here youll find him able to talk to you

hes checking out fine doctor
thank you finish it later please
i was an excellent choice for them captain they were able to communicate with me quite i was about to say quite easily but there was nothing easy about it fortunately they stopped short of overloading my circuitry
youre saying they it is a vessel of some sort
definitely not a single entity if thats what you mean sir although they know the edo worship them as a god thing
they know
they recognise that this is quite expected and harmless at the present edo stage of evolution
what sort of vessel
it is perhaps not what we would understand as a vessel sir the dimensions this one occupies allows them to be well to be in several places at once but they consider this entire star cluster to be theirs it was probably unwise of us to attempt to place a human colony in this area of course there are three thousand four other planets in this star cluster in which we could have colonised the largest and closest
data dont babble
babble sir im not aware that i ever babble sir it may be that from time to time i have considerable information to communicate and you may question the way i organise it
please organise it into brief answers to my questions we have very little time do they accept our presence at this planet
undecided sir
data please feel free to volunteer any important information
i volunteer that they are now observing us sir
to judge what kind of life forms we are
no it is more curiosity sir i doubt that they expect us to abide by their value systems
do they know of our prime directive
they know everything i know sir
and if we were to violate the prime directive how
thats not a fair question
how would they react
it would be a case of judging us by our own rules sir if we violate our own prime directive they might consider us to be deceitful and untrustworthy you do recall they cautioned us not to interfere with their children below what has happened
the edo want to execute my son i will not allow that to happen jeanluc
most interesting sir the emotion of motherhood compared to all others felt by
shut up

you were right sir i do tend to babble
captains log stardate  whatever the object or vessel in orbit with us it hangs there like a nemesis it is one thing to communicate with something mysterious but it is quite another to be silently observed by it i am concerned whether it understands the same concept of reason that we do

you sent for me sir
lets have more talk data
yes sir
sit down
what level of communication sir
any my apologies for saying that you babbled
but i do sir
you also see things in a way we do not but as they truly are i need help my friend i cannot permit that boy or any member of this vessel be sacrificed the prime directive never intended that
the problem sir is there  although theyve learned of the prime directive from my mind how will they evaluate it how do they reason what are their values remember their warning to us sir
exactly how do i explain my refusing to obey their laws down there not permitting the crusher boy to be executed and by so doing do i endanger this vessel and more than a thousand other lives
would you choose one life over one thousand sir
i refuse to let arithmetic decide questions like that did you learn anything about the relationship between that and the edo why are they so certain its a god
any sufficiently advanced life form would appear to others to be that sir but when they were probing my thoughts captain i could feel that whatever they are now they once existed in this dimension just as we do perhaps in the same kind of flesh and blood form since then however they have evolved considerably their present existence in multidimensions no doubt has advantages we do not understand
then in some earlier flesh and blood form they might have shared our kind of values
we know the edo share them sir
why would such an advanced thing feel obliged to protect the edo
perhaps the edo are a child race by comparison possibly a race which those life forms have planted here much as we plant human colonies on classm planets

having fulfilled my professional obligations regarding commander data
you now request permission to beam down to the planet permission granted you can accompany me while i try and resolve this and you should know that whatever the cost i will not allow them to execute your son
thank you sir
data take command
aye sir

its almost time i want the boy brought here now

ill go along with you
of course

captain picard i saw you share the sky with god you must be gods
no no were not gods

mother i guess you know a lot has happened here
i know
captain picard are you going to let them kill me
no but i must find some way to prevent it that you understand
how can we let this happen liator they threaten everything we respect our law our peace our tranquillity and order
you are powerful but do not do this to us we beg you at least study what we were without law hurtful to each other savage thieving
i understand perhaps your system of law and punishment is better than any system we once had but we do now have a law i must obey and part of it says i must protect my people from harm
we did not ask you to come here
which has to do with another law that we must obey
we are all sworn not to interfere with other lives in the galaxy if i save this boy i break that law
and you should be executed if you do so
i may suffer almost as much starfleet takes the prime directive very seriously
no it is god who will punish you
that thought has crossed our minds your god up there may insist that we obey our noninterference directive
sir does this mean if you save me the entire crew could die
youre not involved in this decision boy
im sorry sir but it seems like i am
picard to transporter room lock into this signal stand by for six to beam up wesley lieutenant

our laws have been violated what of justice
what of justice to wesley does he deserve to die
im truly sorry liator but i must have justice for my people too transporter room energise

transporter room come in
we cant energise the beam sir everything checks out but were getting no results
god has prevented your escape
then your god is unfair my son had no warning that his act was criminal
we cannot allow ignorance of the law to become a defence
i dont know how to communicate this or even if it is possible but the question of justice has concerned me greatly of lately and i say to any creature who may be listening there can be no justice so long as laws are absolute even life itself is an exercise in exceptions
when has justice ever been as simple as a rulebook

it seems the edo lord agrees with you number one

main viewer on
hailing frequencies
open sir
to the object in orbit with us we will remove the human colonists from the adjoining solar system if you signal us to do so please tell us
captain

is that a signal
i suppose i suppose it must be i was hoping for more
more of what sir im glad its gone
agreed sir short and sweet godlike efficiency
i was hoping wed learn more about it but since we cant take us out of here number one
gladly sir
the battle

captains log stardate  in response to a starfleet order we are in the xendi sabu star system having rendezvoused with a ferengi vessel which has requested a meeting although we arrived here and made appropriate signals to the ferengi three days ago they have so far responded only with the message stand by enterprise


you sent for me sir
yes doctor sit down look this perhaps may be nothings but ive been feeling a bit odd of late fatigued and now ive got this damned headache
a what
headache headache surely you know what a headache is
of course but i dont often encounter them
the reason is obvious of course what are the ferengi up to stand by enterprise stand by for what
i dont see a thing wrong
no neither can i unless theyre baiting some kind of trap
with your head i see nothing physically wrong but i want to run some additional scans in sickbay
doctor all ive got is
is an order to report to sickbay from the one person aboard this ship who can give you an order
captain from first officer theyre finally sending a message
on my way number one sorry doctor duty calls

theyre prepared to talk sir
have they given any hint of what theyve been waiting for
negative captain theyve identified their captain as bok daimon bok
youll be able to see him now sir theyre willing to communicate on visual
open hailing frequencies
hailing frequencies open sir
ferengi vessel this is captain jeanluc picard of the enterprise we are transmitting visually
is this the captain picard
do we know each other
i know you picard
then you have the advantage is this bok
i am bok daimon of the ferengi i have asked you here to discuss a mutual problem captain
what problem is that daimon bok
i insist on speaking of that matter in person shall we meet on your vessel or mine

hailing frequencies closed
captain i sense considerable deception on boks part and danger
then we should meet him here keep him under our control

now open sir
i appreciate your offer daimon bok we would like you to be our guest here
as you wish picard perhaps this will begin a new era of cooperation for both our peoples in one earth hour then
in one hour daimon bok end transmission
i cant believe theyre coming here
they did agree a bit easily well in one hour we shall know why


are you always accustomed to getting your way doctor
only when my way makes sense captain there are still forty minutes before the ferengi beam over ill have these scans done in ten
it seems an awful lot of effort for something as simple as a headache
as simple you should not have a headache unless theres something wrong sir it may be true that headaches were once quite common but that was in the days before the brain was charted before we understood the nature of pain when we were suffering from such things as the common cold
so whats the cause of my headache
i havent the slightest idea  feel better
the pains gone
medical fakery the pain is actually still there its just cloaked ill want further exams
doctor
when the ferengi matter is settled


commander youll soon be getting an intruder alert
what wesley if youve something to report
if youll scan heading four four mark one six three lieutenant youll find
intruder alert sir
ive got something sir
its an old style starship constellation class heading this way under impulse power sir

says who
ensign answer the first officers question
says the long distance sensors sir i was in engineering playing around with boosting sensor output
boosting it how  we will discuss this later
i read it now sir as a constellation class starship heading this way under impulse power sending no call letters sir
the correct procedure
whats wrong sir
oh its nothing its just a just a mild headache the correct procedure ensign would have been to signal the bridge of your finding immediately
yes sir
bringing it here personally perhaps with the idea of being on hand for the ferengi beam over might have imperiled this vessel had it been something hostile approaching
yes sir
we are receiving no signal at all from the approaching starship sir
time sir
time oh for the ferengi to beam over do you see any problems connected with this old starship coming in number one
suggest it would be safer sir to have the ferengi here whatever happenings
concur stand by
hailing frequencies open sir

welcome you in peace to the enterprise daimon bok
it is our pleasure captain picard might i introduce my first officer kazago and my second rata
this is my first officer commander william riker second in command data counsellor troi
we have heard that you use females clothed females most interesting
they are that sir
and the android was mentioned too what is its price we should like to purchase it
he is not for sale commander data is um is um
is secondhand merchandise you wouldnt want him
secondhand sir oh of course a human joke
excuse captain but the unidentified starship is coming in still no signal at all
think nothing of it it is under our control
one of our starships under your control
do not be alarmed captain it is a gift from us with which we honour the hero of maxia
who
why you picard of course do you not remember the battle of maxia
im sorry i do not remember it daimon bok data
captain he may refer to an incident which occurred nine years ago in the maxia zeta star system in which an unidentified starship
unidentified that fine vessel was ferengi
which you destroyed sir
the battle of maxia ive never heard it referred to so dramatically before my sincere regrets bok but that vessel refused to identify itself it simply attacked us we defended ourselves
such mistakes happen in space
hardly a mistake sir your report shows that it deliberately attacked
do you want the arriving vessel on main viewer sir it is only a thousand kilometres away now
put it on your viewer
main viewer
there is no one aboard it
the log should be downloaded into the enterprises records at a price
no price
no price
for what purpose what 
i just felt something too captain
perhaps it is his conscience
bridge to sickbay
no no im fine
it felt as if it were something from your past
its right im fine what is this all about
it is about the battle i mentioned captain a gift in honour of that occasion look at that ship closely
magnify please lieutenant la forge
aye sir
why its the stargazer its my old ship how did you find it
it was a derelict adrift in space on the far side of this star system how it got there is none of my business captain but now that vessel is yours if you wish to have it
we are not selling it to him
consider it an act of friendship
at no cost oh ugly very ugly
captains log supplemental bok and his officers have returned to their vessel inviting us now to officially take possession of the stargazer


like before
no it hit with more impact
hit im sorry but anything could be important
you said you felt something yourself
i believe so like a thought but rather mechanical in nature
are you sure it wasnt one of my thoughts at that moment i was remembering being at the helm of the stargazer a manoeuvre was being made we were hit somethings burning i can smell smoke can you smell it
theres nothing burning jeanluc
that was just part of my memory
memory or nightmare

well it was strong whatever it was are you ready number one
staffs waiting if doctor crusher approves
ill do better than that ill go along


we were traveling at warp two through the maxia zeta star system when this unidentified starship suddenly appeared and fired on us pointblank range
where did it come from
it must have been lying in some deep moon crater first attack damaged the shields in the confusion they hit us a second time
no clue who they were
no names no reason can you identify them vigo if they come in a second time with our shields damaged
sir whos vigo
hes my weapons officer on the stargazer im getting quite caught up in this
your shields were failing sir
i improvised with the enemy vessel coming in for the kill i ordered a sensor bearing and when it went into the return arc
you performed what starfleet textbooks now refer to as the picard manoeuvre
well i did what any good helmsman would have done i dropped into high warp stopped right off the enemy vessels bow and fired with everything i had
and blowing into maximum warp speed you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once
and our attacker fired on the wrong one
i did what any good helmsman could have done you did it first sir
it was a save our skins manoeuvre we were finished on fire we had to abandon ship we limped through space in shuttlecraft for weeks before we were picked up i havent thought about this for years
sir the ferengi are standing by for us to take possession of the stargazer
i want to go over to her
i understand sir as soon as my people have made certain shes safe
and after i have another look at you captain


 uss stargazer constellation class starfleet registry ncc 

i activated the emergency power cells amazing they still work
the rest of the ship is clear of surprises lieutenant yar
i read about this ship at the academy i never dreamed id ever be on her
yar to enterprise all clear sir 
hello old friend
youll find this most intriguing sir
what did you find data
the last entry dated nine years ago sir by you  we are forced to abandon our starship may she find her way without us apparently she did sir
how do you feel captain
oh im fine doctor lieutenant yar run a structural analysis on the stargazer for an impulse tow data download all computers to the enterprise and file im going to look at my old cabin




try this hero of maxia



captain another headache this really worries me i want you back on the enterprise
but my things
ill see theyre sent to your enterprise quarters

enterprise now taking possession of stargazer kazago
permission granted riker
actually it was quite a bargain kazago i thought the ferengi always made a profit on things

set subwarp speed for towing laforge
aye sir

starfleet has responded to our request sir a tug will rendezvous with us and tow the stargazer back to xendi starbase nine
very well data
how was it captain
very strange number one like going back to the house you grew up in but no ones home except the phantoms of the past
it has troubled you
not half as much as this damn headache take over number one
aye sir

whats wrong
i wish i could say


shields weakening captain torpedoes armed where are they oh my god sir fire fire

what is it data why all the mystery
the records of the stargazer sir what the ferengi call the battle of maxia it seems the captains personal log contains a much different version of that conflict than the official historic account
what are you saying
it would appear that the starship which captain picard attacked had in fact been under a flag of truce
what
and apparently the captain destroyed the ship without notice or provocation
impossible what about the fire aboard the stargazer
an accident in engineering
and what proof
it is logged in his own voice sir would you care to hear it sir sir

this is a confession given by me jeanluc picard commanding uss stargazer
what does this mean
i dont know sir it sounds like your voice
it is number one
i refuse to believe you ever said that
i admit i must have mistaken their subspace antenna for a weapons cluster unfortunately i fired our main phasers and our direct hit destroyed the unknown vessel
ive assumed theyve simulated your voice somehow ive already put data to work on it
thank you will i never made that log entry of course but it still leaves you with a duty to perform
i know sir i must report it to starfleet thats at least one full day for subspace communications to reach there
and one more full day for their answer to return id like the truth on this by then id hate to have to prepare a formal defence
i cant believe theyd ask for your command
why wouldnt they with the ferengi making these friendship overtures i could become a severe embarrassment to starfleet
im certain the ferengi are behind the faked log no wonder theyre waiting out there headache back sir
damn ill call the doctor again
its no wonder with all this going on try to relax

picard  this is a confession given by me jeanluc picard commanding uss stargazer in the hopes that my belated honesty will be taken into account by starfleet when judging my actions during a confrontation with an unidentified vessel

open hailing frequencies geordi
open sir
ill take it in the ready room secure channel la forge
secure sir

starship ferengi this is commander riker here id like to speak to first officer kazago
a problem riker
are our channels secure on your end
it is now
are you aware of the details of the battle of maxia
captain bok has just made me aware of it riker the infamy of your picard is now fully known
infamy
i would call the wanton destruction of an unarmed vessel infamy
and if i produced evidence that captain picards log entry was falsified to indicate that
i can hardly imagine you contacted me to discuss an ancient battle what do you want of me
just one question
as you humans say im all ears
first officer to first officer kazago if your captain bok knew about this then why this peaceful meeting to present us with the stargazer
we freely give you back your derelict warship and now you accuse us of crime riker i can bear no more insults


yes who the hell is it

not resting captain
more like dying doctor
over here
what is wrong with me
i wish to hell i knew captain but something unusual has definitely been happening to you
why do doctors always say the obvious as though its a revelation
why do captains always act like theyre immortal

no



you didnt tell me it had been this bad
it wasnt this bad but its getting worse
this should help a little its got to be some kind of emotional pressure connected with the stargazer
i got this headache long before i even knew my old ship still existed still perhaps youre partly right
want to talk about it im here
the fight at maxia i destroyed an entire vessel an entire crew
did you have a choice
i dont know anymore i just dont know
commander rikers told me about the altered log if thats whats troubling you
the last three nights ive ive heard these voices im on the bridge of my old ship theres fire all around me the klaxons smoke and then i give the order and now the stargazer is really here and that log am i going crazy how do i know i was in my right mind at maxia how do i know im in my right mind now

what was that
something to let you sleep

yes sleep sleep

shields weakening captain torpedoes armed where are they

and now dear captain you are ready to live the past


where did they come from phasers sir sir sir what should we do sir should we fire back fire captain fire

you will injure yourself as you once injured me

sir

damage report
fusion generator under surge control sir power systems failing
sensor beam bearing on hostile ship
seven mark nineteen sir
phasers sir sir
ready phasers and lock stand by on warp nine heading seven seven mark twenty engage
steady now reverse and stop phasers fire torpedoes away fire fire

by comparing the stargazers main computer log with captain picards personal log i have found checksum discrepancies sir
what does that mean
all information is timecoded by entry and the bits when totaled produce an aggregate amount which
i dont want a computer science lesson data bottom line
one of these two logs is a forgery sir
correction the log just found aboard the stargazer is a forgery
as i said that is one of them is it not

captain youre looking better sir
a little sleep thanks to the good doctor works wonders what report on the logs
yes sir whoever tampered with your personal log was clever
but a bit clumsy its definitely a fabrication sir

number one id like you to take a look at this brain scan graph what are you doing here
i thought i was captain of this starship
of course you are but i
thank you for the confirmation doctor but now except for riker i would like you all to return to your stations is that clear
sir

you too doctor i have business with the commander
under protest captain

you have orders for me sir
release the stargazer from the tractor beam number one
sir
the tractor beam
sir are you abandoning
no but her inertia will carry the stargazer along with us or did you sleep through the academy lecture on conservation of tractor beam power
no sir ill release her of course


obviously theres some thought process disorder but i cant find a physical reason for it anything
im puzzled too i keep sensing random thoughts but two sets of them as if they were his but intermixed other thoughts which are also his

im busy at the moment wesley
i know mom but this is important when i went back to the main sensors in engineering to try some more sensitivity experiments
does this have something to do with captain picard
yes maam if this is what youre talking about here i dont know much about brain scans but i glanced at these when you were studying them and i noticed that these patterns are the same as those picked up from the lowintensity transmissions from the ferengi ship i went back and checked and theyre exactly the same
what kind of transmissions
i dont know engineering has nothing like it on record
lets get to the captain
no they might be affecting the captain to riker

youre welcome ladies adults

the captain commander
resting in his quarters after ordering both of you to your duty stations
there have been some did he say low intensity some unusual low intensity transmissions from the ferengi vessel
did who say
my son transmissions which exactly match certain anomalies found in the captains brain scans something over there is affecting the captains thought patterns
computer give me a location on captain picard
captain picard is in transporter room three
what computer emergency order to transporter room three
new information captain picard is no longer aboard the enterprise


welcome back captain

what is happening
shields up computer
what are you doing
collecting on an old debt


stargazer captain respond
shields up sir no way to beam over any help
commander im reading something very strange here a low intensity beam of intermittent pulse inside this starship
i have a fix on it sir inside captain picards quarters
you transferred some of his belongings from the stargazer
yes including a fairly heavy chest
go take a look fast
commander stargazer is now powering up sir

i have been waiting a long nine years for this picard
i dont know what youre talking about
do you not human can you not remember the crime you committed against my very blood you murdered my only son
your son
he was the commander of the ship you destroyed on his first voyage as daimon
the ship the ferengi ship that attacked me or is it about to attack me
and i have spent these years searching seeking a proper blood revenge and i found it i am rich picard yet two of these cost me the profits of an entire life you are back in command of the stargazer picard its computers will answer your orders die well captain

first officers log captain picard has beamed himself to the stargazer which is now moving away from us under its own power

enterprise to stargazer please respond enterprise to captain picard aboard stargazer please answer mister data what was stargazers condition
considerable fire damage to interior surface reported sir but none of her main systems were crippled
armaments lieutenant yar
six photon torpedoes short sir probably used when the captain destroyed his ferengi attackers nine years ago otherwise fully armed

what do you make of it la forge
it seems to be a network of miniature circuitry sir incredibly complex maybe an amplifier
where was it in the captains quarters mister worf
his chest from the stargazer sir just where i had left it he hadnt yet unpacked
so he may not have even known it was there and if this is able to pick up or magnify thoughtaltering transmissions
it could have prepared him for whatever is happening now
lets find out or try to contact the ferengi vessel lieutenant
hailing frequencies open sir
enterprise to ferengi vessel we transmit visually do you respond
why is our gift to you under power human
i will discuss that with your captain
he is working in our ships laboratory where is your captain
hes beamed himself aboard the stargazer and im wondering if this has something to do with it
how do you have possession of that
it was found in our captains chest which brought over from the stargazer
it is a forbidden device a thought maker if your captain is criminal enough to own one
kazago you know who controls those spheres now i ask you again first officer to first officer whats going on
it is not seemly to question ones own daimon riker i am not prepared to do that
sir i have the stargazer
switch now enterprise to picard
do not attack again we are on a peaceful mission give your identity you force us to defend ourselves phasers full up arm torpedoes why arent the shields at full power
weve lost him sir
when he put up the shields sir


damn i said put fusion generators under surge control youre moving too slowly arm the torpedoes man vigo get a fire control party up here
shields weakening captain fusion generator online
weapons report
phasers coming to full charge sir torpedoes armed
who are they identify them
theyre coming for a third pass at us sir
we cant take another hit captain

sir i now feel anger from our captain fury over whatever it is he is reliving out there
the battle of maxia sir thats what it is
the picard manoeuvre what is the defence against that data
there is no defence sir
then devise one fast
first officer kazago to human riker
not now kazago
we do not wish to become involved in what has become clearly a federation matter
fine fine enterprise out
you should also know that daimon bok no longer commands this vessel his first officer has confined him for engaging in this unprofitable venture good luck first officer riker
i have computed a possibility commander since even deep space contains trace gases sir a vessel in the picard manoeuvre might seem to disappear but our sensors could locate any sudden compression of those gases
and use it as an aiming point and blow our captain to bits
this class starship has enough power to use our tractor beam on it seize it limit its field of fire
right concentrate shields at that point make it so i hope youre right data
no question of it sir
stand by

lock on tractor beam


ready phasers
captain picard listen to me
vigo is that you
its commander riker sir
captain hear me look around you the ferengi are using their thought devices on you
stand by who is this
its riker sir your number one look for a silver sphere destroy it with your phaser
phaser a sphere bok used it
destroy it
phaser destroy the sphere destroy the sphere


are you all right captain

captain captain are you all right captain are you all right
where am i number one
aboard the stargazer sir the sphere you destroyed its been controlling your
bok where is bok
removed from command sir placed under guard for his act of personal vengeance seems there was no profit in it
in revenge there never is let the dead rest and the past remain the past enterprise lock on beam me home riker
hide and q

captains log stardate  having dropped off counsellor troi at starbase g for a shuttle to visit home we were fortunately close to the sigma three solar system when its federation colony transmitted an urgent call for medical help an accidental explosion has devastated a mining operation there

include a burn unit with each kit upon arrival identify the most critically injured and beam them up to cargo bay six
doctor crusher this is the captain
doctor crusher here

additional information the number of colonists at the site is five hundred and four are you prepared for that many doctor
we believe so sir
captain we are now at warp nine point one sir
which will bring us to the colony in three point two hours sir
captain i have a schematic of the explosion site it suggests the cause as a methanelike gas seeping in from underground
captain im picking up a forcefield out there of some kind its almost
the chainlink that envelopes the enterprise is straight out of
encounter at farpoint
the q entity sir it is identical to the grid we encountered when
it reads solid sir
emergency full stop
reversing power sir
not now damn it q
shields and deflectors up sir
now reading full stop sir

humans i thought by now you would have scampered back to your own little star system
if this is q im addressing we are on a mission of rescue where a group of badly injured
we the q have studied our recent contact with you and are impressed we have much to discuss including perhaps the realisation of your most impossible dream
however intriguing that may be we are now in the midst of an urgent journey once that is completed then perhaps
you will abandon that mission captain my business with you takes precedence if my magnificence blinds you then perhaps something more familiar

starfleet admiral q at your service
captains log supplemental our rescue mission to the sigma three solar system has been halted by an immense grid and an untimely visit from q

youre no starfleet admiral q
neither am i an aldebaran serpent captain but you accepted me as such
hes got us there captain
the redoubtable commander riker whom i noticed before you seem to find this all very amusing
i might if we werent on our way to help some suffering and dying humans who
your species is always suffering and dying
no lieutenant worf youll make no move against him unless i order it
pity you might have learned an interesting lesson macro head with a micro brain
you said you had the realisation of impossible dreams to offer us when this rescue is completed i am prepared to listen carefully to whatever proposal you wish to make and subject to it being acceptable
subject to your foolish human values oh come picard why do you distrust me so
why at our first meeting you seized my vessel you condemned all humans as savages and on that charge you tried us in a postatomic twenty first century court of horrors where you attacked my people you again seized my vessel
and that angered you did it seized my vessel seized my vessel
you interfered with our farpoint mission you threatened to convict us as ignorant savages if while dealing with a powerful and complex life forms we made the slightest mistake and when that didnt happen
the q became interested in you does no one here understand your incredible good fortune seized my vessel these are the complaints of a closed mind too accustomed to military privileges but you riker and i remember you well what do you make of my offer
we dont have time for these games
games did someone say games and perchance for interests sake a deadly game to the game



where are we
obviously a class m world gravity and oxygen within our limits
twin moons where are we
considering the power demonstrated by q the last time anywhere assuming this place even exists
but this wont be boring if q is anything hes imaginative apparently our captain wasnt meant to be with us here

security this is the captain security engineering this is the bridge

turbolift control do you read this is the captain


sir over here

join me riker a good game needs rules and planning wasnt it your own hartley who said nothing reveals humanity so well as the games it plays almost right actually you reveal yourselves best in how you play
sir what he has in mind might provide us with vital information

incredible i was just thinking about an oldfashioned lemonade
and so it became that an excellent thirst quencher it gets rather hot out on this plain
what about my people
whatever theyd like of course

drink not with thine enemy the rigid klingon code that explains something of why you defeated them
youre still fascinated with the human past perhaps youre not that original
au contraire its the human future which intrigues us and should concern you most you see of all species yours cannot abide stagnation change is at the heart of what you are but change into what thats the question
that is what humans call a truism
you mean hardly original
youre the one who said it while were at it this isnt part of any human future
true i borrowed this from your stodgy captains mind this is dressing for a game that we will play now games require rules and rewards and dangers and familiar settings that sort of thing
this isnt that familiar to me data
this is from europes napoleonic era sir late eighteenth early nineteenth centuries this is a campaign headquarters tent his uniform is that of a french army marshal
and a marshal outranks even an admiral
well do you think i would go from a starfleet admiral to anything else
of course you wouldnt but napoleonic equipment on an alien planet one so different it has twin moons
well as you said im nothing if not imaginative and the game should reflect that shall it be a test of strength meaningless since you have none a test of intelligence then equally as meaningless but it needs risk something to win and something to lose
if we must play a game what would we win
the greatest possible future that you can imagine which of course requires something totally disastrous if you lose now the point of this game shall be can any of you can stay alive
if your game is fair we will
oh for shame worf fairness is such a human concept think imaginatively this game shall in fact be completely unfair
youve gone too far
game penalty

where is she q you can forget your game if
to use a twentieth century term shes in a penalty box where she will remain unharmed unless one of you merits a penalty unfortunately there is only one penalty box if any of you should be sent there dear tasha must give the box up to you
and where does she go
into nothingness i entreat you to carefully obey the rules of the game the only one who can destroy your tasha now is you

captains log
captains log
damn it i cant even make a log entry
i wish i could help you captain
where is everyone else
down on some planet
some planet what are you doing here
well i er it sounds strange but im in a penalty box
a penalty box
qs penalty box it sounds strange but it definitely isnt i know that one more penalty by anyone and im gone
gone
yes i am gone it is so frustrating to be controlled like this
lieutenant tasha its all right
what the hell am i doing crying
dont worry theres a new ships standing order on the bridge when one is in the penalty box tears are permitted
captain oh if you werent a captain
consorting with lower rank females captain especially ones in penalty boxes destructive to discipline they say but then again youre what youre only human penalty over
a marshal of france ridiculous
one takes what jobs he can get for example star log entry stardate today this is q speaking for captain jeanluc picard who we consider too bound by starfleet customs and traditions to be useful to us the enterprise is now helpless stuck like an earth insect in amber while its bridge crew plays out a game whose real intent is to test whether the first officer is worthy of the greatest gift the q can offer
so youre taking on riker this time excellent hell defeat you just as i did
shall we wager on that captain your starship command against
against your keeping out of humanitys path for ever done
done youve already lost picard riker will be offered something impossible to refuse

geordi can you see worf
id see the freckles on his nose if he had them sir hes at the third ridge
the third ridge
moving well too oh oh good he sees them


listen to me q you seem to have some need for humans
concern regarding them
whatever it is why do you demonstrate it through this confrontation why not a simple direct explanation a statement of what you seek why these games
why these games why the plays the thing and im surprised you have to ask when your human shakespeare explained it all so well
so he did but dont depend too much on any single viewpoint
its a pity you dont know the content of your own library hear this picard and reflect all the galaxys a stage
world not galaxy all the worlds a stage
oh you know that one well if he were living now he would have said galaxy how about this life is but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing
i see so how we respond to a game tells you more about us than our real life this tale told by an idiot interesting q
oh thank you very much im glad you enjoyed it perhaps maybe a little hamlet
oh no i know hamlet and what he might said with irony i say with conviction what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculty in form in moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god
surely you dont really see your species like that do you
i see us one day becoming that q is it that what concerns you

those soldiers have formed a skirmishing line i think youd call it and theyre headed this way
armed with ancient ball and powder muskets
thats what their weapons look like sir
muskets are appropriate to the  to  french army uniform sir but it is hardly a weapon by our standards a lead ball propelled by gunpowder one hundred metres at best with any accuracy
yeah but against phasers just one of our hand phasers could finish off an entire regiment
except for one thing it hardly sounds like q to give us an advantage like that unless

drop your weapons
im afraid that was me worf i was checking to see if the phasers still operate
incredible worf you came out of nowhere
a warriors reaction
report what did you find
sir what theyre wearing may be old earth uniforms but whats inside of them isnt human at all more like vicious animal things

those soldiers are moving in fast sir
data if youve got a theory about whats happening

think fast commander riker and move fast

those arent muskets

you have only one chance to save them now send them back to the ship
youll let me beam them
send them the same way as i do ive given you that power do you understand i have given you the power of the q use it

use your power

use your power



lieutenant take the conn position engineering this is the bridge
engineering here sir
engineering are all systems back online
back online sir they were never off
captain youd better look at this theres been no interruption in course or speed both have remained constant its as though we never stopped
we never did lieutenant q suspended time

wheres commander riker
he was with us
he must still be on the planet we were under attack by these these animal things
animal things
well maybe data could explain better sir
you may find it aesthetically displeasing sir i could just file a computer report on that
data
sir the important thing right now is why is commander riker missing
understood lieutenant but i suspect that commander riker is probably perfectly safe at least in a physical sense q has an interest in him in fact qs entire visit has something to do with our first officer
and the reason for that sir
i wish i knew q first became interested in him at farpoint i have no idea what it means meanwhile we must proceed with our rescue mission


something amuses you perhaps youll share the joke with me
the joke is you
strange gratitude from one who has been granted a gift beyond any human dream how can you not appreciate being able to send your friends back to their ship or sending the soldiers back to the nothingness from which they came certainly you must understand that at this moment you can send yourself back to the ship or to earth or change your shape and become anything else you want to be
what do you need q
need
you want something from us desperately what is it
want something from you foolish fragile nonentities oh come riker youre beginning to sound like your captain
now thats a compliment q but thats not an answer
riker we have offered you a gift beyond all other gifts
out of the goodness of your heart
after farpoint i returned to where we exist the q continuum
which means exactly what
the limitless dimensions of the galaxy in which we exist
i dont understand
of course you dont and you never will until you become one of us
until would you mind going over that again
well if youll stop interrupting me this is hardly a time to be teaching you the true nature of the universe however at farpoint we saw you as savages only we discovered instead that you are unusual creatures in your own limited ways ways which in time will not be so limited
were growing something about us compels us to learn explore
yes the human compulsion and unfortunately for us it is a power which will grow stronger century after century aeon after aeon
aeons have you any idea how far well advance
perhaps in a future that you cannot yet conceive even beyond us so you see we must know more about this human condition thats why weve selected you riker to become part of the q so that you can bring to us this human need and hunger that we may understand it
i suppose you mean that as a compliment q or maybe its my limited mind but to become a part of you i dont even like you
youre going to miss me

come on not again
commander riker whats going on i was sitting in school and
worf my phasers gone are you armed
no

where is q if you have any answer to any of this

worf

look out
wesley no

wesley
wesley
no damn it damn it to hell

riker you you did that
and thats not all


that grid their wounds only the q can do that
captains log stardate  twelve minutes out from quadra sigma three where the survivors of an underground disaster desperately need our help aboard the enterprise first officer william t riker needs help nearly as badly but this is a subject far out of my experience out of any humans experience

will how the hell do i advise you you know the implications as well as i
no one has ever offered to turn me into a god before
what the q has offered you has got to be close to immortality will theyre not lying about controlling space and time weve seen it in what they can do
youve also seen it in what i can do
if you are going to refuse his offer you must not allow yourself to use this power again its too great a temptation for us at our present stage of development
are you worried that i wont be able to say no to it
you tell me are you strong enough to refuse to use that power
certainly
no matter how tempted no matter how difficult q makes it for you
you have my word
good i know what your word means
in orbit of quadra sigma three sir ready to beam down rescue team to underground emergency area

this way sir

are there any others
gone its just us
commander  theres someone under here

youre getting close data

its too late shes dead if only wed gotten here a little sooner
sir if indeed you have the power of q
i dont understand certainly you cant bring her back to life
i cant im prevented from that by a promise

i should never have made that agreement with you i could have saved that child
you were right not to try once you became accustomed to that power number one
when i used it before what happened i saved most of our bridge crew
and when you grow to like it too much
as soon as its convenient captain i want a meeting with you and your bridge staff
as soon as we are secure of this rescue operation ill discuss all of this new power


we can confer here on the bridge if no one has any objections
the bridge will be fine since ive called the entire staff
correction number one knowing the decision you face i have permitted you this gathering
of course jeanluc

wesley this meeting is not for you
why not sir you helped make me a bridge officer acting ensign
all right he stays because ive been given unusual powers i am not suddenly a monster except for these abilities and i dont yet know how far they go im the same william t riker youve always known well everyone still looks uncomfortable
perhaps theyre all remembering that old saying power corrupts
and absolute power corrupts absolutely do you believe i havent thought of that jeanluc
and have you noticed how you and i are now on a first name basis number one will something has happened already
in what way havent you seen how much i regretted not saving that child using the q power to save her may not have been wrong no more than it was wrong to save the rest of you from those soldier things
lets keep in mind that that particular danger was invented by q
what we represent to the q commander are lowly animals tormented into performing for their amusement
actually they think highly of us tasha we have a quality of growth which they admire
or fear
no weve learned the q do not admire us the q has muddled your mind
dont you understand his incredible gift to me
are these truly your friends brother

let us pray for understanding and for compassion
let us do no such damned thing what is this need of yours for costumes q have you no identity of your own
i come in search of the truth
you come in search of what humanity is
i forgive your blasphemy
dont you see riker hes nothing but a flimflam man hes been that ever since we first met him at farpoint
flimflam
you offer riker jealousy what i offer him is clearly beyond your comprehension how can you claim friendship for riker while obstructing his way to the greatest adventure ever offered a human
obstructing him then its not yet certain hes not yet committed
the truly evil part of this captain is your jealousy  you love each one of your people demonstrate it you have the power to leave each of them with a gift proving your affection
thered be no harm would there if i gave them something i know theyd like
how touching a plea to his former captain may i please give some happiness to my friends sir please sir
in fact i authorise and support your idea riker please feel free to cooperate with him if you wish
are you certain sir
quite certain data by all means demonstrate your gifts of affection
dont be frightened there is no way i could harm any of you shall i guess your dreams
leave now wesley
no wesley i may know best of all our friendship our long talks
no please
have your favourite wish my young friend

youre ten years older a man
hey wes not bad
data
no no sir
but its what youve always wanted data to become human
yes sir that is true but i never wanted to compound one illusion with another it might be real to q perhaps even you sir but it would not be so to me was it not one of the captains favourite authors who wrote this above all to thine own self be true sorry commander i must decline
well my friend i know what you want

 youre as beautiful as i imagined and more
then we can throw away the visor
i dont think so sir the price is a little high for me and i dont like who i would have to thank make me the way i was please

proud warrior worf without a single tie to his own kind

no she is from a world now alien to me
worf is this your idea of sex
this is sex but i have no place for it in my life now
no place microbrain what possesses you
commander riker its too soon for this
if this is because your mother objects
no i just want to get there on my own honest
but its easier boy listen to riker
how did you know sir i feel like such an idiot
quite right so you should its all over q you have no further business here
human you have just destroyed yourself
pay off your wager
i recall no wager
im sure your fellow q remember you agreed to never trouble our species again just as theyre aware you failed to tempt a human to join you
 no if i could just do one more thing
q i strongly suspect its some explaining you have to do now

extraordinary
captain we are showing that same hole in time again our instruments say weve just now beamed back from our rescue mission
sir how is it that the q can handle time and space so well and us so badly
perhaps some day we will discover that space and time are simpler than the human equation no coordinates laid in number one
yes sir you have my coordinates la forge
aye sir on the board
engage
too short a season

captains log stardate  we are in orbit around persephone five where i have been sent to confer with admiral mark jameson in regard to an extraordinary situation


starfleet received this subspace transmission two days ago admiral
lets see it captain
on viewer

i am karnas governor of mordan four a dissident group of terrorists have taken federation ambassador hawkins and his staff hostage they will not discuss terms with me this is a crisis i cannot resolve the terrorists are demanding a federation negotiator i feel there is only one negotiator with the skills to resolve the situation the lives of the hostages will depend on starfleet delivering this man to mordan commander mark jameson admiral jameson the terrorists have given you six earth days to bring him here or the hostages will die
starfleet cannot understand how or why this situation has developed mordan four has finally gained peace after decades of civil war
forty years of civil war captain
yes sir karnas was largely responsible for the planets unification and peace why should he now be unable to deal with this rebellious faction
fortyfive years ago i negotiated a hostage situation on mordan captain karnas was a young man then but so was i he seems to feel that i can handle the situation again
im detailed to take you to mordan four as soon as you can be ready admiral
my wife and i will beam aboard at fifteen hundred hours captain acknowledge
received and acknowledged sir picard out
nearly fifteen hundred now sir
well number one lets go and welcome the admiral aboard


welcome aboard admiral this is my executive officer commander william riker
my pleasure sir maam
my wife anne captain there are certain details of this mission that you should understand before we begin
yes sir
i am not simply an advisor on any assignment i accompany starfleet has designated me senior mission officer i control the away team and all its actions is that understood of course captain you command the ship but the mission is mine i trust you are in complete agreement
yes sir of course

message coming in from mordan sir
put it on the screen mister data
mordan four to enterprise this is karnas i will speak to the captain
i am captain picard commanding the enterprise
is admiral jameson on board
hes here beside my first officer do you wish to speak to him now
so jameson i see time has not been kind
it seldom is karnas however we could save a good deal of it now if youll outline the terrorists demands
they insist all discussions will take place here on mordan they refuse to speak to me only to a federation mediator they say they will brook no excuses if there are any offered your ambassador and his people will die unpleasantly i believe them so should you admiral
tell them i accept the conditions of negotiation
i will do so immediately 
for a man in his position he doesnt seem to know much about the situation
wrong number one he told me that the terrorists are desperate enough to kill if theyre crossed they are willing to talk one on one but not to him
counsellor
from his body language as well as his words and tone id judge that what karnas said was honest but i sensed a holding back
perhaps he knows more about the terrorists than hes prepared to admit
possible but i suspect its closer to the mark if we said he doesnt want to admit failure of his own efforts to negotiate he is a proud man
that could be sir karnas has established himself as a powerful man on mordan suddenly in this situation his power is useless
sickbay to bridge im ready for admiral jameson now
in a few moments doctor
ready for what captain
just a routine medical checkup ships regulations

what i dont understand sir is how karnas knew you were still available
still alive you mean
so far as he knew sir you could have been dead
quite right commander but i am not and i imagine ambassador hawkins has told him that i briefed the ambassador about mordan before he left to take up residence
all right karnas has a problem he thinks you can resolve what do the terrorists need that karnas cant or wont give them
mordan has had peace for five years they have finally come to a state of productivity which satisfies their planetary needs but no more than that perhaps the dissidents feel the federation could provide them with more
i have negotiated many treaties on many planets picard ive found that peace or the appearance of it is often a prelude to war
admiral are you suggesting the terrorists want arms and weapons
they may i am suggesting karnas is the last man to give them such weapons
i see you believe that karnas would not negotiate on that point and so the terrorists demanded an outside negotiator
i know karnas he is a warrior he lives for challenge these people have insulted his honour by taking the embassy staff hostage ill negotiate but ill have to be very careful in dealing with karnas hell want revenge for that insult


well its about time couldnt get away from the bridge
didnt want to feels good to be on one again
im glad mark do you want me to help you up

youre stronger today
im fine i feel like a kid again
this ship is magnificent it even has family quarters pity we didnt have them twenty thirty years ago we could have been together almost all of your career mark  mark ill get sickbay
no theres no need its happened before
when you havent said anything
itll pass just give me a moment see im better its going away
what is it do the doctors know
just body changes last checkup they said id have to expect it
youre sure dont lie to me
im sure

all the medical information the admiral provided is satisfactory sir
excellent doctor
except for one thing the test results he gave me arent two days old theyre two months old the medical file coder always includes the date as part of the file number he lied to me sir and i dont know why
he is eighty five years old doctor for some the memory begins to fail
he suffers from iversons disease sir it affects the body not the mind no i have a gut feeling hes hiding something
that is an observation id expect from counsellor troi doctor doctor i do respect your opinion and ill want you on the bridge for the next day or so the admiral must remain in the best of health for these negotiations and he might require your services

admiral were approaching the idini star cluster would you like to take the conn as we make transit
thank you captain i would

well admiral quite a little surprise youve pulled on us
yes quite
neglected to mention i began some new therapy before i left seems to be working i havent felt this good since the last time i was in space the gettysburg all i needed to get me out of that chair was the thought of walking the decks in command of a starship again
admiral you only have the conn temporarily
a figure of speech of course shes your ship ill just keep an eye on her for a while

the admiral displayed a remarkable improvement out there wouldnt you say
captain no one recovers from iversons disease there is no known cure and there are no cases where it has gone into remission i have never heard of any therapy that would produce results like that
then how do you account for it
i cant all i can tell you is that the admiral has been confined to his support chair for the last four years by the effects of iversons by all the medical facts we know he should never have walked again
i want you to look into it doctor thoroughly
yes sir

the terrorists have given you six earth days to bring him here or the hostages will die
i dont know how much more information you think you can get from that tape  mark my god whats happened
its the new therapy im taking its working annie

oh darling

mark
i told you i just needed to get back into space again
you really are looking much better
its the new treatment
no come here
i hope youre heading for the bedroom
you stop it

darling you look like you looked twenty years ago
youre flatter me
now you tell me what the hell is going on
i dont know 
sickbay medical emergency in the admirals quarters

i found traces of chemical substances in his blood and tissue samples but none of them are in our pharmacopoeia im still working on alien references to substances like these all i can tell you is that hes ingested something thats strongly affecting his body
specifics doctor
captain there are so many things going on i cant give you specifics until i do a lot more tests
give me what you have now
his red cell count is running riot the cellular structure of his body is radically changing but we cant make any decisions on that until we know what its changing to his dna is skewed dont ask me how but he even looks younger and captain there are absolutely no traces of iversons disease
you said there is no cure for iversons
none that we know of but whatever these substances are doing to his body at least theyve done that for him but how or why its too early to say
get me some answers doctor as soon as possible
yes sir

captain
mrs jameson i have to ask the admiral some questions
ask away theres nothing to hide now

admiral in addition to your rank you are a particularly valuable commodity just now starfleet has a right to some answers
ive planned this for a long time ever since i learned i had iversons disease since it put me in that chair
what did you do mark
theres a planet in the cerebus system cerebus two they say the natives have a process that rejuvenates the body gives you your youth back
yes ive heard of that story its a myth
its true picard im living proof oh its dangerous the mortality rate is high and its very painful aliens are seldom allowed to obtain the process but i managed it i negotiated a treaty for cerebus two some years ago and they felt obligated to honour my request for the process
obviously it works very rapidly but how does it work
the herb and drug combinations are selfadministered slowly over a period of two years every response is different depending on a beings dna i got enough for both of us annie but i had to test it on myself first i couldnt risk you if i died well i was half a man so what did it matter
it would matter to me
but i was starting to change anne it was almost undetectable but the improvement was there then when this hostage situation came up i knew id have to be at my peak to deal with it i didnt have time to wait for the drug to work naturally
so you took the whole dose
i took both of them and look at me annie look at me im strong im alert fit im fitter than you are picard and im getting younger
the only question i have admiral is why you thought it necessary to be young to negotiate the release of the hostages even willing to put your life at risk for it ill be on the bridge admiral if you want to talk further

why didnt you tell me mark weve always been honest with each other until now
annie i did it for us
oh im sure you believed that until you had a chance to head up a mission to command again and then you just upended the bottle or whatever it was and damn everything did you think about me at all
i obtained enough of the dosage for both of us
but you never asked if i wanted it its just like you mark to assume that what you felt was right was the only answer
but it was the right answer for me it was killing you having to take care of an invalid annie what good was i to you we can be together again
let me go
i can get you another supply of the drug


commander data i wish to open a communication frequency to karnas

aye sir
one moment mister data admiral this is picard may i know the reason for this communication

karnas must have tried to negotiate with the terrorists before he was forced to call on me i want all the information he has access to

you said karnas was a proud man admiral probably sensitive about his failure to deal with this situation is it wise to press him on this

im the negotiator picard

karnas will have to cooperate with me and the terrorists and damn his sensitivities
then i suggest a secured channel admiral

a sensible precaution picard make it so

make it so
aye sir frequency open and secured

karnas
what is it you want admiral
were on a secured channel karnas you can talk freely whos behind this thing you said dissidents
yes political opponents who feel the federation will disavow me as governor if they stir up enough trouble on mordan
then who is it ardan gilnor
theyre dead jameson a long time now for a long time i thought you were dead too
i almost died a couple of times on missions but i always made it through somehow
yes now youre coming back to mordan to negotiate for hostages again its almost as though the forty five years inbetween never happened
youve never forgiven me
of course i have it was years ago
there are no dissidents are there no terrorists you have the hostages
and if i have youre coming to mordan jameson and youre going to negotiate for their lives and im going to ask a very very high price
what if i refuse
then the hostages will die youve seen how my executioners work they are still as efficient as they were perhaps even more skilled now youll come even if you dont have much honour left

conn are we still on schedule to arrive at mordan in thirty eight hours
aye sir were at warp four
picard i want a jump to warp eight so that we arrive ahead of our announced eta itll throw karnas off balance and we can catch him before hes ready
ready for exactly what admiral
i believe karnas has the hostages and there never were any dissidents
what has happened to bring you to that conclusion thats quite a big jump
im not at liberty to say picard but negotiations are no longer the answer
isnt the most important thing the hostages lives
and you agree with that too riker
i do sir
good because i plan to personally lead an away team on an armed rescue mission to get them out of there

commander data bring up the plans i requested on the viewscreen please
aye sir
most of mordans principal city was devastated during the war what was left consisted largely of a network of underground tunnels a rats maze when they rebuilt the city they simply built over the tunnels
i have it sir
pardon me sir but where do these tunnels come into the picture
this is where karnas held his hostages before and where i believe he has them now
wouldnt that be a little obvious admiral
karnas is a dogged strategist picard not a brilliant one he sticks to what works he will kill the hostages if we do not get them out of there
therefore you see this armed raid as the only option
you dont agree
with respect admiral i would point out no one else has heard or considered karnass demands the federation might view them differently if they knew what they were
starfleet has given me command of the away team picard and i intend to use them as i see fit

our anniversary is next week our fiftieth
in his heart hes still the same man you married anne
thats true he still cares for you despite the physical changes hes undergoing
but hes getting younger and im well look at me why did he do this
because there are lives at stake mrs jameson
what about our lives his and mine i was looking forward to time together finally our retirement now hes young again and has his life to live over
doctor she has to know
know what
anne your husband
what is it
hes not stabilising he may not have that life to live over


well be at mordan in three hours
i couldnt sleep either
i never could before a mission i always wound up in the observation lounge staring out at the stars thinking
perhaps in this case rethinking

why is this mission so important to you why did you risk your life to lead it personally
i want to save lives captain
noble sentiments but thats too easy an answer youve been here before you negotiated a release of the hostages with karnas before why is it now your answer is an armed raid its my away team youre sending in there i think theres something youre not telling me and i have a right to know what it is
do you know the background the mordanites had some sophistication but were still ruled by tribal family units karnass father was the ruling chief of one of the families another tribe had him assassinated karnas seized the passengers of a starliner and held them hostage demanding that starfleet provide him with weapons that would enable him to defeat his rivals
thats the official record
officially the story is that after two other mediators were murdered i went in and negotiated with karnas to bring out the hostages safely
are you saying thats not the truth
it wasnt my golden oratory that saved them captain i gave karnas the weapons he wanted
you did what
i gave exactly the same weapons to his rivals my interpretation of the prime directive let them solve their problems with those arms on an equal basis
and that decision plunged them into forty years of civil war
i didnt know that would happen i thought a minor war it would be settled in less than a year how would i know it would take four decades but i falsified the reports to starfleet and i lived with that on my soul picard sixtythree people came away safe but millions died on mordan because i delivered those weapons
karnas could have worked for peace during those years instead of continuing the war its not all on your head admiral
but i started it i lit the match now finally i can vindicate myself if only in a small way i came to negotiate but that isnt what karnas wants
revenge thats why he demanded you when he knew that you were still alive
and im not going to give it to him picard im going to do what i should have done the first time were taking the hostages out by force if necessary no deals


prepare to energise chief
belay that admiral your proper place is on the bridge
i will remind you one more time picard i am the senior mission commander and im leading this team
sir
the admiral is correct number one he has that right but i am the captain of this ship and i have a right to accompany him riker youre in command of the enterprise energise


yes perfect we are in the m tunnel directly under the governors residence m is a subsidiary tunnel but it crosses and links with several main ones
i am sorry sir that does not correspond with the information in my tricorder sir jameson your information is incorrect commander i know these tunnels like the back of my own hand keep scanning for signs of human life forms karnas held his hostages in these tunnels before hell do it again

captain the admiral is definitely incorrect the tunnel schematics we have show this to be a dead end it was sealed off two years ago
no doubt youre right mister data however forty five years ago im sure it linked in with the tunnels the admiral remembers

damn
geordi
this is steelplast sir fairly recent installation
this is the most direct route set phasers to cut through it

if you have the coordinates where you think the hostages are sir we could just beam in over there
karnas may not have them in the same place theres no substitute lieutenant for personal reconnoitre

admiral theres an infrared light signal ahead steady beam straight across the tunnel chest high theres another at waist level
an alarm trigger or
reset phasers to stun

take cover

sir look out

their phasers sir set on kill
thank you mister data i have heard the sound before

is he hit
no sign of a wound
enterprise this is picard six to beam up now

the admiral
sickbay not good is a galactic understatement
sir karnas again sir on screen
enterprise there has been an armed intrusion in the tunnels beneath the city that smells of jameson where is he
karnas this is picard im sorry to inform you the admiral is critically ill
that is not my concern sick or well you have ten minutes to beam him down
sickbay to bridge
picard
doctor crusher

requests your presence in sickbay immediately sir

im on my way

sickbay

what is it doctor
i think youd better see for yourself captain

picard picard i have to get to karnas
i cant allow him out of my care captain
its my last option picard the raid failed all i have left to bargain with is myself
bridge to picard
picard here
a new message from karnas sir

if we dont deliver jameson in five minutes one of the hostages will be executed

fifteen minutes after that another

he promises the method of execution will be most painful

let me go if i give myself over to him hell let the hostages go its me he wants
it means almost certain death for you admiral
my life for how many hostages picard twenty let me go
number one inform karnas well be beaming down in less than five minutes
did you say we sir
you have your orders number one

aye sir


who are you i want jameson
karnas this is admiral mark jameson
this charade will accomplish nothing picard beam down jameson and the hostages will be freed continue this and i promise you they will die and you with them
peretor karnas you always were a stubborn man i thought you wanted me im here release the hostages now
peretor was my old title why do you call me that i warn you picard this trick is going too far he has been coached for some devious reason if this farce does not stopped immediately you and the hostages will be put to death

doctor
i am waiting for an explanation captain
he is the admiral karnas before he left on this mission he administered an overdose of an alien deaging drug to himself he wanted to face you with strength again on even terms this is what the drug has done to him
this story you are telling is unbelievable jameson is a man of more than eighty years not this i want that old man picard i want to show him this world he helped to make the scars on old soldiers bodies the graveyards of our young dead the wasted cities we are still rebuilding and all of it caused by him
as i understand it karnas you were the one who demanded the weapons to avenge your fathers death
but jameson didnt give weapons to only us if he had we would have quickly triumphed over our enemies and there would have been peace in all these decades i want him to pay for that picard
captain i think mrs jameson should beam down now
enterprise this is picard have mrs jameson prepare to beam down karnas i asked doctor crusher to bring with her the visual records weve made of admiral jamesons deterioration will you look at them
youre wasting my time picard
just a few moments you saw the admiral on the enterprise when he was en route to mordan
yes
and you recognised him
yes
is this the man you saw

this is the man i want
hes here karnas look once he took the compound there was no way to stop it

youll have to deal with me karnas whatever you wanted from jameson isnt possible any more and you wanted revenge you blamed your war on him and theres no doubt he had a lot to do with it but you had the weapons and you used them you could have tried for negotiations for peace on your planet long ago instead you chose to fight how many of those forty years of civil war are on your head karnas
jameson has to pay for his crimes i have sworn it to my people
forty five years ago he made the wrong decision he wanted to come here to somehow right it to atone for what he did now all he can do is to give himself up to you he brought this retribution on himself
no i dont believe you youre shielding jameson on the ship and youre telling me this tale to save his life
peretor karnas there were only two of us in the meeting you didnt even trust your lieutenants there you told me that old peretor sain had ordered your fathers assassination you told me that you wanted arms to destroy him peace wasnt on your mind all you wanted was revenge and i gave you the weapons to do it
jameson told you this if it is you show me the scar

there the blood cut you gave me to seal our bargain
it is you somehow it is you  then die by your own weapon no no my revenge will be in seeing you live like this such pain
the compound he took is forcing his cells and organs to go further younger and they cant take the stress its like theyre imploding and i cant give him anything to stop it
can you ease the pain

mark can you hear me
yes
ill always love you
annie with the golden hair
flatterer its grey now
i see only the gold

rest jameson your long night and mine are over the hostages will be freed immediately captain im prepared to be cooperative

the hostages have been freed by karnas unharmed and the body of admiral mark jameson has been buried on mordan at the request of his widow and by the permission of karnas the quest for youth number one so futile age and wisdom have their graces too
i wonder if one doesnt have to have age and wisdom to appreciate that sir
i hope not number one mister la forge prepare to take us out of orbit set course for isis three
aye sir leaving orbit
the big goodbye

first officers log stardate  we are about to make a brief but necessary contact with the jarada a reclusive insectlike race known for its idiosyncratic attitude towards protocol the jarada demand a precise greeting in this case from captain picard their language is most unusual the slightest mispronunciation is regarded as an insult

unless its followed by
the double bars indicate an elongated s sound
and the inverted t means to hold the z
unless
unless its followed by three wavy lines in which case the z becomes a b
exactly
what a language
but you spell knife with a k
i spell knife with an n but then i never could spell
well this is an insect mind sir
my mind is barely working

captains personal log im delighted with how the holodeck has created the fictional world of dixon hill the twentieth century detective who has been a hero of mine since childhood the illusion is flawless the characters i meet are generated by the computer of course yet they feel real they seem real in every way

im not sure who wants me dead my husband my stepdaughter
or a lover perhaps
perhaps or perhaps its cyrus redblock i need you to find out name your fee

incredible

im going to go again only this time im going to dress the part why not come with me
yes id like that
i want to take that twentieth century historian
who whalen
yes whalen i bet he knows more about dixon hill than i do
shall i tell him sir
invite him mister data this is supposed to be a recreational activity the sense of reality was absolutely incredible when that woman kissed me it was so
exciting
real the subject of this meeting is the jaradan rendezvous mister riker will you go ahead with the briefing
this is primarily a diplomatic mission the jaradan are strategically important to the federation previous attempts have failed because they are so easily irritated a slip in the pronunciation of the greeting caused a twenty year rift
the captain has to recite the entire greeting without making any mistakes
simple as that huh
yes if on the other hand the captain makes even the slightest error
the captain is well aware of the gravity of the situation commander
we are all aware of the tape of the last federation starship to come in contact with the jaradan it graphically demonstrates what happened when that captain offended them
captain picard is familiar with that data
should we not rerun it
its not necessary mister data meeting adjourned

why would the captain not want to review all available information on the subject
data when youve seen the jaradan react once you dont ever have to see it again
this dixon hill is a most puzzling character
not really he was just a twentiethcentury sherlock holmes
ah but was his modus operandi not dissimilar worth investigating
indubitably my dear data indubitably

were running out of time

the jarada will expect the captains greeting
well you may have to stall them

its no use its just not there
suggestions mister data
i am at a loss sir we are in a holodeckcreated building of  the computer refuses to accept voice commands the controls for the environment are therefore not accessible
i could use some light


good day mister hill my name is cyrus redblock i hope you dont mind us dropping in

i see i have no choice
life is an endless stream of choices unfortunately you have chosen to make my life more difficult i dont suppose youd be foolish enough to hide it here
i dont suppose so
still im sure you wont mind if we take a look around
i wish youd quit asking since its obvious youre going to do it anyway its just a waste of time
good manners madam are never a waste of time civility gentlemen always civility get that stiff out of here
hes not dead
from his pallor he soon will be
you want i should throw him in the garbage boss
the room next door will be good enough for now
dont touch him
which one struck you
it was hill

for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction a newtonian truism which you have obviously neglected
dix you in there

i saw your light figured you were working late guess i was right nice company youre keeping dix you forget to take the trash out this morning

im a tolerant man but i do not tolerate disrespect
your devotion to etiquette is highly admirable sir however your methods leave much to be desired
what have we here
looks like a ghost
yeah where do you suppose hes from
where were you hatched anyway
i was created on a planet
data
south america
ive been all over this world and ive never seen anything like you
hes not from this world none of us are we are from a world were from a world of fabulous riches a world where there are objects far greater than the one you seek
thats ridiculous youre a private dick weve met before and you never even mentioned any of this
hes right dix thats pretty weak stuff i wouldnt even buy that line of guff
i am not dixon hill i just look like dixon hill
he speaks the truth sir from your point of view he is only a facsimile a knockoff a cheap imitation
thank you mister data
sorry sir that did not come out quite the way i intended
very very good what wonderful fiction quite entertaining i admire your skill at trying to obfuscate our sense of reality
it is you who are not real sir
data
it is you who are imaginary characters derived from a work of fiction
give it up fellas these guys are too smart to fall for that story
i am afraid you are not real either lieutenant
i dont want to hear any more of this youre making me crazy let me shoot them mister redblock let me kill them one by one
what an interesting situation perhaps we should test this theory by killing one of them
youve already done that this man is dying this whole thing is senseless
hardly senseless killing is immoral but killing for a purpose can be quite often ingenious
well said mister redblock what is our purpose
we are on a quest for knowledge mister leech we want the item
we dont have it
shall i kill him
no kill the woman
redblock i have the item
at last i knew it god man you are a character you are waiting until the last moment testing my resolve all right where is it
ill explain but first tell leech to back off
put the gun down mister leech
but i so much want to kill her
maybe later it wont harm us to listen to mister hill
dont make any deals with that slime dix

all right lets begin make your thoughts fruitful and your words eloquent because i dont have to tell you your lovely lady friends life depends upon it
there is a price
by god i knew you were a man of stripe all right what is it
mister whalens life you must help us to save him

we cant delay much longer
were going to have to tell them something open hailing frequencies
frequencies open sir
this is commander riker aboard the enterprise we demand that you  cut that off theyre not going to be satisfied with anyone less than the captain

la forge to bridge
riker here
we think we have something sir ill let ensign crusher explain
the biconverter interface has been affected

forget the explanation can you do it

i dont know if i should if this isnt done correctly the programme could abort and everyone inside could vanish

do you need more time to study it
whether we do it now or later the risk is the same
do it

if we can find away of getting him to our sickbay by fixing our computer
computer i dont know that word
an electronic or mechanical apparatus capable of carrying out repetitious or complex mathematical operations at high speed computers are used to control process perform or store
enough let me kill him hes really beginning to irritate me

captain the exit
thats it the way into our world
remarkable is this a twoway passage can one enter your world and return to this one simply by stepping through
oh yes allow us to help mister whalen and we will return with the item
you really are a scamp arent you do you actually think id stay here
if you were going to go through yourself sir that is not possible
one look at you sir is proof that anything is possible step back mister hill id shoot you myself but i dont want to deprive my assistant of his greatest pleasure after weve gone kill them all make sure the bodies are never found
youre insane you think you can kill a cop and get away with it

captain
are you ready sir
as ready as ill ever be number one open hailing frequencies
frequencies open

this is jeanluc picard captain of the uss enterprise aaaaard klaxon leeeeesss blag blan arnik kanik aaaaard krasulaaa rassss trassss trasulaaaah
you have honoured us with your words of greeting a new day dawns between us

so did you have a nice vacation
it was a nice place to visit number one but i wouldnt want to die there
so data how was it
it was raining in the city by the bay a hard rain hard enough to wash the slime
data
sorry sir
lieutenant take us out of orbit
aye sir
and mister la forge
sir
step on it
datalore

angel one

captains log stardate  as feared our examination of the seven year overdue federation freighter odin disabled by an asteroid collision revealed no survivors however three escape pods were missing suggesting the possibility of survivors

ready to begin orbit of angel one captain
make it so mister la forge what kind of place is this data
angel one is a class m planet sir supporting carbon based flora and fauna sparsely populated with intelligent life forms it is similar in technological development to midtwentieth century earth
kind of like being marooned at home
assuming any of the survivors made it this far admittedly it is the closest planet to the odin but to travel distance we did in two days at warp one would have taken the odin escape pod five months
five months fourteen days eleven hours two minutes
thank you data
and fifty seven seconds
captain were receiving an audio signal from angel one
starfleet are adamant that we maintain excellent diplomatic relations with this planet mister data is there any other pertinent information before we reply
angel one has evolved into a constitutional oligarchy it is governed by a parliamentary body consisting of six elected mistresses and headed by a female they refer to as the elected one
it sounds like my own planet
klingons appreciate strong women
how current is this information mister data
a federation vessel last visited this planet sixty two years ago captain
counsellor as this is a female dominated society you might wish to make the initial contact
thank you sir
open hailing frequencies
hailing frequencies open sir
this is counsellor deanna troi from the uss enterprise
 i am beata the elected one how may we assist you counsellor
the federation has neglected to visit to your planet for far too long with your permission we would like to correct that oversight
 we feel in no way neglected counsellor a diplomatic courtesy call is neither expected nor required
we also come in search of possible survivors from one of our freighters
 a brief visit will be tolerated
theyve broken off transmission
ever feel like youre not really wanted

wherere you fellows off to
our ski instructor has us scheduled for the denubian alps sir
save us some deep powder
no problem sir the holodecks have all youll ever need


the away teams ready sir
angel ones strategic importance in this quadrant may become vital starfleets hope is that one day this world may become part of the federation
well do our best to make a good impression sir
energise
captains log supplemental our away team has beamed down to an unusual matriarchal society where the female is as aggressively dominant as the male gender was on earth hundreds of years ago here the female is the hunter the soldier larger and stronger than the male an arrangement considered most sensible and natural


i am beata the elected one of angel one representatives of the starfleet enterprise do you wish to petition
we do we have reason to hope that survivors from a damaged federation freighter may be marooned on your planet we are seeking to learn if this is so
even a planet as remote as angel one has heard of starfleet searching the galaxy for survivors seems a petty task for one of their mighty vessels
we dont consider even one survivor petty
is this man implying that we put a lesser value on life than you do
not at all our discovery of the freighter was unexpected we have a duty to investigate
i see and if you find any survivors what then
we will take them with us and see that they were reunited with their families
are we to take these strangers at their word
good question
what reason could we possibly have to deceive you
another good question
are there survivors from the freighter odin on your planet
im not prepared to answer yet see to their comforts
 whats going on

you will remain here until summoned

is thus area secure can we talk
yes tricorder doesnt show any listening devices or anything else of a threatening nature
good troi
there was much fear in that room
paranoia id say but of what
i cannot say but their fear was not focused i sensed that all were not concerned for the same reason undoubtedly there are survivors from the odin on this planet
i agree otherwise why would they be so circumspect
as mistress beata is so fond of saying good question
what do we do if they deny the existence of survivors
lets not look for problems

i want all departments prepared for a warp six trip into the neutral zone as soon as the away team completes its mission
trouble captain
insurance romulan battle cruisers have been detected near one of our border posts


theyve requested assistance as soon as argh

report mister crusher
we finished our ski lesson sir and it kind of just happened
on the enterprise mister crusher nothing just happens what is that smell
hmm yes slightly reminiscent of night blooming throgni captain from home quite stimulating wouldnt you say
no
i dont smell anything im a little congested the snow
dont let this just happen again mister crusher
yes sir


interesting an alcoholbased synthetic artificially reproducing a floral scent
its called perfume data
the purpose of which is
certain cultures consider perfume an aphrodisiac
i am unfamiliar with that term
an aphrodisiac is something used to stimulate or enhance sexual pleasure
how does stimulation of the olfactory nerves affect the enjoyment of sex

the elected one will see you now


you claim you intend to remove these survivors from our planet are you prepared to give us your solemn word on that
we are
you should know that the vote was not unanimous some of those among us are suspicious yet the majority feel that we have no choice but to trust you
we dont understand the source of your misgivings mistress but we appreciate your faith in us
make certain that faith is not misplaced there are four survivors from the ship you call odin all male their leader is a man who calls himself ramsey
if youll deliver these men to us well have them off your planet immediately
if they were mine to deliver i would do it without hesitation unfortunately their hiding place has long eluded us
hiding place why are they in hiding
because they are fugitives on angel one and the quicker we get rid of them the better when these men came to us seven years ago they accepted our hospitality quickly enough but they gradually became restive started making unreasonable demands went against the natural order
using the technology of the enterprise we might be able to find these men
i assumed as much but be warned counsellor these men are dangerous


sickbay to captain picard
picard here
wesley and one of his friends have contracted some form of respiratory ailment
a respiratory aliment is it contained
i hope so ive isolated the twelve students who were on the quazulu eight field trip

how contagious is it

still running tests the key is to figure out how the virus is transmitted so far ive been able to rule out

person to person contact
well keep with it doctor starfleet has very important business for us as soon as the away team returns i dont fancy the idea of my crew being infected

data whats the best way to go about finding ramsey and the other survivors
if we can isolate something unique to the odin survivors perhaps an element not otherwise found on angel one we can utilise the enterprise scanners
mister data will need access to your library
our library is far too sophisticated for a man to comprehend
i am an android mistress although anatomically i am a male
an amusing notion maybe you could teach our males a thing or two trent see to the androids needs

bridge to captain picard
 go ahead lieutenant
the away team requests that we scan the planet surface for traces of platinum
 have mister la forge break fixed orbit and initiate a search pattern
aye captain geordi
search pattern initiated now


this was delivered for you
good its for my meeting with beata
youre not going to wear that
of course part of this mission is diplomatic i have requested an audience with a head of state and i will honour her by wearing indigenous apparel
i dont believe this youre going to put that thing on and parade around like one of them
why what is this attitude on kabatris i had to wear furs to meet the leadership council and on armus nine i wore feathers this objection doesnt have anything to do with the fact that beata is a woman and an attractive one does it


this is quite unnecessary doctor im fine
youre infected with the virus captain in my opinion you are no longer physically able to effectively command this vessel
that is ridiculous doctor i have an away team down there in less than friendly territory and in addition i have an appointment with several romulan battlecruisers
you have an appointment in your cabin captain with your bed
is that an order doctor
yes

i think i may sneeze
a klingon sneeze
only kind i know

lieutenant la forge you have command until further notice please make the proper ships log entries
aye sir

scanners indicate a platinum trace should i notify the away team
make it so

tasha

what do you think
well i got to say its kind of sexy
thank you lieutenant actually it feels quite comfortable


how handsome you look
thank you the enterprise reports a possible location for mister ramsey and the other survivors
so soon im impressed
i suspicious
you dont believe me
not yet i hear the words but not the sincerity
you had your opportunity to object ariel you were in the minority
after seven years the great ship enterprise come to repatriate a small group of insignificant people
mistress ariel i hear the words but not the sincerity
you should listen more carefully excuse me mistress i have matters to attend to elsewhere

with your permission wed like to begin our search immediately
by all means but im sure that counsellor troi and the others can do that without you if i recall you had a gesture of goodwill you wished to give to me
certainly that can wait until weve recovered the survivors
are you suggesting that the women in your party are incapable of accomplishing their task without the help of a man
not at all lieutenant yar and counsellor troi are completely qualified
youre very generous with your praise inform them you will remain here with me
riker to lieutenant yar

this is yar

in the interests of diplomatic relations ill remain here with mistress beata while you conduct our search

commander
you have your instructions

relax we have much to discuss


set phasers to stun
i wish they werent necessary
a justified precaution counsellor mistress beata observed that mister ramsey and his men are dangerous
lieutenant yar to enterprise
go ahead tasha
three to beam to the location of that platinum trace geordi
coordinates set
energise

tasha

welcome ive been expecting you

picard to bridge


la forge here

status report
eightytwo more reported cases of the virus sir doctor crushers converted the holodeck into an isolation ward
and the away team

well no recent contact sir but i have informed them of the medical situation up here and the growing romulan threat to our neutral zone outpost

keep me advised you have the bridge until commander riker returns

engineering reports a computer malf  im sorry im getting sick
im sure half the ship knows that by now report to sickbay lieutenant
engineering to bridge
la forge here
the computer wont accept the variant climate controls
on my way
with all respect lieutenant there are people to do that job now
la forge to engineering lieutenant wong knows the system im sure shell be able to resolve all problems worf thanks for the advice

how did you find me
actually it was quite simple angel one has no platinum enterprise scanners did the rest
platinum was it my wings i kept them for their sentimental value
where are the other survivors mister ramsey
oh theyre nearby theyre packing as a matter of fact since we can no longer remain here
seven years on an alien planet and i sense no anticipation no excitement at being rescued
what is it that you think youre rescuing me from my shipmates and i have all taken wives a few even have children you cant rescue a man from a place that he calls his home


why were you so hesitant at first to tell us about the odin survivors
simply because ramsey and his men are anarchists i had to make sure you werent here to fuel their struggle i like the way your eyes pick up the colour of your tunic
its not our position to interfere in the domestic affairs of other societies
but you can interact
of course otherwise how can we learn
is that why youre here with me tonight to learn
yes
about our society
yes
well in our society it is the men who are the fortunate ones enjoying all life has to offer while we women devote ourselves to the obligation of making life work
in our society we share the responsibilities and the pleasures equally which is why i am able to be here with you while the women of the away team go to find ramsey
youll have to remind me to thank them when they come back for giving us this time

you resist dont you find me attractive
yes i find you very attractive
you attract me like no man ever has
its not my function to seduce or be seduced by the leader of another world
its not the reason
no its not but will you still respect me in the morning
i hope so

thank you trent
you may go

compliments of the uss enterprise its called an albeni meditation crystal

very impressive and now i must repay you in kind

five months in a rescue pod no bigger than this room is an eternity i hope none of you will ever have to face when we finally made it here we thought wed died and gone to heaven youve seen the women of the planet theyre tall and strong and lovely but after the newness wore off we started to see how the men were treated theres no votes theres no opinions theres no respect
none of which is your concern any longer mister ramsey call the others in please its time to leave
despite their problems lieutenant we happen to like it here on angel one were not going anywhere
but mistress beata
mistress beata be damned her wish is not my command and neither is yours you cant force us to go
mister ramsey is correct counsellor the odin was not a starship which means her crew is not bound by the prime directive if he and the others wish to stay here there is absolutely nothing we can do about it

 bridge to sickbay how are you doing doctor
we have more sick than we do beds so far ive been forced to confine over three hundred to their private quarters

were going to be seriously undermanned if were forced to engage the romulans in battle

the romulans are your problem lieutenant trying to find an inoculants is mine this virus mutates every twenty minutes but so far we havent had any fatalities yet

if this continues therell be no one left to run the ship

if this continues lieutenant la forge no one will be healthy enough to care

 yar to enterprise
enterprise here go ahead

prepare to beam three to our previous location geordi after regrouping with commander riker well return to the ship

i suggest you make that on the double tasha we have a real medical emergency brewing up here

one third of the crew is down and the latest information from the neutral zone outpost is that more romulan vessels are converging on that area
ill inform the commander yar out one thing before we go you said you were expecting us why
i cant answer that
we wish you well mister ramsey
energise

theyre gone


what a refreshing change to be with a man who knows what he wants
and doesnt have to be told by a woman
exactly i knew you were bright enough to understand you see women by our very nature want only what is best for their men
men are not objects to be possessed mistress beata
of course theyre not it was merely a figure of speech

enter

what is so important you find it necessary to intrude upon my privacy
they have returned mistress but without ramsey or the others

your advanced technology has proven inadequate
what happened tasha
mister ramsey and the other survivors refuse to leave
you gave me your solemn word
im sorry theres nothing else we can do
im sorry as well since you refuse to take them with you i am left with no choice but to sentence them all to death


come
it looks horrible tastes worse and its absolutely guaranteed to make you feel better

i knew youd like it are you wearing cologne like something i smelled earlier something klingon
lieutenant worf and i detected the same scent when we bumped into your son at the holodeck
its that smell thats how the virus travels an airborne particle whose sweet scent inspires deep inhalation and once inside the body it becomes that damned virus i have work to do

you are excused doctor

whats the latest on the enterprises medical situation
doctor crusher feels the virus will undoubtedly run unchecked through the entire ship attempts to develop an inoculants have so far ended in failure lieutenant la forge still has bridge command pending your return sir
and what about the romulans entering the neutral zone
the border outpost reports a contingent of seven romulan battlecruisers within sensor range the uss berlin has answered the distress call however should hostilities erupt both the outpost and the starship will be outgunned it is felt that the enterprises presence in the area will be a vital show of force
some show of force the enterprise could fly on autopilot but with that virus knocking down our crew were going to be in sorry shape if things turn ugly
i think its time we to leave this place
it doesnt feel right to leave while beata is determined to execute those people
she has to find them first ramsey and his bunch have been fugitives for years i suspect hes pretty good at evading capture
somethings wrong

before you go back to your ship theres something i want you to see

we were no harm to anyone why did you tell them where to find us
you brought this upon yourself you and the traitor one does not need the technology of the enterprise to follow mistress ariel sneaking out to warn her husband let her stand with him now for tomorrow they will die together


you claim to be an advanced society and yet you resort to executions in order to suppress those who dont share your views
i dont expect you to understand
why because im only a man
youll accomplish nothing with that attitude
mistress beata if you had an alternative to the execution of ramsey and his followers would you take it
is that not the way of an advanced society
then let us meet with the men from odin one last time let me try to convince them to leave with us
will you also include those from this world who unwisely choose to follow ramsey and his group
yes all of them

mistress beata is willing to give you a second chance were prepared to take your entire group with us
thats very kind of you but were not going
havent you been paying attention ramsey youre scheduled to be executed tomorrow
we dont want to die we dont want to leave either
theres no time to debate the issues youre going with us whether you choose to go or not
excuse me commander but removing any of these people against their will would be a violation of several starfleet regulations not the least of which would be the prime directive
i realise that mister data id rather face a court martial than live with the guilt of leaving these people to their deaths commander riker to enterprise
this is the enterprise crusher here
it must be worse up there than we thought
doctor where is lieutenant la forge

hes right here but hes in bad shape
notify the transporter room i have fourteen to beam up
i cant allow it

this virus is totally out of control here until i know exactly what im dealing with i cant let anyone new be exposed
doctor these people are facing their deaths down here

they might be facing the same thing up here until i have a better idea of what im dealing with no one can beam up im sorry will but you must wait

understood doctor would this virus have any effect on mister data
not likely
youre going back there alone i want you to get the enterprise into the neutral zone before its too late
this is data standing by to beam up

what of them
i dont know deanna

mistress beata invites you to witness this mornings reaffirmation of angel ones moral imperative
is that the civilised word for murder on this world
you send mistress beata our regrets
the elected one will not look fondly upon
 enterprise to commander riker
theyre still here
riker here data i gave you direct orders to get to neutral zone immediately explain the delay

to be precise commander you ordered me to reach the neutral zone before it is too late

after relieving lieutenant la forge i computed the length of time the border outpost

and the uss berlin can safely withstand a romulan attack and deducted our time to destination at maximum warp speed that leaves doctor crusher forty eight minutes to develop an inoculants to the virus

which means theres still time for us to do something
fortyeight minutes

forty seven sir

perhaps data perhaps thank you

for following my orders so precisely data

on second thought trent we would be honoured to witness your moral imperative in action

 we have determined that the heretical teachings of ramsey and his followers are inconsistent with harmonious life on angel one our patient efforts to silence revolutionary voices have failed therefore we are left with none but the most final alternative

as you can see we are not without compassion your deaths will be swift and painless
mistress beata before we see living examples of your compassion may i speak
is this a plea for leniency
nothing of the sort as the governing body of angel one youre entitled to execute your laws or your citizens as you see fit
make your point so we can proceed with this unpleasant business
when you spoke of the prisoners you used the term revolutionary indeed death has been known to stop revolutions but i suspect its not a revolution that angel one is hoping to stop its evolution mister ramsey and the odin survivors did not initiate the waves of dissent that are rippling through your planet their presence here merely reinforced the change in attitudes between men and women that was already well under way they became symbols around whom others who shared their views could gather you may eliminate the symbols but that does not mean death to the issues which those symbols represent no power in the universe can hope to stop the force of evolution be warned the execution of mister ramsey and his followers may elevate them to the status of martyrs martyrs cannot be silenced

beata
stop we will adjourn to consider your words

thank you
i dont know if it was enough

 sickbay to bridge
go ahead doctor
bingo data
bingo i fail to see the relevance doctor is that not a reference to an ancient earth game

its also a reference to success data ive got the inoculants

excellent doctor we still have seventeen minutes left i will inform the away team immediately enterprise to riker

we are ready to have you beamed up commander
data ramsey and the prisoners are with us in the great hall i want you to lock the transporter prepare to evacuate the entire group

but for now stand by
understood commander


after careful consideration this legislature has voted to stay the execution of the prisoners their children will be returned to them immediately do not rejoice prematurely ramsey and his followers are to be exiled to a distant and unpopulated region life will be difficult there with little time for revolutionary or evolutionary upheaval as some have observed we may be able to stop evolution but perhaps we can reduce it to a slow crawl for a man you can be very clever commander riker
riker to enterprise belay my previous order mister data there will now be only three to beam up energise


welcome home
its good to be back
are they recovering
slowly but yes
and the captain
 the captain is fine thank you mister data has been briefing me on the away teams comportment number one
we improvised sir
i look forward to your reports
dont we have a call to pay on the romulans captain
indeed we do mister data set course for the neutral zone warp six data coordinates set warp six on your mark sir
 engage
sir

engage


captains log stardate  the enterprise has been ordered to starbase  in orbit around tarsas three a routine maintenance check of all systems will be made and certain upgrades completed including the holodeck with which weve had problems i anticipate a glowing report the ship has performed magnificently beyond anyones expectations


coming into position
stand by to dock
ready to dock sir
engage mooring beams and lock off
aye sir  and docking complete
thank you number one well done and well done all

starbase maintenance approaching airlock five

commander quinteros request permission to come aboard
granted welcome
captain
commander riker

commander youre late we expected you a week ago
we were unexpectedly delayed at omicron pascal
is there anything specific you wish to report or that we should be aware of
no we are very pleased with the operation of the enterprise
i knew you would be  i was in charge of the team which put her together
and are these gentlemen the bynars

theyre not gentlemen or ladies commander they are a unified pair theyre always together this is one zero  and this is zero one  they just finished upgrading the computers on the wellington did a great job
your reputation precedes you im very pleased youre going to be improving our system
it is a great pleasure
to work on such a large mobile computer
you have forty eight hours because at forty eight plus six we have an appointment at pelleus five we must keep
i thought wed
have more time
im sorry this mission cant be delayed if you want to postpone the work
oh no this is
the best time
to do it
we can complete
our work within the
time allotted
they work very quickly but itll be very tight
commander riker and i will stay on board be available should you need us
thank you captain i dont think well need you until were ready for inspection

the bynars seem perfect for this even though this is the first time ive ever come in contact with them
as i understand it over time they have become so interconnected with the master computer on their planet that their language their thought patterns have become as close to binary as its possible for organic beings
itll be interesting to see how they improve a computer as advanced as ours

bridge well i have a little work to finish up then im going to my cabin im going to put my feet up im going to turn on my personal relaxation light and im going to lose myself in the pages of some old novel what about you number one youve earned a rest
ive never been very good at organising my time off somethingll turn up it always does


ill be in my ready room and number one good work
i thought there were only going to be two of you
because of the limited time allotted us
we need others
is there a problem
no
no no problem
then why are you acting so excited
because we have to
the stacking
to reconfigure the computer
to communicate with itself
more efficiently
and at higher speeds

you act like you dont believe them
im not sure that i do maybe its probably nothing
perhaps its just how another species behaves
maybe im going to stroll the ship youve got the bridge keep your eye on them
yes sir


weve been challenged to a friendly game of parrises squares by some of the maintenance personnel want to join us on the starbase
youve already got all the players you need
we can switch off
no you know if you do that in parrises squares you lose the rhythm of the game
i cant talk you into coming with us
no but win all right the pride of the enterprise goes with you
rest assured commander we will be victorious at whatever the cost
worf its just a game a little friendly competition you work up a sweat you have a few laughs and you make new friends
if winning is not important then commander why keep score
i think hes pulling your leg believe it or not worf is developing a sense of humour
i hope so for their sake

computer theres a power reduction in section lninety four explain
unoccupied sections are being closed down in order to clear space in the main computer banks it is necessary to facilitate the system upgrade full power can be restored if needed


well what do you think
tell me what its supposed to be then ill give you my opinion
it is an attempt at pure creativity
what were investigating is can data be creative
and this is my attempt with guidance from geordi
i suggested the zylo eggs
is that what those are
keep notes this project might turn out to be of interest to scholars in the future
really
well of course think about it a blind man teaching an android how to paint thats got to be worth a couple of pages in somebodys book

you look like youre packing to leave forever
oh commander riker no im just gathering my notes professor terence epstein is at this starbase
is that someone i should know of
hes the leading mind in cybernetics he lectured at my medical school you know the disaster at micromius

well since then ive been working on an approach that combines cybernetics and regeneration it sounds impossible i know but i have found an approach which will work i mean what an opportunity to have a chance to talk with doctor epstein sorry will id love to chat but i have to go


hows it going
 we are almost done
 the deviation
caused by a previous
probe has been corrected
you may use the equipment
anytime you wish
how much has been changed what exactly did you do
enhancement
nothing more

would you like to try
the enhancement
all right what should i choose computer id like some place to play some music a little atmosphere
specify
jazz
era
circa 
location
kansas city no wait new orleans bourbon street bar new orleans around two am
programme complete enter when ready


very good very good indeed now ill need someone to play with a trio piano bass and drums and a bone for me

now an audience whoa too many i was thinking of something a little more intimate

great job boys but computer blondes and jazz seldom go together  now that is truly exceptional but more sultry

gentlemen if this is what you call enhancement youve got a gift for understatement

whats your name tell me you love jazz
my name is minuet and i love all jazz except dixieland
why not dixieland
you cant dance to it
my girl whats a knockout like you doing in a computergenerated gin joint like this
waiting for you
waiting for me you cant be serious
oh yes will ive never been more serious in my life


can i ask you a question about the bynars
why not just ask them
what is that highspeed sound you make
that is our
primary language
how can you process information at that speed
we store the information
with these buffers

we receive information
all the time
and save it
until we need it
how did you happen to develop this ability
it happened over
a long period of time
to have a society so intermixed on computers has tremendous advantages
and a few
disadvantages

everything under control ensign crusher
fine captain i was just trying to find something about the bynars
wheres commander riker
hes in holodeck four shall i call him for you sir
no ill go down there myself keep me apprised
yes sir


hey man the chick digs you
what makes you say that
hey look at her
maybe its my music
yeah well about that dont give up your day job
too real
you got that straight slim too real is too right
thanks for letting me sit in
aint nothin to it
im going to have to leave for a while to see to my duties
your works very important to you
it is me its what i am
can we dance once before you leave
sure why not  how did you learn to dance so well
from following you i can anticipate your lead so tell me about your work what is it about it that consumes and enthralls you
interesting choice of words thats exactly what it does
youre very fortunate
i know that
to be exactly where you want to be and its great that you realise it
id be a fool not to realise how lucky i am to be on this ship serving with these people its like a dream come true just like this
a dream is that what this is is that what i am
i know you are a computergenerated image but your smell your touch the way you feel even the things you say and think seem so real
thank you
how far can this relationship go i mean how real are you
as real as you need me to be

astounding
captain
oh im sorry number one i didnt mean to interrupt
no its all right come on in
you picked a wonderful locale this is something i might have chosen myself
arent you going to introduce me
captain picard this is minuet minuet captain jeanluc picard
enchantee comme cest merveilleux de vous voir ici
incroyable vous etes parisienne
au fond cest vrai nous sommes tous parisiens
oui au fond nous sommes tous parisiens the spirit of that city can always enchant my soul
i have been hoping to meet you
oh have i been the subject of conversation
indirectly come join us jeanluc a glass of wine
thank you
will was saying how much he enjoys this assignment its a credit to you for a ship and crew to function well it always starts with the captain you set the tone
at the moment its you who are setting the tone the sophistication of this programming is remarkable
in what way
the holodeck has been able to give us woodlands and ski slopes figures that fight and fictional characters with which we can interact but you youre very different you adapt you spoke to me in french
it was very simple when i heard your name i merely accessed the foreign language bank
thats very impressive
oui mon chou


now what are you doing
i am awaiting inspiration
commander data
this is commander data go ahead please

im getting an indication of possible trouble in main engineering sir

can you be more specific

im afraid not im reading a problem with the magnetic containment field which contains the antimatter could you come up here

well go to engineering since thats where the trouble is wes dont disturb the captain or commander riker until we check this out

aye sir

bridge this is main engineering
this is the bridge
are you running any test programs up there
no
are the bynars
not to my knowledge is there a problem
i dont know theres no one on duty here and were getting some very strange readings from the magnetic containment field
the field is deteriorating contact the captain immediately i am initiating red alert
data i cant maintain the integrity of the containment field
engineering to captain  if the antimatter is released the ship will be destroyed
nothing i do has any effect im losing it data ive rechecked every circuit this is not a misread by the computer
computer situation analysis
 estimate release of antimatter in four minutes eighteen seconds seventeen seconds sixteen seconds
engineering to bridge

this is the bridge

alert starbase inform them we are abandoning the ship tell them why initiate automated sequence for departure set course and speed course and speed to put maximum distance between the enterprise and any inhabited planets

shouldnt we wait for the captains approval
there is no time

based on all information presently available the decision is correct this is lieutenant commander data speaking for the captain abandon ship this is not a drill all personnel this is not a drill  i say again abandon ship all personnel this is not a drill

abandon ship


decks two through four to cargo transporters decks five through ten proceed to transporters one two three and four decks six through sixteen proceed to transporters five six seven eight nine and ten


hold your positions please prepare to energise and energise
decks seventeen through twenty eight proceed to transporters eleven twelve thirteen and fourteen

decks twenty nine through forty two proceed to transporters fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen and twenty this is not a drill this is not a drill


whats going on
please stand out of the way
the enterprise is being evacuated
why
some problem in engineering
get a security team together
aye lieutenant
ships log supplemental this is lieutenant commander data i have put the ship on automated departure and ordered the complete evacuation of the enterprise everyone remaining is leaving on foot or beaming off

computer where are the captain and commander riker
 all decks empty
curious the captain is usually the last to leave
lets go weve only got forty one seconds

i think were the last
i hope we are


did you see the captain and commander riker
no are they not here on starbase
no we thought
you mean theyre still on the enterprise
yes sir where is your transporter room
we have to beam back and get them
you havent time
this is starbase  the enterprise magnetic field is regenerating
wait a minute how is that possible
unknown
that changes nothing the captain and commander riker must be in trouble or theyd be here
look your ship is almost clear



and the boy never found out
oh yes but not until later when he came back into the room with his little sister
ill bet both of them were all smiles
yes but by that time both of them had been found out
you handled that in a very thoughtful way youre very good with people dont you agree jeanluc
shes so very different from the images weve experienced on the holodeck isnt she shes more intuitive
its as though shes been plugged into my subconscious she already knows what i want her to say before im aware of it myself
i suppose its an understandable progression computers make decisions based on inputs and we humans give off a multitude of subtle signs that communicate our emotions
its uncanny i could develop feelings for minuet exactly as i would for any woman
doesnt love always begin that way with the illusion being more real than the woman
oh jeanluc spoken like a true frenchman
well i think ill be leaving
oh dont go
twos company
we have time theres no rush id really like it if you would stay
yes captain stay
this is your diversion number one not mine
wait we havent danced
i dont dance
then some more wine
no thank you
wait please please dont go you cant not yet
why whats the matter why cant he leave
exit

captain to bridge situation report
riker to bridge
computer explain red alert
initiated as a programmed response the magnetic field containing the antimatter had weakened there was no failsafe available
why wasnt i notified
unknown
present condition
the magnetic field is now restored containment is restored propulsion is at maximum efficiency
locate lieutenant commander data
not on board the enterprise
explain
all enterprise personnel except the captain and first officer have been evacuated
evacuated was the condition that critical
yes
are we still docked at the starbase
no
position report
coordinates four one five nine point two six by eight one nine two one by three one two heading two three three mark four five
destination
planet bynaus in the beta magellan system
the bynars
am i to understand the bynars have stolen the enterprise
that information is not available
its the bynars and youre part of this
yes
they made you the lure to keep me here they programmed you while i was relaxing
yes when they saw your interest in me they thought i could distract you and keep you here
that explains riker what about me
your being here was just a fortunate happenstance
why do they want with me
what do they want with the enterprise whats their purpose
im not programmed to give you that information
come on number one weve got to regain control of our ship

okay so what do we do
which is the nearest starfleet vessel
the trieste
i know the trieste too small too slow
plus its sixty six hours away
where are the bynars
i havent seen them
they are obviously still aboard another starfleet vessel must be sent to intercept the enterprise at bynaus they might be taking the ship to their home planet
what makes you think so
it is the best place for us to start

 picard access

captains log supplemental we now know who has commandeered the enterprise the bynars we cant communicate with the bridge commander riker and i will now try to regain control of our ship

this way
thats toward engineering
thats our first stop verify containment and initiate autodestruct
initiate autodestruct
our ship has been commandeered by a force of unknown size and intent were here alone we must assume the worst

if we dont regain control then no one else must have it either now this is the one decision involving the operation of this vessel which requires you and i to be in total agreement
its the time allotted that concerns me
as to that theres no option
i know its a five minute countdown
thats sufficient to get to the bridge once there either well get control of the ship and shut off the autodestruct or we wont this vessel must not fall into hostile hands
then lets set it and get going

 recognise picard jeanluc captain recognise riker william t commander
set autodestruct sequence
does the first officer concur
yes set autodestruct sequence now
autodestruct will detonate in four minutes and fiftynine seconds
the only place we can stop this is on the bridge lets go

what do you make of this sir
an enormous amount of data is being received and stored in the main computer
just stored why
its another piece to of puzzle

bridge access denied
theyve locked it off we must find another way to get in
one of us could beam into the bridge
no it takes several seconds to materialise you wouldnt stand a chance
i could beam into the turbolift force the doors take them by surprise
no well both beam in simultaneously in two different areas of the bridge with luck one of us will be a distraction
there must be only four minutes left

still no response from the enterprise
they would answer if they could someone else has control of the ship
do you think i am responsible
responsible how could you possibly have known
my station is on the bridge
you cant be on the bridge every second data
you are wrong geordi i can i do not need rest or diversion i should not have been painting i was negligent
its a pointless discussion data you could have been on the bridge and it still might have happened commander quinteros you have three ships in here we need one of them now
were rushing repairs on the uss melbourne but its still eighteen hours until shell be ready theres nothing else you can do

set coordinates for main bridge port forward for me and aft for you
youre on pad two ive set a ten second delay
set phasers on stun number one good luck


over here captain
why did you steal my ship
please try to
help us

cancel autodestruct
 does the first officer agree
affirmative
autodestruct cancelled
were in orbit around bynaus how are they
they appear dead lets see if we can get some answers from bynaus
their main computer is off all sensors reveal that all of the equipment on the planet is inert they can neither receive nor send any messages
what about all the people in that world who are totally dependant on their computer are they still functioning
theyre probably like these bynars here dying what is this all about why did they steal the ship and bring it here what is their purpose
they went to an awful lot of trouble to clear computer space lets see what theyve stored
captain its enormous every byte of free space in the computer has been filled they must have made a coredump from their world to our computer i cant get in i wish theyd left a note
maybe they did
minuet
maybe


tell me what this is all about
a star in the bynar system went supernova and they miscalculated the electromagnetic pulse from the explosion was going to knock out their main computer
so their only choice was to transfer all the stored information and shut down until after it passed and then reactivate their system and transfer the information back to this main computer
the enterprise has the only mobile computer large enough to handle all that information
so what went wrong why are they dying
the star went supernova before it was expected and you were late arriving at starbase 
why didnt they say something why didnt they just ask for help
i dont know i dont have those answers
is there anything we can do
yes return the data stored on the enterprises computer back to the one on bynaus
how can we do that
you dont know
yes if we had the file name but we dont do you
i dont know what youre talking about
they wouldnt intentionally hide it or make it difficult for us to find it must be right in front of our faces
we should call starbase  and see if anyone can decipher this
theyre dying they meant you no harm it was their world they were trying to save help them will hurry please

starbase  this is the enterprise do you read me

this is starbase  captain picard what is your situation

well go into that later right now i must speak to lieutenant commander data
i am here sir
data the bynars have stored an enormous amount of material in our computer we need to access it we cant

the access would be available by code or password

yes i know that data but what could it be

file names can be anything sir

they want us to find it they would have kept it simple

then a name or a place it could be something personal in this case in binary language which is ones and zeros in groups of eight or sixteen characters

 would they have kept it that simple try it picard out

thats the file itll work now
now access the file start the transfer

so much for that idea
let me get on the other position the bynars always work in pairs maybe that is also required it appears to be successful their systems started up a resident diagnostic programme is running their system is absolutely incredible

our world
is reactivated
our people
express their gratitude
we will return to
your starbase for whatever
punishment your system
requires of us
why didnt you just ask for our help

you might have
said no
but there was a very good chance we would have said yes
our need was too great
to risk rejection
so you stole it
their reason is part of their binary thinking for them there are only two choices one or zero yes or no why did you lure me to the holodeck and hold me there
because we knew we might die
and we needed someone
to restore our computer
and you did
no one has been hurt you have achieved your objective you have your planet back in order we have our ship well its been some time since i had the conn but not to worry number one youre in good hands starbase  warp two engage everythings under control

uss enterprise has cleared the starbase perimeter


is everything all right
were fine everything is in order but now i want a complete check all systems all divisions
what about the bynars
turn them over to quinteros there will be a hearing
we understood that
would happen
follow me please
while these things are being checked permission to leave the bridge sir
permission granted

what is a knockout like you doing in a computer generated gin joint like this

youre not minuet

shes gone i tried variations of the programme others appeared but not minuet
maybe it was all part of the bynars programming but you know number one some relationships just cant work
yes probably true shell be difficult to forget
home soil

captains log stardate  while mapping the pleiades cluster weve been asked by the federation to visit a group terraforming velara three communications have been erratic and there is some concern about their welfare

entering standard orbit now
it takes very special people to live in such desolation
visionaries who dont see this planet as it is but as it will be
ive always wanted to see terraforming in operation
lieutenant yar hailing frequencies
hailing frequencies open sir
velara three base this is captain picard of the starship enterprise 
no malfunctioning equipment on either side sir they are receiving us
velara three base this is the enterprise come in please over
maybe no ones home
we are sensing lifeforms sir
velara three base do you copy

velara base to enterprise yes captain im director mandl im sorry about the delay but we werent expecting visitors
terraform command has asked us to see how you were getting along
we were a little behind but were back on schedule id like to hope wed be allowed to maintain that schedule
we alarm him for some reason
your staff is all well i presume director
understandably tired were working very hard captain
if there anything we can do to help you and your staff are welcome aboard for a change of scene rest
we have some holodecks which you might enjoy
no disrespect sir but we cannot afford the time
channel closed
his fear is escalating
if you will excuse me sir i really must get back to work
i sense deliberate concealment sir
of what
i dont know but its intense
 director mandl weve heard of your remarkable achievements in terraforming my crew would very much appreciate looking around
this is not really the best time we are at a very critical phase just now
we would require no special attention
im trying not to be rude sir but this is really very inconvenient

he is concealing something its more than just being too busy your announcement about coming down has sent him almost to a point of panic
well whether he wants us or not  director mandl unless youre absolutely refusing permission for us to land at your station prepare to receive our away team
as you wish
counsellor perhaps youd better go along as well
aye sir
someone that tense could be very unpredictable stay on your toes number one


welcome to velara three please i want you to remember it as it is now because in a couple of decades you wont recognise it luisa kim gardener of edens
commander william riker uss enterprise this is counsellor troi lieutenant yar lieutenant la forge lieutenant commander data
arthur malencon hydraulics specialist  and bjorn benson chief engineer 
an android
and third in command of the enterprise
where were you manufactured are there others like you
both matters are subjects of protracted discussion
remarkable excuse me

we dont get many visitors its exciting to have you here
we werent sure how we would be received director mandl was less than enthusiastic about our interest
i should apologise for him we are at a critical phase usually hes quite charming
well try to stay out of the way weve never seen a terraforming station and we appreciate the opportunity
how much do you know about the process
theories reports but nothing firsthand
oh wonderful let me show you what we do newcomers find this
the other two are secretive but she is as open as she appears
what were doing is so exciting so inspiring we take a lifeless planet and little by little transform it into an m class environment capable of supporting life terraforming makes you feel a little godlike the first phase involves selecting the planet thats very important it must have the right mass and gravity the correct rate of rotation and a balanced day and night the planet must also be without life or the prospect of life developing naturally the federation determines if thats so then we take over this station is phase two phase three involves water usually we create basins using hydraulic landscaping but the water on this planet is subsurface and extremely high in salt content we are just about to begin pumping and filtering the water removing the salt oxygenating and replacing next we introduce microorganisms and when the process is complete eventually well have a lush arable biosphere

you make it sound poetic
i think its the best job in the universe
the efficiency of your hydraulic landscaping is quite elegant
it isnt yet but it will be right now im disturbed by erratic power surges in several of the servomechanisms that control the hydraulic probes
could it be the increased conductivity caused by the high saline content
that was my first thought but i
arthur the factors do not support that conclusion

im director mandl and im sorry about having been so abrupt during our initial contact being isolated one tends to forget the social graces are you seeing everything that you want
what youre doing here is miraculous
what we are doing here is working a difficult and demanding timetable and there will be no miracle unless malencon here gets the hydraulic probes back on line we are set to step up to full conversion immediately shouldnt you be in the hydraulic chamber arthur
now
yes
all right kurt
geordi this appears to be the master subsurface pump
youre right very impressive
this is interesting the water table is a thin ribbon between the sandy surface layer and the rocks below
and those two surfaces follow that contour so precisely the water maintains a consistent depth between them
which would require extreme precision from the probe controls
here we have something which may be of interest to you a vegetation graph it is really the key centre for successful terraforming
incredible its planned month by month decade by decade
every single thing is specific and exact you see grand romantic concepts i see unyielding rock under an ocean of sand
commander
what is it deanna
malencon hes in trouble
help help argh

can you open it
its jammed

first officers log stardate  what began as a routine visit to a terraforming site has turned into something far more serious arthur malencon the hydraulics engineer has been critically injured by a laser drill which appears to have malfunctioned

situation report number one
for safety reasons were shutting off all power to the hydraulics room before entering to recover the body then well beam him up to sickbay but from the look of his wounds its probably hopeless
keep me informed
data 
go ahead geordi

all set
data we have your section completely powered down now bensen has just locked the master servomotor drive system

laforge  so it should be safe in there now
im going in
i will go with you
transporter room this is lieutenant yar two to beam up to sickbay

i want to go we should be with him kurt please come too
transporter room this is commander riker beam up four at my coordinates


geordi this is intriguing i have seen malfunctions

but this is almost as if the laser drill seemed to operate itself with a will

separate from its control console
i cant explain it

the laser blasts seemed to end when the yelling stopped

maybe arthur stopped it only not in time

not possible

then what are you suggesting

uncertain geordi please return power to the control console in this room i wish to reactivate the programme

you got it


i am running the base drilling programme


geordi servos off
they are off
data whats happening
too much to explain

can you open that la forge to enterprise we have a problem

be specific

datas in the hydraulics room alone and were hearing laser blasts

get him out of there

its not working again
weve got to get this door open data we cant get in data data data


away team now what is happening

im going to beam him out of there
bridge this is lieutenant commander data no need to beam me up sir the situation is under control
are you all right
yes
what happened did you do anything which might have set it off
no but the firing programme was dynamic
the firing programme in what way
it adjusted to my tactics it tracked with me anticipating a fixed programme could not have done that
are you suggesting that someone was controlling the aiming and firing sequence
that is exactly how it appeared there was a mind working against me
what did you do to this laser drill a years work destroyed

i had no choice

we were attempting to trace the source of the malfunction when it attacked me
how much more of this useless fantasy must i listen to
none at all mister mandl until this is sorted out ive provided temporary quarters for you and your staff perhaps youd like to make use of them
youre overstepping your authority picard you have no right to interfere
mister mandl an attack on one of my crew gives me the right
i have a schedule to meet
your schedule is on hold until i have a satisfactory explanation of this director mandl lieutenant yar would you escort the director to his quarters
aye sir

go on with your report
it would appear the lasers drilling system was reprogrammed sir as soon as its memory bank received power it turned itself on and went after me fortunately i was able to cope with it
and not by much from what i saw
i believe it was programmed to destroy any person moving in that room sir
certainty or speculation
certainty
that would have required the talents of a master programmer
but it was done
and so the question becomes not who since it clearly was one of the three remaining terraformers the question becomes why what are they hiding what could be so important that one or all of them could be desperate enough to kill
shall i have them brought in sir
not yet

malencon
i couldnt save him the injuries were too severe the damage too extensive
the entire velara three facility has been powered down captain
weve just completed a remote power feed to the life support systems
good data i want you and geordi to return for more careful inspection
what are we to look for sir
evidence of tampering negligence sabotage whatever the answers there on the planet tasha i want you to provide counsellor troi and me with complete personnel records on our three guests psych profiles training everything im looking for motive intent the psychological capacity to commit one murder and to attempt another
aye sir
it seems we are becoming detectives number one


not much left of this drill

geordi i need some visual assistance
whoa what is it nothing but basic elements inorganic no carbon sandy texture those flashes are almost musical i see colour variations and rhythms in complex harmonies
speculation could it be alive
how could it be alive its inorganic
whatever it is it could be what they are covering up and the reason someone killed malencon
captains log supplemental on my order datas startling discovery of a possible life form has been beamed aboard so that its true nature might be uncovered but unlike life on earth and elsewhere it appears to be completely inorganic


a test for inorganic life
its never been done doctor
there are basic definitions for organic life must have the ability to assimilate respirate reproduce grow and develop move secrete and excrete
would any of those apply here
perhaps growth and development
reproduction
yes those two may be basic for any definition of life organic or inorganic
well doctor youre charging unknown seas how do we proceed
as were dealing with a fundamental question lets use the basic scientific method observe theorise and attempt to prove it activate lets be sure of what were dealing with is the sample organic
negative carbon negative known life components substance inorganic
recheck analysis please
rechecking analysis verified not organic
magnify to screen factor five hold surface factor ten

what are we looking at
its really beautiful whatever it is
whats that hum
it started after doctor crusher ordered the scanner to magnify
computer demagnify resume normal scan

everyone stand back

step back again

its us
yes were causing it why
unknown but it is definitely reacting to our presence perhaps it is picking up the electrical impulse of our systems
the flashes havent changed could the hum be connected to the flashing
computer magnify what is the magnification
twenty five hundred diameters
analyse the pattern of the flashes
not repetitive or sequential pattern not recognised
what is the source of the flashes
unable to specify theoretically not possible from this substance
disregard incongruity and theorise as to source
life

what do you mean a life form what life form a federation recon expedition certified velara three lifeless
understandable given this particular life forms novel nature
what is that nature
doctor crusher is still making her determination mister mandl you know the prime directive
are you saying that i knowingly defied it
thats what i have to find out youre a man obsessed with what you do who knows what an obsessed man will do to keep going kill perhaps
i create life i dont take it

you hit him pretty hard captain
what do you think counsellor
it was useful i felt two levels he did know about the life form but the idea of murder seemed to shock him whether it was the whole idea or just being accused of it i cant tell
what about his file lieutenant yar could he have accomplished the reprogramming that data says took place
mandl holds advanced degrees in computer science as well as artificial intelligence its possible
what about the others including the victim
only the victim had the required expertise malencon did work where the whatever it is was found trying to suppress that knowledge would be motive for murder if mandl were obsessed enough
terraformers are often obsessive it frequently goes with the career profile
how do you read the designer
shes possessed of highly abstracted reality lovely visions little data you might do better than i


its not locked
mind a visitor
is it true did you really find a life form
the debate is still going on in some quarters but i think so yes
whats it like
we have nothing we can compare it with its microscopic it seems colonial simple but its inorganic which is why the recon scouts missed it it was not your mistake
everything ive worked so hard for is falling apart
luisa its very beautiful i could arrange for you to see it if you like
perhaps later


captain this is doctor crusher i think youd better come to the medical lab

what is it
geordi observed movement
not movement exactly but a definite shift in the energy pattern
without external influence
the hum has gone too why
unknown sir perhaps it is scanning us
scanning us why what could it hope to learn
unknown at this time sir
its changing
i dont see anything
the infrared range is increasing
warning input overload
the hum is back
it is projecting an energy field
and its intensifying
magnification deactivated

two of them
only life can replicate itself doctor inorganic or not it is alive
activate quarantine field  quarantine field full full shield backup

evacuating lab
translation request being patched
translation from whom

evacuate

whats wrong on with the translator circuit
bridge this is the captain request emergency power to initiate lab quarantine seal

do it mister worf
aye sir
whats the nature of the problem captain weve lost visual

we have confirmed that datas discovery is life but more than that it is intelligent life

how do you know sir

its trying to communicate with us
captains log supplemental the inorganic life form from velara three has apparently taken over our medical lab

it generates enough energy to interfere with the surrounding systems
mister la forge can we see into the lab yet
negative captain reducing the backup to the quarantine seal might help
doctor
i wouldnt
continue quarantine
aye sir
director mandl and the others are in the observation lounge as you requested
counsellor i shall need you you have the bridge number one

director mandl i put it to you again what do you know about these life forms
not a thing
enough sit down lieutenant you are deliberately evasive and it must stop you have kept information from me since our first communication an alien life form has taken possession of my medical lab you knew of its existence
yes
is this true you knew there was life on velara three
i knew that there were random energy patterns yes i knew that but not life not by any definition i have ever heard
but you tried to keep that knowledge from us
no they are meaningless silicon crystals which rebroadcast sunlight
it is a life form and it has intelligence
why do you say that
its trying to communicate with us
communicate with you
when did you first become aware of them
tell them about the pattern in the sand
oh yes do tell us
when we first arrived we noticed that in certain areas the sand had a sparkling effect like sunlight bouncing off new fallen snow
what did you think it was
honestly we did not give it any thought
picard i must point out again that we were assured not once but many times by the best scientific minds in the federation that this planet has no life no life and we were not looking and therefore we did not see
all right at first you dismissed it but then you began to understand that there was something that was different about them
you cant know that
your apprehension suggested it when we first arrived tell me about these patterns
at first we thought it was just a natural phenomenon unique to velara three
refraction and a thin atmosphere is interesting but certainly not life
why was i never told about this
because its not particularly important
as the building of the terraforming station went forward the patterns in the sand ceased being random and became very specific geometric shapes suddenly appearing disappearing changing location changing size
did you ever feel that these patterns were attempting to communicate
no never
bensen
i dont know at the time i didnt think so but now after hearing what you just said now i dont know
captain weve regained magnification of the life form its divided again
patch visual to observation lounge

there was no indication of any of this on velara three
absolutely none


i cannot understand the patterns
neither can i
please show me the spectral analysis magnification twelve k
silicon germanium
transistor material
gallium arsenide
emits light when charged
cadmium selenide sulfide
emits charge when lit
water impurities sodium salts
conductor but is it alive
probability positive
i wasnt asking you
engineering to bridge
this is commander riker go ahead

the backup on the lab seal is fluctuating sir i think you should come down here

on my way data youve got the bridge inform the captain

status ensign
the quarantine seal is getting weaker every time i try to redirect backup it goes somewhere else i think ive no its locked three people in a turbolift and two more in the programmers rest room
if that reading is right there is no seal give me lab interior image
yes sir
magnify

picard this is riker

we see it too number one

get that seal back up

sir no matter what i do the energy goes somewhere else what if it hits the sickbay or nursery
hold off impossible captain

we havent got the power
captains log supplemental the life form which has significantly increased in size is again attempting to communicate with us

the universal translator is coming on line sir
ugly ugly giants bags of mostly water
bags of mostly water
an accurate description of humans sir you are over ninety per cent water surrounded by a flexible container
life force do you understand us
we understand we ask you that you be gone we call we talk you not listen
we didnt hear you we come in peace
ugly bags of mostly water we try at peace you still do not listen bags who drill in sands of home have to die
it killed malencon
we see and hear you now we didnt know you were there you are beautiful to us all life is beautiful
bag in dome did know caused much death made us kill war is now with you
the translator is now offline sir
can you hear us now  mister la forge
restabilising captain
sir that chaos when we were studying it in the lab must have been the energy surge of a reproductive cycle it is now a colony of single cells which organize as a computer and like any computer
more is stronger

captains log supplemental we have regained visual contact with the lab but our attempts to restore communication with this microbrain as we have come to call it has been unsuccessful one thing that is certain however this life form has declared war on us

their range of influence appears to be concentrated in the medical lab captain
all nonessential personnel have been moved to the most distant areas of the ship sir
data any analysis of those bolts of light it emits
that seems to be its method of reprogramming captain each bolt of light consists of negatively and positively charged ions a series of programme instructions as it were it seems to have a quicker rapport with our computers than we have
what do you expect it is computer
have we disabled the medical lab computer console
aye sir as soon as data determined the microbrains method of operation
captain picking up a decrease in infrared intensity
maybe the lifeform has reached its energy level
or maybe thats not the end of it with singlecelled life forms at least organic ones cell division is preceded by a resting state
the calm before the storm
medical lab on main viewer lets use this calm
it does seem dormant captain
tasha set coordinates to beam it back where it came from
coordinates set sir
energise

transporter power being redirected sir we are unable to affect it
life form or not intelligent or not  the safety of this ship and everyone aboard her is my primary responsibility data evacuate all the air from the medical lab i want a vacuum there
environmental systems fail to respond to command captain it appears the microbrain has successfully interfaced with our computers

observation lounge
picard if it did try to communicate with us we didnt understand that
it has declared a state of war and we are on the defensive we have no control over our medical lab nor our computer at this moment it has the power to destroy this ship and everybody on it i need your help
unbelievable
it said you killed some of them i need to know how
i dont know
what was malencon doing when he was killed
there is a very thin layer of highly saline water under the sandy top soil he was siphoning that off
perhaps somehow that saline water sustained them
it connected them
i dont understand
the microbrains may be like our own brain cells individually a cell has life but not intelligence yet when interconnected their combined intelligence is formidable
the saline fluid is their circuitry and to prevent its loss they killed malencon
if we had continued to remove that water we would have destroyed them all
reason enough for anyone to go to war
captain its happening again i think youd better get in here


if this keeps up it will tear up the enterprise
what can you determine mister la forge
captain our sensors indicate that the microbrain expends a tremendous amount of energy during its reproductive cycle yet there is no discernible power drain on our own systems
then what is feeding the damn thing
we found traces of cadmium salts now cadmium is a conduit for converting infrared into electricity
meaning
meaning the microbrains might be photoelectric
kill the lights in the medical lab mister la forge lets see if darkness will neutralise it
sorry sir it still has control of the computer we cant do it by remote
number one light
the life form must have evolved at that narrow layer where the light got through the sand to the water drop the water a centimetre below the light penetration level and they starve

killing lab lights now

its slowing down
its getting dimmer too
more light please
only if you will talk to us
we die bags of water kill us you are like others
we have no wish to kill you we never have
you do not say truth
we will end this war if you will end the war
darkness death terrible must go home to wet sand war over
agreed we will send you home to your wet sand picard to riker bring up the lights in the lab just a bit  are you better
better
we mean you no harm do you believe me
yes
good it is important that you trust us
not yet you are still too arrogant too primitive come back three centuries perhaps then we trust
we understand what you are saying we will leave you we will send you home

riker to transporter chief pick up the coordinates of the bell jar in the medical lab for return to velara three
coordinates entered sir
riker to bridge captain were ready to beam it back to the planet

i wish we were able to learn more about them sir
in time mister data when were better prepared
i wanted to create a place where living things could thrive and all the while i was about to destroy the life that is there
our apologies
and respects lieutenant yar
coordinates set sir
energise
captains log stardate  i have declared an indefinite quarantine for velara three and we are now returning to starbase with the three surviving terraformers perhaps the lesson we have learned from this near tragedy will prevent it from happening elsewhere
when the bough breaks


commander riker report to the bridge
on the way
harry harry come back here

whats your hurry harry
sorry commander i was just

harry im sorry if he bothered you
no bother doctor bernard
im not going back i hate that teacher and i hate calculus
everyone needs an understanding of basic calculus whether they like it or not
why

youre limping
had a small runin with an aspiring sprinter
number one
problem captain
no more a curiosity for the past few hours weve been tracking faint energy readings in an attempt to locate the source its like following a trail of bread crumbs the pathfinder lead here and stopped which is what i knew would interest you
whats our position geordi
the epsilon mynos system sir
thank you captain youre right i wouldnt miss this for anything
whats so interesting about this system
aldea tasha im surprised you havent heard the stories about aldea the wondrous mythical world like atlantis of ancient earth or neinman of xerxes seven advanced culture centuries old selfcontained peaceful incredible technical sophistication providing the daily needs for all the citizens so that they could turn themselves over to art and culture
where is it supposed to be
thats the myth somehow as the legend goes the aldeans were able to cloak their planet in darkness and go unseen by marauders and other hostile passersby who might rob and plunder
what a wonderful fairy tale
scanners still show nothing sir
scanners may show nothing sir but im sensing something very strong thousands of minds
from where
very close
all stop and hold this position
aye sir all stop and hold
anything
captain im recording a distortion in quadrant one mark nine zero
on screen

shields and deflectors up
aye sir

its aldea captain it has to be
captains log stardate  either by chance or intent weve been led to the planet aldea which appeared out of nowhere hidden behind a sophisticated shielding device

sensors indicate that the shield is electromagnetic a complicated light refracting mechanism
a cloaking device
aye sir
its got to be pretty sophisticated to hide an entire planet 
were being scanned sir
well let them know our peaceful intention open hailing frequencies lieutenant yar
frequencies open sir

i am rashella welcome to aldea
i am jeanluc picard captain of the uss enterprise we come in peace
we know
weve heard the stories about aldea but frankly i never believed they could be true
our shield has confused outsiders for millennia captain
thats a very long time to have such technology why do you reveal yourselves to us now
were eager to meet in person to discuss that and other subjects of mutual interest
were ready anytime
excellent

we mean no harm
our arrival seems to have startled you
it was a little sudden
im radue first appointee to aldea
welcome aboard
captain they havent been through decontamination
our medical doctor is concerned that you didnt go through the regular transporting procedure
you couldnt transport us the only way through our shield is our way captain our cloaking device may be off but our shield is operating weve brought you small tokens of welcome

and a personal invitation to a celebration on aldea
that would be delightful number one assemble the away team
we will prepare for your arrival commander riker
how do you know
your name weve been monitoring your ships communications we must return now to aldea our eyes are very sensitive to bright light rashella

amazing to exist only in that dreamworld of mythology and then suddenly to be here right in front of us
now we know who placed the bread crumbs were not here by accident
counsellor do you sense anything
they want something from us something we value greatly so much that theyre afraid we wont part with it
we are ready to receive you commander riker and two of your colleagues

interesting choices

i hope duana and i know how to greet you properly commander

how do they cloak the planet
the theory is simple the shield bends light rays around the planets contour similar to the romulan cloaking device but the implementation is quite difficult

captain
data what do you read
some sort of scanning device sir

dont touch him
this beam is emanating from aldea
shields up la forge contact commander riker worf check all decks
shields inoperable sir
all decks being probed in a methodical pattern sir
all decks everything the entire ship
aye sir
i cant reach the commander were being blocked

wesley are you all right
it was scary at first but i really didnt feel anything
sir similar incidents all decks but only with the children

yes we are an ancient power commander but weve suffered for it our history is littered with the deaths of those aldeans who wanted more and more things nothing was ever enough so weve evolved a very simple way of living for whatever is taken something is given in return
it seems an equitable code
its brought us peace unfortunately there are very few of us left to enjoy it
why
that is part of what we wish to discuss we need help from the federation to rebuild our heritage we need a younger generation strong and healthy following in the aldean traditions
i dont understand how can the federation help influence your children in your traditions
because we have no children commander rashella was the last child born on this planet
and your medical community can do nothing
theyve tried doctor crusher and failed
perhaps we can help
radue exactly why were we invited here
we propose a trade one which will solve our problem and give something back to the federation
and the nature of this trade
we need some of your children in payment we will give you information that would take you centuries to acquire
that might be acceptable to some other races but humans are unusually attached to their offspring
our children are not for sale at any price
we sympathise with your situation but what you ask is not possible
and thats your final answer
thats my only answer now if theres some other way we can help you
i am sorry you are intransigent


still no response sir

wesley theyve taken my son

captain saucer section reports six more children are gone
its the children thats why weve been brought here thats what they wanted
and thats what they have status
aldean shield still up hailing frequencies open no response
keep trying counsellor youll have to gather the parents
theyll need to speak to you as well captain
captain your children are with us my word of honour no harm will ever come to them
harm has already come to them
captain let us begin discussions regarding appropriate compensation
compensation you have stolen our children away from their classrooms away from their bedrooms and you talk about compensation you claim to be a civilised world and yet you have just committed an act of utter barbarity
captain we will continue these discussions when youve calmed down

 wesley im frightened
i know you are katie we all are but were going to be all right everyone knows where we are and no one is going to hurt you i promise

greetings wesley crusher the custodian indicated that you would be the leader
the custodian who is the custodian
the custodian is not a person
you have been brought to aldea as our guests well provide anything you need or want
we want to go home
wesley all of you have been chosen because you are special just ask for anything you want and you shall have it


whats happened to alexandra and the other children captain how are you getting them back
toya sit down dont give in to fear now we all knew what the risks were when we signed on and thats the choice we made now captain picard will do everything possible to bring our children back
the aldeans are anxious to discuss compensation
compensation
that will buy us time ive asked doctor crusher to be involved in the negotiations as your representative
why were these specific children taken
we cant be sure we do know the aldeans cant have children of their own
then they wont let them go easily
i wont insult you by pretending that any of this will be easy but i can tell you that the enterprise will not leave them behind you can be assured of that
can we talk with our children give them some reassurance let them know that we are here and that they will be safe
ill do my best to arrange that
the last time i saw him i yelled at him

there you are i have you now



come in dont be alarmed the other children have been assigned to their units
units
a unit is a group where those of similar talents and interests live together
do you mean like a family
yes you could call it that
we already have families does captain picard know youre doing this
we are keeping nothing from him
we have been waiting for you so long harry we are artists just like you we see within you the potential of what you can be
im not an artist
you will be and a great one
this way  unit b three seven five

katie
 i am honoured
thank you
melian is the foremost musician on aldea
music speaks its own language i know well have much to learn from each other dont worry katie youll be seeing wesley soon

what about me dont i get a say in this
wesley sometimes something happens which you just must accept you and the other children are now members of this society that will not change it is up to you to make the transition as easy as possible for the others its your duty because you are their leader help them to accept it because nothing you or those on the starship can do will change it because like you we also have no choice

where have you been rashella zena and aran are waiting to take alexandra
no
no i told you that she
no radue they cant have her i will never let her go

any response from aldea lieutenant
not yet sir
captain data has found something interesting the aldean shield gives evidence of random fluctuations weakening its structure in isolated sections
youre saying there are holes in their defence system
in essence yes i find it surprising after all these eons that the aldeans have not perfected their technology one would assume they would be aware of the weakness and repair it
can we beam down an away team through one of those holes
its a possibility it would have to be perfectly timed and theres no guarantee
we may be more successful in deciphering the code they use to transport through the magnetic shield
can you do that
eventually sir i am working on it now but the number of permutations is almost endless
keep trying while hes doing that number one i want you and la forge to try and find some way of getting through one of those holes because one way or the other we have got to get an away team on the planet locate the power source for the shield and neutralise it
youre certain theyll negotiate
oh theyll negotiate or theyll call it that theyve taken what they want now theyll rationalise it by throwing us some sort of bone
and when we dont accept their offer
the minute they believe that we wont accept their compensation for the children theyll break off the discussion theyll disappear behind their shield locking us out and the children in forever thats why ive got to keep them talking


custodian wesley crushers voice will be entered into the authorised file for third level clearance
proceed duana
announce yourself to the custodian
hello custodian i am wesley crusher
hello wesley your voice will now activate third level clearance
what does that mean
you may ask any questions you wish
thank you duana what does the custodian do
it frees us from all burden it takes care of all our needs it regulates our lives
who built it
the progenitors
when
oh hundreds of centuries ago
what is its power source
wesley why is that important it does what we ask it it always has what difference does it make how it works
if you dont know how it works then how can you repair it
why would we want to repair it
from time to time every computer i mean custodian requires maintenance
wesley radue is right you ask questions i cant answer ask the custodian instead
custodian can you show me where harry is
yes
custodian show me harry

i never did this before its fun
you are going to make him into a sculptor
he already is he was just never encouraged properly the tool leda is giving him will allow him to bring out his visions
it will take him years to learn to do that
oh no it will happen quite quickly
custodian show me alexandra

custodian show me mason
stop custodian we must work now there is much to learn

whats in there the power source
i dont know its forbidden
captains log supplemental we remain in orbit around aldea its becoming all too evident that talk will not effect the return of our children we must neutralise the aldean shield until then we are helpless

sir radue is hailing us
captain picard
doctor crusher and i are ready radue
are you ill captain
no doctor crusher is a staff officer radue starfleet regulation six point five seven requires that at least two staff officers are present during any treaty or contract negotiations
very well
not much on pleasantries is he
i am not aware of regulation six point five seven
no data neither am i
i see sir oh i see sir
doctor crusher please report to the bridge now well see what they have in mind

before we begin we want to see the children
no were here to negotiate appropriate compensation not to pander to emotions please sit
we do not condone your actions youre attempting to salve your conscience by offering goods in exchange for our children
why do you want them back so badly you can always have more
you are trifling with the primal instincts of our species i must warn you that human parents are quite willing to die for their children
returning the children is nonnegotiable
i promise you theyll have a beautiful life with us and theyll be father and mother to a new breed born of an ancient culture
but how can you be so sure that they can have children you cant
but they will our inability to bear children is a genetic dysfunction its not contagious
we sympathise with your situation surely there is a solution which can be mutually satisfactory
for us the problem is solved and were offering you information on areas of the galaxy you do not even know exist what more can we offer what more would you like
a significant beginning but first i must ask that doctor crusher be allowed to see her son before we continue
you are a stubborn people ah well that too can be a positive trait you may see him


mom
wes

i knew captain picard would get us home
not yet wes

oh
are you okay and the others
okay really okay weve been assigned to our units like families theyre treating us like gods

dont let it go to your head
i wont

wes seems fine he says the other children are too
of course theyre well
captain picard you have our offer it is final rashella

captain we want you to understand the nature of your choice a small demonstration of our power
what was that
i believe it was a repulsor beam
position report
this is unbelievable sir according to my calculations were three days from aldea at warp nine
and they call that a small demonstration
geordi get us back to aldea warp nine
aye sir
captain if you dont accept our terms the enterprise will be pushed so far away that by the time you return your children will be grandparents
captains log stardate  we are twenty hours away from aldea and no closer to a solution their deliberate show of force pushed us out of orbit and could have easily disintegrated the ship


now hold it a little bit more firmly thats it perfect now think no thinks not right feel the notes inside your head

im sorry did i break it
no its all right you cant break this
it did exactly what i thought i mean felt
yes its a direct expression of the music within now we just have to teach you to structure that feeling try it again

that was beautiful now play something happier
thats not the way i feel i dont want to do this any more

you see harry i told you you were going to be an artist
are you sure did i really do this
oh yes your talent has always been there the sculpting tool is just helping you develop it its what you were meant to do
you mean i dont have to take calculus anymore
you dont have to do anything you dont want to do whats calculus
nothing important can i do some more
captains log supplemental it has been three days since the aldeans pushed us away we have had no contact with radue since then

open hailing frequencies lieutenant yar
frequencies open sir
radue this is picard
welcome back captain what have you decided
that there is room for discussion radue
we will bring you down when we are ready
data find a way to defeat that shield
that may be impossible sir
things are only impossible until theyre not
yes sir

captain heres what ive learned so far duana is dying i have no reason to believe the rest of the aldeans are any healthier theyre suffering from some kind of chromosomal damage it could be genetic or environmental
and is that why they cant conceive
yes it also explains their lack of appetite extreme pallor and sensitivity to light
an entire civilisation thats terminally ill is it reversible
i wont know until i find the cause and you dont need to tell me time is running out
good work doctor

have the lesions gone
yes the medicine worked again
good come see what harrys doing beautiful

yeah it really turned out well
it is so alive and graceful what do you call it
its a dolphin
dolphin
you know it swims in the ocean like a fish only its not a fish
ah a fish we used to have them in our oceans ive never seen one before
i used to live near the ocean on zadar four my dads an oceanographer he says that never mind it doesnt matter

i want mommy i want mommy

you havent eaten
you didnt eat anything
we need very little
i know you miss your family but you will grow accustomed to us i promise youll be happy
we were happy before we came
we are offering more especially for you
duana i feel badly for you that you have no children but i have to tell you that we dont want to be here and we will not cooperate

no that doesnt fit the pattern give me a list of the appropriate medical literature from the twentysecond century theres not enough time
is there anything i can do
you just did jeanluc now i have to get back to work


custodians room

custodian this is wesley crusher
proceed wesley
show me where the enterprise children are in relation to this room thank you goodnight
good night wesley


i think i know a way to get us home i need your help
chief medical officers log stardate  ive begun to suspect that whatever is killing the aldeans is related to a danger faced by earth in the twenty first century can it be that aldeas ozone layer has been weakened

why will not talking or eating make them send us home
its called passive resistance we dont do what they want us to do and then they wont want us
will they get mad at us
they wont hurt us
but wes i do kind of like them
so do i but i dont want to stay here forever do you
no but i like working with the wood
harry we all have to be in this together or its not going to work
okay ill do it
what are you all doing here together

what is going on here

ive got it captain the aldeans are suffering from a form of radiation poisoning
is that what made the aldeans sterile
yes
is it reversible
with the proper treatment yes
captain
sir
these permutations are going to take a very long time
how long
weeks
there is the option
we were able to further define the weakness in their shield now its not a hole as much as it is a fluctuation
if the timing is precise its possible to beam through and onto the planet
why dont we just beam the children up through the hole
the timing would be more difficult and the risk greater
all right you and data beam down locate the power source of that shield knock it out ill delay the aldeans until youre ready

will you at least eat

no alexandra
why
we cant eat i know youre hungry we all are but its our way of telling them that we want to go home understand
yes


were ready lieutenant worf

captain you may come down now to conclude our discussions or your ship may leave its your choice
doctor crusher and i are prepared to conclude our negotiations

transporter room now



this is it commander it is programmed to accept only authorised voice command
theres no way we can override
no but i can scramble the input so that nobody else can

before we begin captain you must speak with the children it seems they are on some sort of strike i dont understand it you must deal with this captain im not very good with children
strike ill see what i can do

im sure if we just stick together guys well all be

hi captain picard
hi captain
sir i knew youd come
its not over yet wesley
i think i figured out their computer controls sir but im not sure its a much different system than ours
good wesley now
captain
yes harry
if something happens and you have to leave us here will you tell my dad that im sorry that i made him angry and that i miss him
you will tell him that harry and i will tell him how much i admire his son hello alexandra
 hi



what is this
they want to go home
no theyre staying
number one
were in position
hold for orders
the radiation levels on aldea have been building up over a long period of time it is similar to what was experienced on earth in the twentyfirst century when the ozone layer had deteriorated and the surface of the planet was flooded with ultraviolet radiation
the shield that protected your world in one way is weakening it in another it is the radiation of your own sun that is destroying you
youre trying to confuse the issue
please listen youre all suffering from radiation poisoning sterility is only the latest symptom if the children remain they will be affected as well
its impossible our scientists would have known
how could they your scientists have forgotten how everything works
no all lies
no wait dont send them back yet what if theyre right instead of the children being our hope what if were just condemning them to our fate
rashella theyre just protecting their own interests
as are we but hear them out the captain and doctor crusher are saying that the very thing which has given us this wonderful world is what has caused this tragedy
thats it exactly your custodian has controlled you so completely youve lost even the desire to even question it
lies and the discussion is over

commander riker
here sir
i assume you have control of the computer
weve disabled the system temporarily

we found the power source to the shield and weve neutralised it

good enterprise this is picard beam the children up
wait
enterprise hold
thank you
let me get the dolphin for you to take with you
no you keep it ill make another one
all right harry
yes captain
okay kids lets go home
beam them up

you have destroyed us
we are not here to destroy you radue we can help you


what is it
a legacy of your progenitors radue the source of your power and of your problems
it is reading incredible amounts of energy sir even more since we have taken down the shield
what are we going to do with it
learn all over again all this time weve been destroying ourselves so sure of our technological invulnerability now we must learn to use this power safely
will you let us help you
yes please

dad i want to be an artist but i dont want to take calculus anymore
you can be anything you want harry anything but you still have to take calculus
okay thanks dad

it worked well sir we have successfully reseeded the ozone layer but for their atmosphere to maintain its integrity they can never use the shield
or be cloaked again

are you finished
yes captain and theyre responding very well to the treatment
the legend will die but the people will live
and we know theyll make good parents

wesley
sorry captain she just wanted to thank you for bringing her home to her mother
thank you 
come on

mister la forge out of orbit warp five
yes sir certainly sir

coming of age


jake jake jake wait a second howre you doing
im fine really
jake im sorry
acting ensign crusher report to transporter room eight
its not your fault
yeah i know i wish both of us were going
i dont know only thirty two points
mister crusher respond
im on my way doctor ive got to go
i know hey wes do well for both of us okay
all right
captains log stardate  were orbiting relva seven where wesley crusher is about to be tested for entrance into starfleet academy and to my great surprise i have just learned that my old friend admiral gregory quinn is on relva seven and has requested to be beamed aboard the enterprise immediately


welcome aboard admiral
thank you captain jean luc picard lieutenant commander dexter remmick
sir
allow me to introduce my staff first officer william riker chief medical officer beverly crusher chief of security natasha yar well what can we do for you
i need to speak with you
certainly this way number one
alone
is this a personal matter
official business
well then my first officer
alone captain

commander remmick is with the inspector generals office
oh
hell be conducting a full investigation of the enterprise
what are you looking for
i have reason to believe there may be something very wrong on this ship
tell me what you suspect
its inappropriate to discuss it at this time mister remmick starfleet is counting on you you will find out what is wrong on this ship
yes sir nothing and no one will stand in my way
and you captain are ordered to cooperate in every way necessary with this investigation is that clear
yes sir
mister remmick unless there are any further questions
no questions sir
get on with your duties
yes sir

weve known one another for years tell me what you believe is wrong
captain it is vitally important that my orders be followed exactly ill be staying on the ship
as you wish admiral

 what is it
what
the unit you just put down dont worry i wont tell anyone
its a flux coordinating sensor
im oliana mirren one of the other finalists you must be wesley crusher
yeah do you know me
i heard there was a very smart very young man whod be tough competition
well you wouldnt be here
i werent smart i know but theres a lot more to it than just that youre lucky youve had practical experience aboard the enterprise

oliana  tshanik of vulcana regar
wesley crusher of the enterprise
you do not look as if you meet the age requirements
uh ill be sixteen next month
happy birthday
excuse me  im wesley crusher
mordock
mordock the mordock the benzite who constructed the mordock strategy i thought you already were in the academy
no only a hopeful like you

finalists please take your seats im tac officer chang welcome you are here because you are all top candidates although only one student will be chosen for the academy you have shown from the preliminary testing that any of you could easily qualify this may be the most difficult exhausting experience of your life and the most exciting challenge expect the unexpected may you all do your best


may i help you mister remmick
keep on doing whatever it is youre doing commander data
theres nothing much to see here commander were in a standard orbit and the station has to be manned even if its just routine
something i can help you with mister remmick
when im ready mister riker ill want to speak with you privately
commander just having that guy around makes me feel guilty whats he after anyway
i dont know geordi but im going to find out right now

come
captain may i speak frankly
always number one
as first officer i should be informed i should know everything that you know
thats right you should
then whats this about remmick is going to turn this ship upside down
thats his job
and my job is to see that this ship runs smoothly
which you do very well
sir am i under investigation
i dont know
and if you did
i couldnt tell you
i dont understand sir this is extremely frustrating
no less so for me but i promised cooperation and thats what we shall give
sir

i want some answers from you now commander riker
later
you were ordered to cooperate
not now  when it doesnt interfere with my duties remmick

last question on the hyperspace physics test if the matter and antimatter tanks on a galaxy class starship are nine tenths depleted calculate the intermix ratio necessary to reach a starbase a hundred light years away at warp factor eight begin
 oliana runs out of time
time elapsed you now have one hour free before the next test
i must admit wesley you have a very fast mind
once as i realised it was a trick question there was only one answer
yes there is only one ratio with matter antimatter one to one
you dont know how lucky you are i cant imagine what it would be like to have things come so easily i have to push every step of the way
oh no oliana it doesnt come that easily i have to study all the time
its a good thing youre cute wesley or you could really be obnoxious see you later

did you hear what she said mordock she said i was cute
is that good wesley
yes i think

i think i should apologise captain
no need number one mister remmicks presence is unnerving to say the least
are you available now mister riker or do you still have duties to perform
im available mister remmick
any problem with using your ready room captain
no mister remmick be my guest


if you prefer to stand fine mister riker it wont have an effect on the length of my inquiry  now there are several seeming discrepancies in the captains log lets go over them one by one shall we
the captains log
yes to the best of your knowledge has the captain ever falsified a log
have you discussed this with him
right now im asking you
if you want to discuss anything about captain picard you bring him in here and ask him face to face
you are required to answer my questions mister riker unless youre trying to cover something up now there are several discrepancies in the captains log shall we go over them one by one
proceed

so you are saying captain picard had no control over this vessel he handed it over to kosinski who took the entire crew to the edge of the universe
no sir thats not what im saying now kosinski was sent by starfleet to improve our warp drive system captain picard was ordered to take him aboard
according to his own logs his bridge crew didnt think highly of mister kosinskis theories yet the captain allowed him to access to the engines anyway is that true la forge
not exactly sir
one way or the other la forge picard lost control of this ship is that true
yes but thats not how it happened
so the answer is yes

do you believe the captain is emotionally and psychologically fit for command of this starship there is nothing in his history or his personality that would suggest mental lapses
nothing
not even the ferengi incident with his old ship the stargazer
he was being controlled by a mind altering machine commander without his knowledge
i would call that a mental lapse


ensign what are you doing on the holodeck i thought you were still on relva seven
im finished testing for the day
ive disturbed you ill leave
wait i thought i wanted to be alone but i guess i dont
how is the testing
okay so far its not the ones that ive studied for that im worried about its the psych test facing my deepest fear and living through it im trying to figure out what images to bring up
why
i guess i want to scare myself what do you think bulgallian rats lightning storms
do those things frighten you
sort of i guess
the psych test is no more or less important than the rest of the process
thats what they said but i cant stop thinking about it
thinking about what you cant control only wastes your energy and creates its own enemy
how can they know what my deepest fear is when i dont
by analysing your psychological profile they were very accurate about everyone i tested with including myself
you i thought there was nothing that could frighten a klingon warrior
only fools have no fear
im sorry lieutenant im asking too many personal questions
it is very difficult for me to depend on anyone for anything but especially for my life
but on the enterprise you do that every day everyone depends on everyone else to protect them
yes
so you overcame it
no it is still my enemy

with this new extricator sir we can eliminate three more bulky machines from cargo space
thats excellent number one
captain theres an unauthorised entry in main shuttlebay
unauthorised
who is it lieutenant
computer reads the id number of jake kurland bridge to main shuttlebay mister kurland this is lieutenant yar respond
isnt the area secured
not now remmick hes going to take this out captain
im locking off the bay launch doors captain
too late hes using the flight emergency override
smart kid
kid
hes launching
on viewer lieutenant yar open channel enterprise to shuttlecraft mister kurland this is captain picard mister kurland
captain im going to beltane nine

to sign onto a freighter tell my father im sorry

you can tell him yourself in person bring that ship back at once
no

i cant face him im leaving 

captain hes unbalanced the dilithium reaction

ive lost power

all hes got left are his manoeuvring jets captain
at this trajectory hell enter the atmosphere and burn up at two hundred kilometres
probable impact
atmospheric entry seventy eight seconds
options
tractor beam
not possible hes too far away for a positive lock
hes out of transporter range
captain you are completely responsible for that boys life
mister remmick either get out of my way and keep quiet or i will have you removed from the bridge viewer on shuttle cockpit
visual on main viewer
mister kurland
i cant get the engine started what am i going to do im going to crash
he needs another fifty seconds for the core to cool down before it can restart
stay calm jake well get you back

please help me
jake
its no use captain im going to die out here

hell need another thirty seconds before he can restart
irrelevant sir even if he restarts his engine now he will not have enough thrust to escape impact
mister kurland you are not going to die out there you are going to do exactly what i tell you now take the nose of the shuttlecraft and aim it directly at relva seven

aim it at relva i cant do that its crazy

do it
but ill burn up
twenty eight seconds to impact
jake listen very carefully this is captain picard and i am giving you an order aim the shuttle at relva

okay its done
good

now monitor your speed exactly when it hits point zero two zero i want you to restart the engine

and when i tell you pull up hard jake point zero two zero speed captain i sure hope youre right
youll just have to trust me
point zero zero three

zero zero nine zero one two
six seconds to impact
hold on jake its going to be a little bumpy

zero one five

zero one nine
restart the engine now pull up hard
 yeah
incredible captain
how did he do it i thought
he built up enough speed and then bounced her off the atmosphere
mister kurland i assume you can manoeuvre it home
yes sir
do it then report to mister riker
yes sir
very original captain but how did that child acquire access to a shuttlecraft
kurland is a highly qualified enterprise academy candidate fully trained in many areas including shuttles
and did this full training include discipline
mister remmick young men sometimes make rash choices which is why mister kurland will receive a strong refresher specifically in discipline
ill note that in my report
full cooperation number one

you i have a package for operations where is it
end of the corridor room on your right one oh four

excuse me
you blocked my path you bulgallian sludge rat
im sorry it was an honest mistake i apologise
is there a problem here gentlemen
no sir i
how dare you i am rondon you despicable melanoid slimeworm liar
who do you think youre bullying you bumped into me it was your mistake you were at fault do you want this to become violent
friend i like you

a very strange reaction
not really when he raised his hand i saw that it was webbed the sign of a zaldan
but you became hostile
zaldans are infuriated by courtesy they view it as a form of phony social behaviour designed to cover true feelings
congratulations mister crusher you handled that particular incident very well
was this incident deliberate
its important to know how you candidates deal with other cultures other species
then it was a test
yes not all tests are announced or what they appear to be

zaldans have webbed fingers i wouldnt have passed

youre an android correct
yes sir
and as an android you are programmed to tell the entire truth
yes sir
there is a problem with this ship mister data its in the records somewhere i need your help to find it
all of the ships records are available to you sir
this information is very cleverly hidden your captain is not what he appears to be do not forget you have loyalty to starfleet above all else
loyalty is not the issue commander there is nothing wrong with captain picard or the ships logs therefore there must be something wrong with your original assumption
that is not acceptable mister data
acceptable or not sir it is the truth
just how did this contaminant get aboard the ship
by accident sir
meaning captain picard has no standing procedure for this type of situation
no meaning by accident sir
you dont like me very much do you
is it required sir
how would you characterise your relationship with captain picard
were starfleet officers whove known each other for many years
everything said here is confidential doctor you can be completely open with me
about what
about how you feel serving with a man who is responsible for the death of your husband
my personal feelings about captain picard are irrelevant to this investigation and none of your business
then you confirm the accuracy of the log report you violated the prime directive with the edo you deliberately interfered with their laws
yes its exactly as i explained it in the log records
all to save doctor crushers son
a member of my crew was being held unjustly i stand by my decision mister remmick you have talked to every member of this ship i think youve had enough time to find out whatever it is youre looking for
are you afraid if i keep looking that ill find youre guilty
the only thing im guilty of is allowing this charade to go on so long

admiral if it is me youre investigating ask me directly what it is you want to know and please tell me exactly what is going on
i need a little more time jeanluc
how much time i wont tolerate my crew being harassed any longer
remmicks full report is almost ready
i want to be here when he presents it
that has always been my intention commander remmick report to admiral quinn
on my way sir
this has been a strain on our friendship
i know believe me jean luc i regret that but it has been necessary


i cant get it
yes you can dont fight it relax into it and let it come by itself
no its going too fast wesley i cant do it

yes you can youve got your rotation factor just put in your vector coordinates

time elapsed

congratulations mordock that was the second fastest time ever recorded on this test you all did well
no it should not have been that way mister crusher helped me
yes i know an interesting choice mister crusher especially considering how close you and mister mordock are in overall score you all have an hour to prepare for your last test
the psych test sir
we prefer to think of it as a psychological evaluation based on reactions to various individual problems but psych test will do


sir
please sit down mister remmick proceed with your report
admiral ive done my best to be thorough during this investigation
continue
i couldnt find what you asked sir i spoke to officer after officer at length i pried into the ships log reports and yet i could find nothing wrong except perhaps a casual familiarity among the bridge crew but mostly that comes from a sense of teamwork and the feeling of family im sorry sir i did my best
quite youre dismissed commander
yes sir captain picard my tour in the inspector generals office will be up in six months when im finished this is where id like to serve sir

dont judge the young man too harshly hes a good officer
its not him im inclined to judge
dont judge me too harshly either until ive finished we had to be very sure of you some of us at starfleet command became suspicious of certain problems in the federation
what kind of problems
something or someone is trying to destroy the fabric of everything weve built up in the last two hundred years
whats your evidence
i cant go into that there are too many people involved
what do you want from me
i dont know whether the threat comes from the inside or whether its from outside i need people i can trust in strong positions throughout the federation
you have my complete support you know that
thats not enough i want to promote you to admiral and i want you to take over as commandant of starfleet academy
the academy
yes
the academy
i need you close
then there was never a problem with the enterprise
no but i had to be sure you hadnt been coopted
greg this is politics and im not good at politics surely there are others who are better suited
all right even if i am wrong and i hope i am youre still the best man for the job
i appreciate the value of what youre offering its not a decision i can make quickly
i need an answer soon
all right youll have it tonight admiral thank you


mister mordock will be finished with his psych test momentarily

mordock are you all right
i will be
mister crusher youre next good luck


im here im ready  maybe they forgot breathe got to remember to breathe



evacuate immediately sixty five seconds to seal off
somebody help theres somethings wrong in the environmental lab
help



help were trapped i cant move please help me

were going to die in here

the liquid hydrogens going to blow the shut off valve ruptured hurry up my legs are crushed youve got to help me

give me a hand with this
were going to die
help me
i cant its too late
thirty seconds to seal off

come on
if we dont get out of here fast theyll seal us in to contain the explosion
 come on youre not hurt
i cant go through that
yes you can youve got to
twenty seconds to seal off
come on i cant carry you both youre not hurt
ten seconds to seal off
come on
its too late

im sorry

officer chang theres
wesley its all right

thanks
an excellent performance mister crusher

performance that was the test
yes
a man could have died
theoretically yes you had to make a choice and you did theres no right or wrong about it your greatest fear has been that you couldnt make that decision
because of my father because cap because someone made that choice and my father died

sir
yes number one
mister remmick has left the ship
yes he found nothing wrong on the enterprise and you can inform the crew that admiral quinn is most impressed
thank you theyll be pleased that can you explain now what he was after
they were after me number one they want me to take over as commandant starfleet academy
congratulations what a wonderful choice sir youll be able to shape the minds of the future leaders of starfleet you havent decided what youre going to do
yes i have number one ive decided im going for a walk

im proud of all of you youve done a superb job each of you would make a fine starfleet officer its unfair that only one candidate from relva will attend the academy this year and a loss to the federation if the rest of you do not return to test again mister mordock will be the candidate his results were slightly higher than mister crushers congratulations mister mordock youre the first benzite in starfleet
thank you sir but its not right it shouldnt be me wesley lost points because he helped me he should not be punished for his generosity
he wasnt he lost time but it wasnt only that candidates thank you and good luck

i am sorry wesley
its okay you deserved to win besides you would have done the same thing for me
yes i believe i would
congratulations
well personally i hate losing so youd better be ready next year wesley i wont be easy to beat


mister kurland
yes sir
are you feeling better
yes sir look im sorry i damaged the shuttle captain but mister riker says i can work on fixing it as part of my discipline training
good idea i hope you learned that running away solves nothing
yes sir and i am sorry i messed up
at least you kept your wits about you out there dont forget that
no sir and thank you thank you for saving my life
thats my job young man
yes sir

mister crusher why arent you in your dress uniform for admiral quinns farewell dinner
i didnt think that would be appropriate
why not
i failed captain i didnt get into the academy i failed you and i failed the enterprise
ridiculous did you do your best
yes
when you test next year and you will test next year do you think your performance will improve
yes
good the only person youre truly competing against wesley is yourself
then youre not disappointed
wesley you have to measure your successes and your failures within not by anything i or anyone else might think but if it helps you to know this i failed the first time and you may not tell anyone
you you failed
yes but not the second time now youll do me the courtesy of joining us at dinner i have to disappoint an old friend

wish i could convince you to change your mind
ill serve you better here
this is where you belong
if you need me
ive been playing politics too long perhaps i see conspiracies everywhere dont worry safe travels my friend

set course to algeron four mister crusher
course plotted and laid in sir
then shall we continue with our mission
yes sir
excellent mister crusher engage
heart of glory


captain communication from starfleet they have reported a disturbance in the neutral zone
of what nature
a battle quadrant nine coordinates zero seven zero mark three theres no information who is involved they are asking if we can investigate
answer affirmative lieutenant la forge lay in the course
aye sir
i have no reports of any federation ships in that area sir
ferengi
its a little out of their territory
shall we separate the saucer
lets get a little more information first
course set captain
speed warp seven
aye sir warp seven
engage

we are now approaching the neutral zone
sir sensors indicate several recent photon explosions and heavy phaser activity
sir i have analysed the residue from the explosions this is of no known ferengi design it is possibly romulan
now theres a name we havent heard for a while
i could go a lot longer without hearing it
if the romulans have returned to this sector we should know about that mister worf any further activity
negative sir
slow to half impulse
going to one half impulse now entering quadrant nine zero seven mark three
shields and deflectors up go to yellow alert
i have located a vessel sir it is drifting
put it on main viewer
aye sir
magnify

the life support systems on the ship are failing sir propulsion navigation and all communication inoperative
any trace of the other vessel
no sir
if it is a romulan vessel it could be cloaked
tell starfleet were entering the neutral zone
yes sir
mister la forge take us in a little closer
aye aye sir
stay sharp everyone
its talarian
life signs
nothing yet sir
i have identified the vessel captain it is the batris a general cargo vessel
a long way from home
keep alert
captain possible life signs
what do you mean possible
the readings emanate from a location near what is left of main engineering there is a great deal of magnetic and radioactive clutter making a positive determination difficult
ill prepare an away team
lieutenant yar you stay at your post if this is the result of a romulan attack they may still be in the area
aye sir
data geordi lets go
mister la forge are we close enough to use the visual acuity transmitter
we can certainly try it sir
please do and number one everything about this seems wrong
agreed it smells like a trap lets go
captains log stardate  we have entered the neutral zone where a talarian freighter has been severely damaged in a battle i have sent an away team to investigate


what exactly does this device do
data and i have been working on a way to transmit what my visor sees if it works the bridgell be able to monitor us
it has restrictions the information from geordis visor is so complex it is difficult to encode therefore the signal breaks down easily
that means it doesnt have much range
exactly so far the effective range is only few kilometres but were working on it la forge to bridge
this is the bridge
worf ive switched on the visual acuity transmitter
we are receiving the signal is strong
okay worf i am switching off for transport
set phasers on stun lets be ready for anything energise


la forge to bridge
this is the enterprise
captain im switching on the transmitter

ready to receive put this on main viewer
aye sir

extraordinary now im beginning to understand him
geordi what was that over to the left
what
yes that no no back yes that right there what is that

thats commander riker

ah to me its just an undefined form standing in a visual frenzy can you filter out the extraneous information
no i get it all simultaneously
but its just a jumble

how can you make head or tail of it
i select what i want and then disregard the rest
but how is that possible
well how in a noisy room can you select one specific voice or sound
of course something you learn
exactly

its something i have learned does that make it more clear
look over at data theres an aura around data
well of course hes an android
you say that as if you think thats what we all see
dont you

sir i hate to break this up but

oh yes of course number one proceed

lets go

i am detecting high levels of deuterium gas probably from the leakage in the drive system
toxic
not as yet sir the life signs are emanating from the far side of engineering
whats the safest way around
all routes are equally dangerous sir
well whats the least dangerous route data
there is no significant difference
steady on
commander riker commander
yes geordi
theres a fissure developing in the bulkhead the skin of the ship is losing its integrity
rik
the arsenal of freedom

captains log stardate  we have been ordered by starfleet to proceed to the lorenze cluster and investigate the disappearance of a light cruiser uss drake which was in that system trying to unravel a mystery of its own which began when recent long range probes indicated that all intelligent life on the planet minos has disappeared

number one
no help from their communications log the drake reported arriving at minos and then wasnt heard from again
mister data
the citizens of minos gained fame during the ersalrope wars as arms merchants they manufactured sophisticated and highly advanced weaponry
yeah for which side
both
we are approaching the planet minos sir
standard orbit mister la forge
aye sir standard orbit
whatever happened to the drake happened quickly otherwise a man like rice would have reported again
you know captain rice
we were at the academy together
tell me about him
able a good officer
how would he react under stress
paul rice is confident to the point of arrogance he but carries it well because hes usually right hes a risk taker
really
ill give you an example one of the final tests in advance navigation at the academy provides the student with three options rice was given this test rejected their options and offered one of his own
thats taking a risk
and it paid off he received the top grade and now that same test has four options
in a difficult situation a man like that would act aggressively
agreed
commander werent you offered the drake
yes
you gave up your own command to take this assignment
at the time i thought it would be more advantageous for me to do a tour on the enterprise
captain readings correspond with the findings of the probe no signs of intelligent life forms vegetation and animal life only
what happened to all the people
war
disease
a dissatisfied customer
in any war natural disaster even the most virulent plague there are always survivors
captain we are being hailed
how can that be from a planet with no people
your sensors indicated no intelligent life forms
correct sir something has scanned our language banks and is hailing us
on main viewer
whoever you are wherever youre from greetings welcome to minos the arsenal of freedom
i am captain jeanluc picard of the uss
if you need a little something special be it for one target or multiple targets we got it youll see it here on minos where we live by the motto peace through superior firepower
to whom am i speaking
to be totally armed is to be totally secure remember the early bird that hesitates gets wormed
it is a recorded message sir
minos the arsenal of freedom perfection in highly advanced weaponry versatility
we must have triggered something left over from the erselrope wars when the arms business was booming
so lock on to my signal and beam on down because we dont just provide weapons
shut that off
we provide complete weapons systems
its a heck of a sales pitch
if an automated message system is still functioning there could be other systems on that planet that are still operational
weapons systems
possibly
were going to have to go down there to find it
number one prepare am away team
lieutenant yar data
commander i recommend a minimum complement
oh i would have thought otherwise
well keep the first landing party small and mobile until im confident that whatever killed the inhabitants of this planet isnt still down there
okay


spooky riker

this is the bridge
well start a pattern search from this point
keep this channel open

aye sir
commander our communications are being monitored
by whom
since there is no intelligent life the question is by what

captain
yes we heard that number one well try and track it down from here

tritanium its been melted
what could do that
i dont know whatever it was its beyond our technology
over here
wow

weve never even seen anything like this
its undamaged
maybe a demonstration model for some potential buyer
maybe lets spread out a little

commander riker this is ensign tsu

im monitoring a slight energy buildup near your position i am not able to pinpoint the source
give me a direction

east of your position ten metres i will continue monitoring

i cant see anything through here the underbrush is too thick
hello commander riker
rice where did you come from
i was over there
we were worried about you i should have known youd pop up
how are you commander riker
me forget about me how are you no word no message nothing
how many are with you
there are two others wheres the drake wheres your crew
number one a word we have some information you should be aware of

ensign tsu tsu sensors indicate low level energy readings but the only life signs are the away team
you copy number one

understood you look strange paul
i was injured getting here

do you need medical help
no whats your purpose here
commander data lieutenant yar
sir other than ourselves i am picking up no life signs here
i know
riker you didnt answer me who sent you here to look for me
your mother shes worried about you
tell me about your ship riker its the enterprise isnt it
no the name of my ship is the lollipop
i have no knowledge of that ship
its just been commissioned its a good ship
refresh me would you riker whats its size its complement
who is here with you
whats the armament on the lollipop
paul i will only answer your questions if you answer mine why do you want to know so much about my ship
were friends arent we
old friends
our top speed is warp three whats yours
is then the drake has not been destroyed
the drake
yes your ship
of course my ship is the drake
where is it
classified
classified
please its important our survival depends on knowing whats the armament on your ship
ten
ten i dont understand ten what
six
commander riker your answers make no sense
you havent used my first name once paul you remember it dont you you dont do you because you dont exist youre a fake youre an image of the original arent you answer me

report number one
the image of rice has been replaced by something which is hovering several metres away

number one get your team back up here

prepare to beam up

commander


whats happened number one report report report

he cant answer you captain
commander riker just has been encased in some kind of energy field

is he alive

unknown
captains log supplemental some kind of weapon which for a time took the form of captain paul rice has enveloped commander riker

transporter room three have you been able to lock on to the away team
i am unable to lock on to commander riker sir
ensign tsu situation report
previous energy readings are gone
data have you been able to assess commander rikers condition
he appears to be in some kind of stasis
theorise mister data what would be the purpose of such an encasement

typically the purpose of such an enclosure is for storage
which would suggest what
that sooner or later someone or something will be along to collect him

stand by im coming down
you sir
yes doctor crusher this is the captain meet me in transporter room three mister la forge you have command of the bridge
aye sir
and whatever happens down there your prime responsibility is to the ship
understood sir
captain i take great exception to your decision to beam down
noted

is it just riker
yes apparently hes confined in some sort of force field energise

any changes
datas figured out what it is
are you getting any life signs
he is alive what appeared in the form of captain rice is
skin of evil

captains log stardate  we are crossing through the zed lapis sector where we will rendezvous with shuttlecraft thirteen carrying deanna troi who is returning from a conference because engineering is involved in preventive maintenance on our dilithium crystals we are presently travelling on impulse power

routine deep sensor probe indicates no obstacles or vessels within a range of three light years
confirm
the martial arts competition is in three days are you prepared
i will be if youll meet me on the holodeck later i need your help on the mishiama wristlock and break if it works on you i can use it on anyone
a valid assumption who is your first competitor
science officer swenson
you will defeat him easily
im more concerned with lieutenant minnerlys kick boxing
you are favoured in the ships pool
you bet on me
a sure thing
captain estimated rendezvous with the shuttle in one hour and ten minutes
thank you lieutenant
aye sir
itll be good to have counsellor troi back wont it number one
it certainly will
sir im receiving an emergency transmission from the shuttle
on main viewer
i cant sir were receiving audio only
open the frequency
aye sir
what a jolt
position report
sir i have an onboard systems failure youll have to tell me where i am
i read your coordinates at three seven zero point two three six confirm
i cant confirm my instruments are haywire
lieutenant prieto is counsellor troi all right
yes sir just a little shaken were being buffeted a bit losing more power my flight control computers fried
main engineering
lieutenant commander leland t lynch here sir
how long before we can return to warp power

captain im in the middle of realigning the dilithium crystals
there is an emergency we need warp drive how long
twenty minutes maybe more

we dont have it mister lynch
ill align it by hand
whatever it takes
aye sir
shuttle this is the enterprise your coordinates now read two three seven point one zero one ben youre dangerously close to a planet
i can see it
the planet is vagra two sir in the zed lapis sector uninhabited
lieutenant report
this is counsellor troi ill relay sir the pilot is busy weve lost most of our impulse power
engineering status report

working on it captain three minutes

but there are no guarantees
captain were out of control were caught in the planets gravity
captains log supplemental weve lost all contact with shuttlecraft thirteen and can only assume theyve crashlanded on vagra two meanwhile main engineering is trying to return us to warp power

forget the final check initiate startup sequence
beginning check list
override we are going directly to startup
that procedure is not recommended
understood now prime matterantimatter injectors set ratio at twentyfive to one
ratio set
power engine core inject reactants

leland t lynch here captain we now have minimum warp drive
course plotted and set for vagra two
warp eight
i said minimum warp drive captain
you heard the order mister lynch make it so
yes sir

approaching vagra two captain
strange sir theres no emergency signal from the shuttle as yet
what is this place mister data
there is little information in the library computer other than the fact of its existence our sensor show no signs of life forms virtually no vegetation
atmosphere
minimum for our needs sir
standard orbit
aye sir standard orbit
ive located the shuttle
life signs
not yet sir still probing it appears to be buried under a lot of debris i may have something sir faint life signs very faint
how many
theres no way of telling from here
data can we beam up the injured
no sir our sensors are not fully penetrating whatever the debris is
thats very unusual
yes sir i cannot explain
number one prepare your away team
right away data yar
doctor crusher have you been monitoring all this
yes ill meet the away team in transporter room four


lets go the life signs are weak

what is this
no idea well go around just to be on the safe side

lets try the other way

enterprise this is riker weve got a problem

what kind of problem number one
im not sure yet there appears to be some kind of a slick blocking our path will keep you apprised
maintain an open frequency
aye sir

analysis mister data
inconclusive sir i cannot tell you what it is but i can tell you what it is not
explain
there is no evidence of neural or circulatory systems no internal organs cellular structure unknown it does not have any proteins which are known to us
its narrower over here we can get over it
how is it moving data
i do not know sir it does not appear to have a skeletal framework or musculature
then whats causing it to move
it appears to be following us sir
no sign of intelligence no brain as we know it yet evidence of thought mister data
insufficient information sir

is it a life form data
again insufficient information sir
theorise

it is possible

very good tin man

what is it number one what are you seeing


trouble
captains log supplemental while on a mission to rescue survivors from an unexplained shuttle crash the away team has encountered a strange creature which seems able to assume different forms including one which resembles humanoid

easy number one lets find out what it is were dealing with
agreed captain
number one i dont believe that the location of the crash and the proximity of the creature is a coincidence

i am commander william riker of the uss enterprise
i am armus why are you here
we mean you no harm we have injured crewmen in the shuttlecraft we need to get to them may we pass
you havent given me a good enough reason
preserving life all life is very important to us
why
we believe everything in the universe has a right to exist
an interesting notion which i do not share you may now leave if you wish
were not going without our shuttle crew
i warn you
enough we have people who need attention we wont hurt you but we must help them

number one
the creature attacked us lieutenant yar is down
it seems to feed on our phaser energy
we had no effect on it

whats lieutenant yars condition doctor crusher report
shes dead

transporter room get them up now
transporter room
i need her in sickbay now

go to yellow alert lieutenant worf ill be in sickbay
aye sir

status doctor
unchanged
can you bring her back
well see neural stimulator
neural stimulator locked in
interlock current feeds set sensitivity factor to four point four
affirmative
monitoring two point three one point eight
you did it
no ive got her on full support there is no independent brain function
current feeds operating
shes not responding doctor her synaptic network is breaking down
inject norep
neurons are beginning to depolarise
lets go for direct reticular stimulation
direct
do it  increase to seventy microvolts

eighty five microvolts  again  ninety again again shes gone
gone
there was too much synaptic damage that thing just sucked the life right out of her theres nothing i can do


your friends have deserted you theyre not coming back
youre wrong
i killed one of them
yes i know
how could you be in there and know that
i felt her die
do you want to know why i killed her
your answer would be meaningless that act had no reason
exactly it had no meaning i did it because i wanted to it amused me
no you thought it would amuse you but it didnt you felt no satisfaction
no it was too easy
you wanted her to suffer you have a great need
i need nothing
liar end this let us go
not yet
they wont give you what you want
and what is that
to break their spirit
oh is that what i want if breaking their spirit will amuse me then thats what i will have
never

she didnt do anything her phaser was lowered
she only wanted to get to troi and lieutenant prieto
there was nothing provocative about what she did
she was killed in a brutal senseless act
lieutenant yars death is very painful for all of us we will have to deal with it as best we can for now until the shuttle crew is safely beamed aboard this ship our feelings will have to wait is that understood lieutenant worf you are now acting chief of security
i will do my best sir
doctor what is the state of the shuttle crew
were still receiving faint life signs but the sensor readings are fluctuating they may not be accurate
armus is capable of creating undefined forcefields in effect we are powerless to communicate or use the transporter unless it allows it
a creature against whom we seem to have no defence number one
its down on that planet waiting for us to come back it killed tasha and it could have killed us but it didnt deanna and ben are alive for a reason and it knows were not going anywhere as long as theyre still alive
are you saying its attack on yar was not arbitrary but part of some tactic
the only way to find out is to go back down
commander i may be able to see something in the creature which might be helpful
agreed prepare your away team number one
lieutenant worf
i will remain on the ship the object here is not to engage the creature in battle the goal is the safe return of counsellor troi and lieutenant prieto i can best accomplish this at the tactical station
very good number one

enterprise
number one
were approaching the shuttlecraft the creature is covering it

i lied to you they came back
let me talk with them
no
why does the thought of my having contact with them make you uneasy
no not being able to contact you not knowing if you are alive makes them uneasy cant you feel how worried they are
yes yes they are worried
they care for you you must be very special
we are members of a community we all care for one another
equally
you were really surprised they came back
yes
why because the others did not
what others
you cant hide the emptiness from me the others the ones who hurt you who left you alone rejected the ones who make you so angry
what do you know of them
only what you tell me
i will tell you nothing
not now but soon

captain look at this the force of the energy field around the shuttlecraft decreased for a few moments when the creature was draped over it
but not low enough to beam them out
almost
its approaching the away team now and the energy field over the shuttlecraft is back to full intensity
chart it i want to see if theres a pattern
aye sir


she said youd be back
then she is alive
for now why have you returned
we have no choice were here to negotiate for our team what do you want
maybe i want nothing
then you would have killed all of us
i still might
what do you want tell me maybe we can reach an accommodation
if i tell you will you give it to me
i might it depends
i am a doctor i need to treat our injured friends
say please
please
you ask nicely i will allow it wait ive changed my mind talk to her from here
how troi can you hear me

deanna are you all right
beverly

i can hear you
are you all right

yes

weve encountered some difficulty

i know

she needs our help
so what
our friends are suffering only a few metres away yet you block our path why
you are all ungrateful
what is he made of
it did not register on the tricorder
it does that mean i am not alive
no clearly you are some kind of intelligent form
but you said i did not register on your instrument perhaps your instruments are useless

dont help him
data
half metre to the right geordi

arent you going to lead him to his sight again robot
no you will just move it again and i will not help you hurt him
then give it to him i will find something else to amuse me


you said they wouldnt amuse me you were right
and the emptiness remains you sound so alone
i am alone
abandoned who deserted you
creatures whose beauty now dazzles all who see them they would not exist without me
you were together
they perfected a means of bringing to the surface all that was evil and negative within erupting spreading connecting in time it formed second skin dank and vile
you
yes
they discarded you and left
and here i am
you have my pity

your pity save that for yourself


help data somethings got me
touch him and he dies
no no dont

enterprise

armus has enveloped commander riker
im beaming you up

if any of you leave now he dies

and so do the survivors of the crash

captains log supplemental there is grave danger to the crew on vagra two my first officer is missing attacked by this entity known as armus

captain perhaps you should look at this we have the chart of the energy field surrounding the shuttle
there are a great deal of fluctuations
yes but there is a pattern here is when it killed lieutenant yar and here is when it absorbed commander riker
and here here where the energy is lowest
both times it had enveloped the shuttle
it has something to do with counsellor troi somehow when its dealing with her the energy field is affected i want to talk to her im going to beam down lieutenant worf you have the conn


imzadi no please stop hurting him
he resists if he would give himself over the pain would diminish he struggles you should feel his strength
i can
should i let him go
you only ask to torment me
perhaps
how should i answer what can i offer except myself
and would you give yourself for him would you give that much
yes without hesitation
just for him
no not just for him i would do the same for any of the others armus you have me let them go
perhaps ah another has arrived


you are the one in charge
 is commander riker alive
answer tin man
i would guess that death is no longer sufficient entertainment to alleviate its boredom therefore commander riker is alive
maybe dont you want to ask me what i want
no
not even to protect your own existence
i want to see my people in the shuttle
entertain me  then i will do it myself you tin man

now tell me how would you feel if you were the instrument of death for your leader
dont struggle data
i have no control over what you do with the phaser therefore i would not be the instrument of his death
perhaps killing the doctor would engender more feeling
no the control is still yours
and what about you doctor are you ready to die tell me you are not afraid
i am afraid
beg me to spare you
no
one of you is going to die and you doctor get to choose you dont like that do you
then i choose myself
no you are going to live one of them dies

maybe this one though i would not call it death since he is only a device tell me tin man how does it feel to face your own extinction
curious  you are capable of great sadism and cruelty interesting no redeeming qualities
so what do you think
i think you should be destroyed
a moral judgment from a machine
data armus were finished dealing with you
i have your man in here and the others in the shuttle
it doesnt matter we will no longer be a source of amusement
i can kill them
yes you can but only i can command them they follow my orders
have them amuse me
only if you let me see my people on the shuttle first i must see them
not possible
then our business with you is concluded
and you claim you care about your comrades
i care which is why i must see them
you want to see your people then here look at this one

hes alive dont move
is he all right
all signs show normal
so much frustration it had to get rid of me
now let me see the others
no
i will not allow my people to entertain you until you do
they are incapable of entertaining me
i want the four of you out of here enterprise beam up the away team immediately
aye sir
theyre no longer involved this is between you and me
they may leave

now
i want to leave this place
you want me to give you transportation
for which i will trade you lives
i must see my people in the shuttle
will you give me what i want
i have the means but first i must see my people
if you must


troi are you all right
yes but ben is not
hes alive
were you able to help tasha
no troi troi we must talk i believe its possible to outmanoeuvre this creature and beam you and ben back up to the ship weve been monitoring the energy field that surrounds the shuttle when the creature is here the field weakens do you know why
the creature is filled with rage undirected unfocused rage when he confronts it his guard goes down because hes feeling it instead of suppressing it acknowledging his needs makes him vulnerable
what caused the rage
he was left here abandoned

the forcefield will have to drop below two point seven before we can beam them up


satisfied
yes
then can we leave
where do you want to go do you want to try to find those who left you here
she told you about them
how long have you been here
since they left a very long time
a long time to be alone
save your compassion its revolting you offer it like a prize when in fact its an insult
because you feel unworthy
you overrate your gift you humans are puny weak
but our spirit it is indomitable
and still you die from a flake of my power
a great poet once said all spirits are enslaved that serve things evil
you do not understand i do not serve things evil i am evil
oh no you are not
i am a skin of evil left here by a race of titans who believed if they rid themselves of me they would free the bonds of destructiveness
yes so here you are feeding on your own loneliness consumed by your own pain believing your own lies

set the computer when the energy level reaches two point six point two zero five automatically beam up troi and prieto well do a parallel transport on the captain
yes sir

you say you are true evil shall i tell you what true evil is it is to submit to you it is when we surrender our freedom our dignity instead of defying you
i will kill you and those in there
but you will still be here in this place for ever alone immortal

 stand by for parallel transport
the energy level has dropped to two point six point three

thats your real fear never to die never again to be united with those who left you here

energy field is two point six computer beginning transport

im not taking you anywhere

captains log stardate  the shuttlecraft has been destroyed to prevent any possibility of armus leaving the planet vagra two will be declared off limits but the damage has been done one of the saddest duties ive ever had to perform is now ahead of me

we are here together to honour our friend and comrade lieutenant natasha yar coming to terms with the loss of a colleague is perhaps the most difficult tasks we must face in the work we have chosen to pursue we will all find time to grieve for her in the days that are ahead but for now she has asked that we celebrate her life with this

hello my friends you are here now watching this image of me because i have died it probably happened while i was on duty and quickly which is what i expected never forget i died doing exactly what i chose to do what i want you to know is how much i loved my life and those of you who shared it with me you are my family you all know where i came from and what my life was like before but starfleet took that frightened angry young girl and tempered her i have been blessed with your friendship and your love will riker you are the best you trusted me you encouraged me and most of all you made me laugh deanna you are capable of so much love you taught me without ever having to say a word i realised i could be feminine without losing anything ah worf we are so much alike you and i both warriors orphans who found ourselves this family i hope i met death with my eyes wide open beverly your fierce devotion comes from within it cant be diminished from you i have learned to strive for excellence no matter what the personal cost wesley im sorry i wont be able to see you grow into the exceptional man youll be but your kindness and innocence are ageless geordi in those moments i felt the most despair you took my hand and helped me to see things differently you taught me to look beyond the moment my friend data you see things with the wonder of a child and that makes you more human than any of us captain jeanluc picard i wish i could say youve been like a father to me but ive never had one so i dont know what it feels like but if there was someone in this universe i could choose to be like someone who i would want to make proud of me its you you who have the heart of an explorer and the soul of a poet so youll understand when i say death is that state in which one exists only in the memory of others which is why it is not an end no goodbyes just good memories hailing frequencies closed sir
au revoir natasha the gathering is concluded

sir the purpose of this gathering confuses me
oh how so
my thoughts are not for tasha but for myself i keep thinking how empty it will feel without her presence did i miss the point
no you didnt data you got it
symbiosis


all hands this is the captain as you may know the sun in the delos system is undergoing largescale magnetic field changes producing violent gigantic flares now we shall be studying this star at close range even though we shall be running with full deflectors the closeness of this event and its severity are going to create problems

intense magnetic fields have a disruptive effect on electrical systems therefore we can expect communications interruptions as well as potential temporary loss of other systems as a precaution we are now going to yellow alert stay sharp everyone

attention all decks yellow alert
engineering this is lieutenant commander data bring all systems online and direct full power to the shields

all sections secure sir
lieutenant la forge
course is set captain
half impulse
aye sir one half impulse
on main viewer mask out the photosphere magnify quadrant one seven magnification factor twelve
ive never seen anything like this before the violence of these eruptions is awesome
captain im reading an unusual number of sunspots and eruptive prominences sir the magnetic field is extremely irregular
captain deflectors are being hit by a huge burst of xrays

wow look captain my console seems to be overloading
the xray burst is disrupting systems captain im adjusting deflectors to compensate

engineering increase power to forward shields
forward deflectors online sir


status report
all systems operational sir
captain the level of tension on the ship is mounting
understandable mister data
if we are to investigate sir we must get closer
mister la forge move us in closer this is the captain we will be pushing the shields to the limit but we are getting a splendid view of this phenomenon
captain i have intercepted what appears to be a distress signal
let me hear it
this is tjon i am on the ornaran freighter  we have a serious problem here cant seem to fix it we need help
the transmission is coming from a freighter in orbit around the fourth planet in the system however the receiving station is on the third planet
open hailing frequencies
hailing frequencies open
unidentified freighter this is the uss enterprise may we be of assistance
 whoever you are yes im having trouble navigating we cant maintain a steady course please help us if you can
cant you enhance the frequency
too much interference
set course to intersect with the freighter warp two
aye sir
maintain yellow alert
i cant control the helm any longer im losing orbit were heading into the atmosphere please do something were going to burn up we havent much time
it is a freighter very old
captain our sensors are being severely affected by the sun flares
helm take us in as close as possible to the freighters orbit
moving in sir
there are six life forms aboard the freighter sir
captain the freighters orbit is decaying
how long before it loses integrity
a matter of minutes
unidentified freighter this is the uss enterprise
enterprise this is the ornaran freighter sanction
put this on the main viewer
the visual transmission is still breaking up
freighter sanction this is the enterprise what is your situation
not so good helm isnt working right what is the problem
this is the enterprise with all this interference it is difficult to copy your transmission if you all talk at once it is almost impossible now please say again what is your situation
i am tjon captain of the sanction
at last how can we help
we have lost i dont know something i am no longer able to maintain this orbit nor am i able to use the main thrusters its all you know dead i guess its all shut down
well that is a little vague what is the computer analysis
well the computers not working very well
data can you tap into their computer and clarify the situation
i will attempt it sir
captain the tractor beam is available if you want it
at least we can pull them out of orbit before they enter the atmosphere
freighter were going to lock on the tractor beam and pull you out of orbit
hey thats thats great
captain the freighters orbit continues to deteriorate
the solar flares are interfering with the tractor beam captain i cant lock on
captain tjon we are unable to attach our tractor beam because of the intense solar activity
i understand thanks for trying
sir i have determined what is malfunctioning on the freighter
captain we have analysed your problem
great
data
your ships design uses an electromagnetic coil to constrict the exhaust flow that coil is misaligned
really
do you have the necessary tools to realign the coil
i dont think so
i believe captain we can provide them with a temporary substitute our ships stores contain a coil of the proper type
can we beam one over
yes
captain were beaming over a replacement coil
thats great and thatll fix us up
yes once its installed
right and how do we do that
what is the matter with these people how can he be captain of that vessel and not understand its simplest function
captain how long have you been in command of this freighter
seven years this is my twentysixth voyage to brekka
and you dont know how to align a control coil
its never come up
can anyone else over there do it
hold on ill ask sorry nobody here knows anything about it
id better get over with a team
captain i strongly recommend against anyone from this ship beaming over the solar interference is too great
the freighter has entered the planets atmosphere disintegration is imminent
were running out of options
lets get them off there tjon stand by to beam over
if you think thats best
unless you have any other options yes i think thats best
whatever you say


i cant maintain a positive lock

unusual em burst sir readings off scale

freighter sanction this is the enterprise were having difficulty getting a fix
have them go to their own transporter room it will be tricky but perhaps i can link the two transporters in series and get them over with the increased power
its worth a try captain tjon go to your transporter room contact me from there
right enterprise its right next door but if you cant get us with your transporter what makes you think ours will do the job
im going to interconnect them
i didnt know you could do that
hurry were running out of time
were on our way
i dont think theyre going to make it
captain tjon doesnt sound like he cares one way or the other
worf how much time do we have
one minute twenty eight seconds
captain tjon are you there
were in the transporter room
great activate your transporter set coordinates nine seven zero three mark two six eight
did you say two eight six or eight eight six
mark two six eight
got it

sir the hull temperature of the freighter is passing three thousand degrees
whats the hold up number one

were establishing the link right now
were ready
then all six of you get on the transporter platform on my signal energise ive got their initial transporter signal interlock complete energise on my mark four three two one energise

number one did you get them off
no sir they stayed in the freighter

but they beamed over their cargo
cargo are those people crazy what could possibly be so important
sir the freighter is disintegrating
their lives are in danger and theyre beaming over cargo number one i dont understand these people
captain the freighters hull temperature is approaching critical

unbelievable
were losing the freighter got to beam those people over now
clear the cargo beam it to a hold
aye sir
freighter sanction this is the enterprise get to your transporter pad and no forget about that lock on to any life form you can find and get them over now
trying sir

the freighter is going down
transporter room youre out of time

reading six life forms but i cant get a solid lock
we have no choice energise i thought you said there were six where are the other two
the lock didnt hold
reestablish
its too late


number one


two are lost sir but we saved four im commander william riker of the uss enterprise im sorry we were unable to rescue the other two we did everything we could if you had come instead of sending your cargo you all would have made it
the cargo where is it
you did save it didnt you

yes we did its in one of our cargo holds you act like its more important than your comrades
the cargo may we see it
follow me

thank you thank you we thought we had lost it
 careful with your choice of words tjon its ours not yours
we paid a fair price for it
 you offered a fair price we have not received it
you accepted our goods in trade
then where are they tell me
thats not our problem
no more than the barrel is your property its as simple as this the goods were never delivered they were destroyed with your ship
hence the deal was incomplete hence possession of the felicium remains ours
we need it
commander i request you transport my associate and myself down to brekka with our merchandise
yes get them out of here but the barrel stays
theres no reasoning with you
langor you expect too much from them you always have and youve always been disappointed you didnt pay for it therefore its not yours
damn you sobi

stop this now
security to cargo bay eleven

behave yourselves gentlemen

escort our visitors to the observation lounge

a natural electrical charge
formidable
yes and a difficult weapon to confiscate

i have never seen humanoids with that power
neither have i i wonder how it evolved
i wonder if the strong magnetic field of their sun might have something to do with it
could be i wonder how much power our guests can produce
or if they need to recharge
thats an interesting ability the question is how do i defend against it
you think our visitors pose a threat
i dont know but if they do id better be ready for it
precisely lieutenant

we have to resolve this soon there isnt much time
what can you offer
everything we had went down with the sanction
then its going to be difficult to accommodate you

solar flares are increasing in magnitude captain shields are shaky but theyre holding
maintain

how are our rather quarrelsome guests
theyre waiting for you in the observation lounge sir
data what information can you give us about the inhabitants of this system
not very much sir the only recorded contact with the delos system was over two hundred years ago a scout ship reported two inhabited planets one of which was on the verge of acquiring space travel
odd that in two centuries neither civilisation advanced much further
sir i find it strange that none of our visitors feels much remorse about the two freighter passengers who perished yet that barrel of cargo is a source of great anxiety to them
yes lets pay a call get some answers number one mister data mister la forge you have the bridge
aye sir

captain may i present sobi and langor from the planet brekka and tjon and romas from ornara
i am sorry we couldnt save your ship
tell me you could have repaired it
oh yes
we have only two left neither works properly they are critical to our survival will you fix them
mister data
our computer has downloaded the specifications for the magnetic coils the freighters depend on assuming the malfunction is similar suitable replacements can be fabricated
instruct engineering to proceed
aye sir
now as for our cargo
our cargo captain
wrong sobi
my first officer has said that ownership of this cargo is in dispute but this question must be settled by whatever legal mechanism exists between your societies
captain you dont understand this is a matter of life and death
why is that what is this cargo
medicine
indeed
our planet is in desperate need captain we have people suffering from a lethal plague
the cargo you have impounded is the only hope of life for our people
is that so
yes
you must think us heartless brutes captain but look at our side of it the plant which yields the medicine felicium grows only in remote areas of brekka
it must be painstakingly cultivated harvested purified a complex and expensive process
that single shipment of felicium represents an enormous investment we cant just give it away
we paid for it we are asking only for what is ours
that is your viewpoint ours of course differs
you are going to hold to that position
i am constrained to abide by the terms of our agreement
then you condemn us to death
romas
you disgust me if you could see the suffering the plague has caused well you are going to when you see what it does to us
romas are you and tjon carrying this plague
yes every ornaran does
then you may have brought it aboard this ship was there a medical scan when they transported
unverified the solar flares could have caused a malfunction in the biofilter
med alert medical emergency doctor crusher to the observation lounge at once


you find us well i trust
as far as i can tell your physiology is somewhat different than ive ever encountered but i detect no dangerous virus or bacteria
i assure you were in perfect health
but we are not we need our medicine
our medicine
we paid for it its ours now
enough
of course you are right doctor could we leave now
i see no reason why not escort them to their quarters

doctor
captain could i speak with you please in private
not right now captain

what have you learned
the brekkians show no sign of infection the ornarans show all the symptoms of a disease but i cant find a cause
perhaps it was filtered out by the transporter when they were beamed aboard
theres no record of it then again the solar flare activity might have caused a malfunction in the biofilters or their monitors
are they going to die
i need to check further but my instinct says no
do you think we are in danger from this plague
again i need more time
there are some missing pieces to this puzzle
whats missing is a little compassion
are we losing our professional detachment doctor
perhaps but captain i must tell you im developing a very active dislike for these brekkians
understandable

captain you must give us back our cargo
i cant do that
why it belongs to us
the brekkians claim it belongs to them
they lie
that may be so but its not my decision
we need some now now i dont care if its your decision get us some
captain what is happening to us is happening to thousands more on ornara please understand the magnitude of the problem
your people dont need it the brekkians dont need it our people do
if you dont give it to us you will be a party to murder not only of us but of an entire civilisation im sorry i do not mean to insult you im feeling very shaky
we cannot hold out much longer
they believe it will help them that in itself might control their symptoms
ill talk with the brekkians
thank you captain we appreciate anything you can do


may i say captain how impressed we are with your ship and all its facilities
thank you
and its crew everyone is so efficient and professional
i am glad you are comfortable ive come to seek your agreement to an ornaran request
we cannot agree
wait let the captain speak we want to be reasonable
the two ornarans are really quite ill and insisting that they need felicium
that is not surprising
would you object to giving them enough for their own immediate needs
captain we brekkians are in business we are not in the habit of giving away what has not been paid for
you would see them die rather than share the medicine
we want to be fair captain we agree to permitting them two dosages for immediate use
no charge
ill let my medical officer handle it
captain i trust you wont mind if were present while you open the cargo


what does that device do
this measures the individual portions

whats the dosage
point zero one millilitres
very potent substance
weve improved our distillation process over the years
in my grandfathers day the same amount of felicium would have filled five rooms this size
but now with our improved processes this one barrel contains over four billion doses
i would estimate four billion three hundred seventy five million
thank you mister data
how long is the dosage effective
it varies with the individual
but never more than seventy two hours
and then the symptoms return
yes unfortunately there is no cure for the plague
but felicium inhibits the sickness with total efficiency
allowing the ornarans to lead normal lives
an unusual disease virulent extremely persistent yet i cant isolate it
the plague has baffled doctors on both planets for two hundred years
weve therefore concentrated on treatment finding new ways to improve the potency and purity of felicium
no doubt you have applied your technology from other industries to the refinement of this product
we have no other industry
none at all
we dont need any the ornarans provide us everything we need in exchange for this
fascinating your society is dedicated exclusively to the production of a single product
a product for which you have no use but which the ornarans cant live without
one of the little ironies of life captain
but one wed be fools not to take advantage of its mutually beneficial
the ornarans provide us with the necessities of life and we provide them with the necessities of living it is a fair exchange
interesting relationship
excuse me ill take that to sickbay


can i help
no

hurry up

youre feeling better
yes thank you im fine now

come

doctor
i may not know feliciums full effect on ornarian physiology but i know how to interpret physical reactions
are the ornarans recovering
tjon and romas are feeling fine in fact too fine feliciums a narcotic
then tjon and romas indeed everyone on their world
is a drug addict

i think youll find its a fascinating tale that weve come across here captain
youve piqued my interest number one please continue
data what have we got
beginning several thousand years ago the two worlds took different paths ornara became technologically sophisticated brekka did not then two hundred years ago ornara was stricken by a devastating plague
their advanced technology could provide no solution
somehow and there is limited information on this point the cure was found in a plant indigenous to only brekka and which resisted all attempts at cultivation on ornara
in any case a trading situation developed which still exists
a nice arrangement for the brekkians
and for the ornarans without the medicine they would all die
no they wouldnt despite what the ornarans have been saying its not a medicine it was a medicine but it cured the plague two hundred years ago the plague is irrelevant now it doesnt exist
then why are they so desperate for the felicium
its an addiction the physical and psychological need is very real
thank you
what are you going to do
based on what we know so far theres nothing i can do
you dont think drug addiction and exploitation is sufficient cause to do something
this situation has existed for a very long time these two societies are intertwined in a symbiotic relationship
with one society profiting at the expense of the other
thats how you see it
i can synthesise a nonaddictive substitute which will ease their withdrawal symptoms
no i cant do that either
you cant let them have the felicium
why because it offends against our sensibilities it is not our mission to impose federation or earth values on any others in the galaxy
well in this case captain i disagree one hundred percent
captain im receiving a call from ornara the signal is ragged but i think i can put it on the viewscreen
do it
im margan are my people on board your ship
some of them yes
may i speak to them
yes lieutenant yar have the ornarans brought in no wait i dont want them to have access to the bridge we will contact you in a few minutes  i will continue this in the guest quarters commander doctor

data i can understand how this could happen to the ornarans what i cant understand is why anyone would voluntarily become dependent on a chemical
voluntary addiction to drugs is a recurrent theme in many cultures
wesley no one wants to become dependent that happens later
but it does happen so why do people start
on my home planet there was so much poverty and violence that for some the only escape was through drugs
how can a chemical substance can provide an escape
it doesnt but it makes you think it does you have to understand drugs can make you feel good they make you feel on top of the world youre happy sure of yourself in control
but its artificial
it doesnt feel artificial until the drug wears off then you pay the price before you know it youre taking the drug not to feel good but to keep from feeling bad
and thats the trap
all you care about is getting your next dosage nothing else matters
i guess i just dont understand
wesley i
well always have paris

captains log stardate  were en route to sarona eight for much needed shore leave the entire crew is looking forward to the diversion on a personal note i have allowed myself the luxury of a head start


i took advantage
no no lieutenant the advantage was yours come again en garde

interesting move sir but what technique was that
the technique of a desperate man

interesting move sir but what technique was that
the technique of a desperate man
captain what was that
picard to bridge
captain
number one did something unusual just occur on the bridge
yes sir we experienced some kind of loop where everything repeats itself
here too im on my way

 report mister data
sensors show nothing sir but it appears a moment in time repeated itself exactly for everyone
just like a feeling of deja vu
reports from all decks coming in sir
computers were also affected which would indicate the phenomenon was not an illusion but occurred in real time
number one find out if anything similar happened in this sector
sir i am receiving an emergency transmission from the pegos minor system
put it on
five four two point two i repeat this is doctor paul manheim we are in need of help urgent all ships please respond i repeat coordinates are six six seven two eight point nine
it is an automated signal sir i am unable to establish contact
shut it off mister la forge lay in a course on those coordinates
aye sir
captain you act as if theres a connection between the time distortion and the distress signal
there is paul manheim fifteen years ago he went off to work on experiments relating to nonlinear time it appears he may have achieved some measure of success speed warp eight
aye sir warp eight
engage
estimated arrival pegos minor four hours thirty five minutes seventeen seconds
ive never heard of paul manheim
mister data
a highly respected scientist considered a visionary he advanced several timerelated theories one regarding the relationships between time and gravity was quite intriguing but neither that theory nor any other received wide acceptance
fifteen years ago he assembled a team of scientists to expand that research they disappeared havent been heard from since
did you know him captain
i knew of him he was teaching at the university when i was in paris but i didnt have the pleasure i must change number one inform me half an hour before we reach those coordinates keep trying to determine if the time distortion was specifically located on the enterprise
yes sir
captain excuse me
yes what is it counsellor
i think you would prefer to discuss this in private
thats not necessary go on
when professor manheims name was mentioned you reacted with intense emotion
yes please get to the point
i dont want to interfere with your personal life but unresolved strong emotion can affect judgement
well thank you for your concern
as ships counsellor i offer my assistance
what do you suggest
confronting deep personal issues is not easy for you you tend to suppress them there are a few hours until we arrive perhaps you should use this time to analyse your feelings and put them into perspective
thank you counsellor if i should need you further ill let you know


bridge belay that computer estimated arrival at pegos minor
two hours nine minutes
holodeck three

computer this is captain picard
holodeck three is clear
location paris cafe des artistes as it appeared twenty two years ago april the ninth fifteen hundred hours three oclock warm spring day
programme complete


monsieur welcome to the cafe des artistes is this your first time in paris
no
this way
that table
mais oui bien sur monsieur we are here to please you

ive been away far too long
some wine some cheese
im not very hungry i really came for the view
perhaps what you hunger for is not on the menu
perhaps not it was many years ago i had a rendezvous i was to meet someone someone here at this very table
your young lady she did not come
actually i dont know i always imagined that she did
you however did not ah well trust edouard i will bring something very special just for you

lets go weve waited long enough
fine you go ill stay a little longer
hes not coming gabrielle
no after last night i know he will i just know
then he would be here you are making a fool out of yourself and i will not watch

do we know each other
no
the way you look at me do i remind you of someone
no yes you do somewhat
hes not coming why what did i do to drive him away
maybe you did nothing maybe he had no choice maybe he was afraid
of what of me
oh of being connected rooted perhaps if hes as young as you are he doesnt know yet exactly what he wants to do maybe enough of this selfindulgence exit

captain weve received communication from the freighter lalo as well as from a farming colony on coltar four both described the same time distortion the captain of the lalo described it a hiccup
hiccup
actually sir that may be an incorrect analogy
how so data
a hiccup is a spasmodic inhalation with closure of the glottis accompanied by a peculiar sound if we were to continue this analogy to a body function what occurred would be best represented by a
thats enough data have you been able to learn more specifics about the manheim project
all i have found sir is what you already know manheim was concentrating on time gravity experiments when he left
captain weve reached the coordinates specified theres nothing here
im receiving new coordinates its a relay signal same source as the first one
what are they worf
six six four point eight by one three two three point seven by four nine four nine point nine
very remote area sir its in the middle of the vandor system a binary star system main stars a b class giant the companion stars a pulsar
set course for the new coordinates mister la forge
aye sir
why is he making it this difficult to find him
hopefully hell tell us number one

we have reached the coordinates captain
sensors indicate it is vandor four a planetoid in elliptical orbit around the binary system
standard orbit mister la forge
aye sir
give me a visual
viewscreen on theres a small forcefield on the planet latitude twenty degrees nine minutes north longitude forty degrees two minutes east of the present terminator
penetrable
no sir
open hailing frequencies
hailing frequencies open sir
this is captain this is the captain of the uss enterprise responding to your signal for help
enterprise thank you for hearing us where are you
were in orbit around vandor now
then you can help me i dont know what to do its only the two of us left hes having convulsions please
can you lock on to her coordinates
no sir the forcefield is preventing any kind of contact other than audio
there is a force field at your location
yes i know
good but it is preventing us from helping you now you must find some way to shut it down
ill try
force field is off
good lock onto their coordinates beam them up directly to sickbay doctor crusher prepare for a medical emergency two to beam directly up to sickbay
well be ready captain
thats where ill be number one mister data


ill help easy easy

ive got his legs how long has he been like this
several hours at least he was in his lab so i cant be sure
i need to do some tests

er i er
jeanluc i thought the voice sounded familiar
hello
i should have known who else would have charged to my rescue
this is my first officer commander william riker lieutenant commander data this is jenice manheim
a pleasure mrs manheim
thank you
i have a number of questions for you
i hope i can be of some help
why dont we sit down

you said there were only two of you left what happened to the rest of the crew
they were working in the second lab something happened there a few weeks ago they were all killed it was a terrible accident i dont know exactly what happened so many brilliant wonderful minds just gone
do you know the nature of doctor manheims work
pauls always been interested in time hes never believed that it was immutable any more than space is immutable over the last decade he came to believe that we reside in one of infinite dimensions and what holds us here is the constancy of time change that and it would be what he called opening the window to those other dimensions
which begins to explain what happened
have you been experiencing something up here
yes what is emanating here is having repercussions light years away maybe even further
that would explain his anxiety i had no idea it had gone so far beyond vandor
why this place why vandor
all i can tell you about that is paul and the rest of the team searched for two years to find it vandors exactly what they needed a planetoid around a binary star
because of the dense gravity of the pulsar
did your husband ever attempt to define these dimensions give you an idea of what he expected
no but he did say that he was very close to proving his theories and then the accident
did he anticipate that these experiments might be dangerous
i didnt think so now in retrospect he probably did that would explain all the unusual precautions he began taking even before the accident the force field the elaborate security system every time he started a new experiment he insisted that i stay in what he said called a protected room
ah and thats why you werent affected
jeanluc he would never knowingly do anything to hurt anyone
yes i believe that
but as he saw his goal getting closer seeming possible he became more and more obsessive maybe that clouded his judgement this is not how i imagined seeing you again
nor i you
youve done well a great starship in the far reaches of the galaxy its everything youd hoped
not exactly nothing works just as you hope if you cant tell us any more i need to send a team down to the lab
you cant its protected one of the other scientists made sure no one could get in
excuse me
is he worse
hes resting but id like you to undergo some tests as well my nurse will start them
thank you for your kindness doctor

shes an old friend
i gathered that its her husband im more concerned with at the moment
whats the prognosis
i believe hes dying his neurochemistrys been affected but i dont know how or why ive never encountered anything like it before
how long does he have
maybe a couple of days its hard to predict all i can do is maintain him or attempt to maintain him until i find out whats causing the damage
can we talk to him
not now not yet


incidentally captain the effects of the time distortions are now being felt in the ilecom system

bridge in the past decade manheim has turned some vague theories into a practical application
yes but without his help im not sure well be able to pose any intelligent questions let alone come up with any solutions

incidentally captain the effects of the time distortions are now being felt in the ilecom system
its us before we stepped into the turbolift
its happening again
i feel no disorientation
nor do i


what was that
i believe what could be termed the manheim effect is becoming more pronounced
this is where we started if we are us
oh we are us sir but they are also us so indeed we are both us at different points along the same time continuum

bridge

what have you learned
we have completed a scan of the planet surface
weve discovered the second lab is on the far side of the planet completely destroyed unable to determine what caused it otherwise very little to clarify the situation
our sensors show an immense volume of energy emanating deep within the planet and concentrated near manheims remaining laboratory
how is the energy being used
no idea
whats its source
i cannot be sure sir but i believe manheim has developed a method for harnessing energy from the pulsar
it comes down to this captain weve learned everything we can from here and we are no closer to understanding it than we were twelve hours ago manheim is unable to help us but hopefully having been a good scientist he kept notes
i would need to study manheims records
and in order to do that were going to have to go down there
what about the defence system mrs manheim spoke of
it may have been connected to the main system and when she lowered the shield she may have turned that off as well if not well deal with it as best we can
prepare your team
aye sir

coordinates set
yes sir
energise
theres a lack of integrity at the landing point

im losing them
bring them back now chief herbert whats going on

there seems to be some kind of strange bouncing effect

i cant get them to materialise my readings arent complete
keep trying


what are we doing back here
youre lucky you made it back at all sir

where am i
paul thank god youre on the uss enterprise they answered your distress signal
i sent one
oh paul youre going to be just fine
i am not fine jenice im not even close to fine
bridge this is doctor crusher professor manheim is conscious
remember it was worth it what happened what will happen all of it it was all worth it again its changing again
what is what do you see
im having difficulty
with what are you in pain
i have been on the other side i have touched another dimension part of me is still there
help him
try to stay calm doctor manheim i dont think its going to help you struggling against it
my mind is floating between two places it is difficult to know which is which there is no way to explain it

doctor manheim im captain picard
the same one  she has told me about you not all but enough
we need your help the situation is not good
it will get worse
what do we do how do we stop it
im having difficulty holding the moment
doctor this is lieutenant commander data will you explain the situation to him
i am fully versed sir on all your theories regarding time and gravity
how is that possible i am not even fully versed on all of my theories
i am an android
android on a starfleet vessel
i am the only one sir
your knowledge is useless because the work we have done here has made most of those theories obsolete
then you have harnessed a dynamic energy source
then you do understand yes we were able to locate an energy source in the centre of this planetoid we learned to enhance it to focus it everything worked too well the energy from the pulsar the energy from the planetoid we opened a crack a window into another dimension
the time distortion we felt
felt then it is not confined to the planetoid
the range is at least several thousand light years
captain it must be stopped you must help me to execute a controlled shut down of this experiment get my notes theyre in the lab
how do we bypass the security system
ill give you the correct coordinates to beam safely down to vandor and the codes you need to bypass security systems to get into my lab

if what the professor has given me is accurate it is possible to repair the damage but it must be perfectly timed to coincide with another time distortion episode
can we predict the timing
i believe so sir
we have to if we dont seal that hole this other dimension hes opened will rip into the fabric of the galaxy reality as we perceive it will not be the same lieutenant worf
yes sir
i want those codes that manheim gave mister data rechecked and then checked again no one is beaming down to vandor unless we can be reasonably sure they can get through
aye sir

im sorry for intruding i was told id find you here
youre not intruding were just finished come in thank you

i knew you wouldnt come to me
no not under these circumstances
we have unfinished business
yes we do
why didnt you come to meet me that last day in paris
i was afraid
oh i didnt want this
what
the truth
oh you want me to lie
of course a nice soft painless lie
oh i got the days confused i thought it was tuesday when it was wednesday i went to the cafe moulin instead of the cafe des artistes
ah thats better it was raining and you couldnt find a cab i waited all day and it was raining it rained the rest of the week i went to starfleet headquarters looking for you but youd already shipped out so come on jeanluc lets hear the truth
it was fear fear of seeing you losing my resolve fear of staying losing myself fear that neither of these choices was right and that and that either would have
for a long time not a day went by when i didnt look up into the sky and wonder
each time that i returned to earth my thoughts were filled with you
ive thought a lot about this over the years and perhaps youre leaving out your greatest fear the real reason you left
which was
that life with me would have somehow made you ordinary
youre wonderful and am i that transparent
only to me

i wish i could talk to you professor manheim i bet you were really something

deanna
i wanted to see how he was doing
the same nothing i do seems to make any difference thats not why youre here
i thought i was the empath

are you all right
why wouldnt i be ive got one of the medical wonders of the galaxy dying in my sickbay
thats not what i meant
i dont think i want to talk about what i think you mean
captain picard
i cant compete with a ghost from his past no one could
shes not a ghost shes here right now
she may be in the here and now but its the ghost he sees excuse me i have to get back to my patient

how soon mister data
if doctor manheims information is correct by my calculations the next time distortion should occur between twenty eight to forty seven minutes
bridge this is sickbay

doctor manheim is awake and asking to speak with you captain alone

on my way doctor

you asked for me
i am not sure i remembered all of the codes for the security system you should warn anyone going down there
thank you ill tell them to be cautious
what i really wanted to talk to you about is jenice
doctor manheim i did not come here to discuss your wife
it is only this if anything should go wrong please take care of her for me
of course
she never would admit this but she has had a terrible time these last years had we not been so isolated she might have left me and i never would have known at least not right away perhaps im not a man who should have a woman like her she deserves better
you underestimate her i know because i once did

in both cases the time distortions occurred along the same continuum as a preview or a reprise of a specific point in time
where we are where we were and where we will be data i want this to be an away team of one you i dont think theres any reason to risk anyone else
it is reasonable sir after all i am a machine and dispensable
indispensable is the appropriate word i think it should be only you because you seem more able to control the effects of the time distortion
oh i see sir that is quite true sir i see time as a constant whereas humans perceive time as flexible hence the expression times flies when youre having fun which until now has always confused me
well i want you to put a stitch in time and er save much more than nine
sir
if other members of the away team became disoriented it could create additional problems and perhaps increase the danger
i will go immediately sir
good luck data

all right we have the coordinates exactly as the professor specified


enterprise
picard
i am proceeding to the lab sir
maintain an open frequency mister data
aye sir


mister data whats going on

doctor manheim forgot to mention one of his security precautions sir i am proceeding into the laboratory


mister data this channel will remain open please continue to report
this appears to be the instrument doctor manheim described it should confirm when the next time effect will occur
data

did manheim give you enough information to decipher the security code

i will know in a moment sir according to calculations the next time effect will occur in one minute thirty seconds

whats the next step mister data

i will need to add a specific amount of antimatter to rebalance and align the system
will that plug the hole
theoretically yes in reality i do not know

when the effect hits the forcefields will align opening a clean straight path to the other dimension whatever the time distortion i must add the antimatter at the appropriate moment geordi if the professor was right i will need a twenty seven second countdown
you got it data
captain i now have the antimatter and am moving towards the opening at the end of the lab the next time distortion should occur within seconds geordi begin countdown on my mark now

captain there appear to be three of us
should i drop the antimatter or wait for one of you
only one of us is at the correct time continuum
which one
me its me
five four three two one

data report are you all right
yes sir
is it closed
it is well patched sir closed indicates a permanent condition which i cannot guarantee

patched is good enough well done beam back immediately

with pleasure sir

this is amazing all your readings are completely normal

where is my wife is she all right
shes right here
jenice
paul
the effect has been reversed i can feel it were safe
how is he
he needs rest there might be some residual effects but other than that hell be all right
i feel like im coming out of a long tunnel its there not at all like i thought it would be different
describe it
i cant not yet the only words that fit are too pale because the images are so vibrant its not like anything anyone has ever experienced before there was no no there is this kind of life not like us not like this whats the condition of my lab
intact for the most part
dont tell me were going back
oh jenice we are so close we have learned so much to walk away besides we owe it to the others our friends there have been so many sacrifices by so many good people
well be going back
yes i can see that im sure the federation will want to help in any way that it can
thank you this time it will be different i promise
it always is my love you said my life would never be dull and it never has been
thank you


computer this is counsellor troi request access
do you wish to terminate the current programme
no continue the programme
enter when ready
the captain is waiting for you inside

how is this possible its paris unbelievable
madame this way the captain is waiting for you

this is so real
bien sur pourquoi pas
jeanluc dont tell me how you did it i dont care its perfect its as if we were really there
i wanted to say goodbye properly this time i shall always picture you here

i expect you to always come charging to my rescue
ill do my best
goodbye jeanluc be well
and you
thank you for paris

well so much for my dramatically romantic exit


is anything wrong
no sir
then set course for sarona eight as i remember we were on our way for some much needed shore leave
course set and laid in sir
warp five engage
ive only been there once but theyve got this great club i dont remember the name of it they serve these blue concoctions
its across the square from the zanza mens dance palace
its called the blue parrot cafe  and youre buying
conspiracy

first officers log stardate  we are en route to the ocean world of pacifica while our mission is scientific in nature we look forward to the warm blue waters and fine beaches that make pacifica a jewel of the galaxy

so the guy staggers to his feet and goes back to the girl right well she smiles looks him right in the eye and says just try that in hyperspace

i see so the difficulty in attaining such complex positioning in zero gravity environment coupled with the adverse effect it would have on the psychological well being of the average human male is what makes this anecdote so amusing yes very humorous indeed hysterical in fact

what is our eta at pacifica mister la forge
twenty two hours fourteen minutes sir
increase to warp six
aye sir full impulse
do you think anyone would object to our arriving ahead of schedule
i know i wont ive been really looking forward to a nice swim
you are aware counsellor that the holodeck can be programmed to recreate an oceanic environment
data its just not the same have you ever been for a real moonlight swim
one can swim in moonlight
how about you mister worf
swimming is too much like bathing
commander riker i am receiving a code forty seven
verify
it is a code forty seven sir starfleet emergency frequency
code forty seven captains eyes only


captain im sorry to disturb you
yes number one what is it
an incoming message code forty seven sir
pipe it through
this is an emergency communiqu it is not to be discussed with fellow officers unless deemed absolutely necessary there will be no computer record of said transmission
understood
proceed with voice print identification
picard jeanluc captain uss enterprise
voice print verified
walker
hello jeanluc its been a long time
too long old friend why are you contacting me on this frequency
it was a difficult decision i felt it was worth the risk
risk
its about starfleet about something weve always considered to be impossible
i dont understand
i cant explain it now we need to talk face to face
youre using a code forty seven i have to know what this is all about
not over subspace no
oh for gods sake walker this is a secured channel
no i want you to meet me on dytallix b
when
immediately
not possible were expected at pacifica
that can wait you owe me and you owe it to yourself to hear what i have to say something is beginning dont trust anyone remember that jeanluc dont take anything for granted
walker
dytallix b well be waiting

data are you familiar with dytallix b
dytallix b is one of seven uninhabited planets mined for the federation by the dytallix mining company it is in the nearby mira system
mister la forge chart a course for it immediately warp seven and there will be no records or logs mentioning any aspect of this diversion
captain theyre expecting us at pacifica shouldnt we contact them and let them know
negative nothing goes out without specific orders from me hopefully the delay will be minimal

i have the readout on dytallix b commander
what have you got
dytallix b is the fifth of six planets circling the red giant known as mira one side always faces the sun where temperatures reach up to one hundred and eighty degrees the mines line the temperate zone between the day and night sides but they are long deserted
why the devil are we be going to this planet are there any miners or indigenous life forms on the planet
i believe the answer to both questions is no sir in a manner of speaking it is nothing but a lifeless hunk of rock a useless ball of mud a worthless chunk
thank you data i get the idea captain we are approaching dytallix b
very good number one im on my way

captain sensors are detecting three federation starships already in orbit around the planet
identify
two are frigates the renegade commanded by tryla scott and the thomas paine captain rixx commanding
the third is just coming into range now sir it is ambassador class heavy cruiser uss horatio
horatio isnt that walker keels ship
attempts at communication have been ignored by all three vessels
make no further attempts mister worf any life form readings on the surface data
three sir all gathered inside what appears to be the entrance to a mining tunnel
very well relay those coordinates to the transporter room im beaming down
alone captain
alone number one


thanks for coming
this is some greeting old friend
tell me jeanluc where did we first meet
 answer the question
tau ceti three it was a bar quite an exotic one as i remember what do i win
do you recall the night you introduced jack crusher to beverly
you know full well i hadnt even met beverly then you introduced them
my brother introduced them
you dont have a brother two sisters anne and melissa what the hell is this all about

apologies captain we had to make sure you were really you
walker what is going on
captain picard meet captain rixx
i believe weve met the altairian conference
and captain scott
tryla scott its said you made captain faster than anyone in starfleet history present company included are you that good
yes i am
starfleets finest fancy meeting you here
we all came secretly picard to discuss the threat
what threat
have you noticed anything about starfleet command lately anything unusual
no but weve been on the outer rim for a while we havent had much contact with them
some of us have seen strange patterns emerging unusual orders highranking officials backing irrational proposals
starbase twelve was completely evacuated for two full days no explanation given
and what about the deaths mckinney ryan sipe onna karapleedeez
all dead
a series of accidents
or so they say its hard to be certain of anything interfleet communications are at a minimum but something is happening
and we fully expect the enterprise to be targeted soon
targeted for what by whom
were not sure yet damn it jeanluc i tell you that some of starfleets top command people are changing this could affect the very core of our organisation officers ive known for years are bluffing their way through talk of old times
thats their weakness a lack of memory
he doesnt believe us he thinks were crazy
youve given me nothing to believe in just a lot of vague talk about strange patterns irrational proposals whos behind this and to what purpose how are people being changed
i cant say exactly but i think its spread to my own ship my first officer hasnt been the same since we stopped off at earth our medical officer says hes perfectly normal but i dont think i trust him either
walker
we know we dont have all the answers all we ask is that you keep your eyes open
thats sound advice at any time captain
stay in touch with us covertly this meeting never took place as far as starfleet is concerned please im asking this as a personal favour im glad jeanluc im glad youre still one of us tell beverly i said hello
and watch your back picard

friends close friends are few and far between two of the oldest and closest are jack crusher may he rest in peace and walker keel before various missions split us apart we were virtually inseparable i trust keel completely if he felt it necessary to violate regulations he must have had a good reason
but youre putting your career at risk for him
friendship must dare to risk counsellor or its not friendship
they illicitly used the emergency channel to draw you here then they asked you to keep secrets from your superiors effectively to disobey starfleet regulations
the people involved in this are of the highest calibre if i didnt believe in their loyalty i wouldnt have gone this far
dont you think you should tell the rest of the crew
no i dont want to risk implicating them not until i have solid evidence that something really is wrong

take us out of orbit mister la forge
aye sir
resume heading to pacifica warp factor eight
aye sir warp eight
at that speed sir we should arrive nine point six three hours behind the original schedule sir
very good data i have an assignment for you one especially suited to your talents

computer this is lieutenant commander data please access all starfleet command orders to starships starbases and colonies for the past six months
working

doctor
i understand the horatio was in orbit around dytallix did you see walker
no
oh i would have loved to have seen him
it wasnt possible doctor
captain i am picking up an unusual disturbance in a nearby quadrant
confirmed sir sector sixty three
specify what kind of disturbance
hard to say at this distance sir
i guess the trip pacifica will have to wait
lets investigate maintain speed alter course accordingly
aye sir changing course to three five one mark four

approaching sector sixty three sir
slow to impulse
aye sir going to impulse power now
sensors beginning to pick up small objects sir
on screen

it doesnt look natural
agreed enlarge and identify
it looks like debris from a space vessel of some kind
it could be one of those ships that was orbiting dytallix
we are in close proximity to that planet
identifying marks mister worf
nothing so far sensors not detecting any bodies in the flotsam but from the amount of wreckage im sorry sir it can only be the horatio from the looks of it shes been totally destroyed
captains personal log stardate  the apparent death of walker keel has had a powerful impact on me i now believe there may be a cancer growing within the ranks of starfleet as a result i have alerted my executive officer to the suspicions voiced by keel and the others

theres no proof of anything
the last time i saw admiral quinn he tried to warn me about a subversion within the federation then walker tried and hes dead
subversion personally i dont believe this conspiracy theory


startling quite extraordinary in fact
directions unclear please repeat request
that was not a request i was simply talking to myself a human idiosyncrasy triggered by fascination with a particular set of facts or sometimes brought about by senility or used as a means of weighing information before reaching a conclusion or as a
thank you sir i comprehend please specify how you would like to proceed sir
please continue with record scan intriguing

but we have no facts we have to assume the explosion was an accident

number one i believe what happened on the horatio was sabotage
but we cant be certain
perhaps we can my orders were to search for abnormal patterns in starfleets directives i believe i have found just that

these are various outposts and starbases where i have detected unusual activity over the past few months
what sort of activity
an uncustomary reshuffling of personnel usually in the command areas the new officers have had frequent contact with the highest levels of starfleet command
why hasnt anybody discovered this before
the orders were given with great subtlety to use an aphorism starfleets left hand did not know what its right hand was doing
data can you speculate as to the purpose of these reassignments
i believe it is a clandestine attempt to control vital sectors of federation territory
this could be a prelude to an invasion but whos behind it
there is insufficient data to make such an assessment sir
are you suggesting that we warp over to starfleet headquarters and demand to know whats going on
why not
yes why not were talking about a threat to the entire future of the federation i dont think any of us can rest easy until weve been to the source
captains personal log supplemental while it is quite unusual for a starship to return to earth we seem to be left with no other choice i have apprised the remaining bridge crew of our situation

approaching earth sir
standard orbit mister la forge
standard orbit sir
any word from starfleet command data
nothing so far sir
strange

captain i am now receiving a message from starfleet command
on screen

greetings enterprise i am admiral savar this is admiral aaron and i believe you already know admiral quinn
yes indeed its good to see you again admiral
and you captain
of course we are always delighted when the enterprise returns to the nest yet we are puzzled by the timing of your visit
yes sir i can imagine you would be
governor delaplane of pacifica informs us that you cancelled your scheduled stop there is this true
yes sir it is
explain yourself captain why have you returned to earth
i would rather discuss in person admiral

excuse us for one moment captain
they seem normal enough
on the surface counsellor any thoughts
hard to say someone is hiding something but i cant tell who or what
i must say im not overjoyed to see remmick again
considering what weve done their response has been pretty temperate
i dont like it you cant trust them
forgive the delay captain picard wed be delighted if you and your first officer would join us for dinner
yes delighted
it would give you a good opportunity to expatiate your viewpoint
to elaborate upon whatever it is thats troubling you
thank you we accept your gracious offer
excellent preparations are already underway
well greet you in the reception area in say twenty minutes
splendid
i wont be able to attend dinner im afraid but i would like to see the ship and say hello again captain
of course we look forward to seeing you admiral enterprise out quinn wants to see us alone at least we know hes still on our side mister data you have the bridge
aye sir


are you ready to beam up to the enterprise sir
yes commander quite ready energise mister remmick

welcome aboard greg
good to see you
you remember commander riker
hello again commander
i must say youre looking remarkably well
never felt better in my life
when you were here last you were saying that you were feeling tired
tired of life i was but not anymore im ready for new challenges now what about another look at this ship

remember what you told me back at relva seven about the threat that you perceived to the very fabric of the federation
is that why youre here because of what i said
its one of the reasons yes
but jeanluc you took me far too literally i was only referring to the problems involved in assimilating new races into the federation its an ongoing tumultuous process which can cause stress and strain on every aspect of our alliance
im sorry i must have misunderstood
its not for you to apologise if i led you up the garden path i humbly ask your forgiveness
of course
now gentlemen you have a dinner to attend to while i would like to go and freshen up before i look around a little bit more
weve arranged your usual accommodation sir
thats outstanding
yes i should be getting down to the planet commander riker will be available here to show you anything that you want to see
its really not necessary
i insist  when youve finished showing the admiral anything that he needs you can join me down on earth
i may want to stay a while jeanluc
of course stay as long as you wish  no

its not gregory quinn it may look like him and sound like him but it isnt him
are you absolutely certain captain
im certain number one i want you to stay close keep your eye on his every move have beverly concoct some reason for giving him a full medical examination
how
i dont know just do it
hes a senior admiral
its not him will i know that now what i have to find out is how this happened and who or what is behind it
captain if youre right
im right
should you be beaming down there alone unarmed
ill take care find out what you can then join me in force if necessary energise
good luck sir

welcome home captain picard
thank you sir my first officer will be joining us shortly
yes im sure he will
youve met commander remmick havent you
under less than ideal circumstances its nice to see you again captain
weve prepared a special meal in your honour
delightful tell me why is the corridor so quiet the last time i was here it was bustling with activity
it usually is tonights a quiet night
yes a quiet night

ready for your tour admiral
quite ready commander
whats in the case
actually i brought it for doctor crusher but perhaps you would like you to see it first
what is it
a form of life it was discovered accidentally by a survey team on an uncharted planet
why havent we heard anything about that
oh youll be hearing about it shortly but first there remains much scientific study to be done after all it is a superior form of life
superior
totally come have a look
i think ill summon my science officer

it wont like your science officer it does like you vitamins they do wonders for the body

riker to security guest quarters seventeen emergency


lets have some andonian tea while we wait for your riker then you can tell us about whats brought you here
i see you keep up with our duty roster
yes of course captain the enterprise is very important to us
excuse me gentlemen

to the horatio gentlemen
the horatio

what an awful tragedy such a terrible loss of life
its interesting that you should mention the horatio its one of the subjects i wanted to discuss
really
has the cause of her destruction been ascertained
absolutely implosion due to extreme negligence on the part of her captain
enjoy picard i believe youll find it an excellent aperitif


its good thing youre here he slipped and hit his head
this is lieutenant la forge in guest quarter seventeen we have a medical emergency
your doctor crusher is most capable im sure hell be all right now if youll excuse me my time here is most limited
admiral dont you think we should wait until the doctor gets here

now klingon its between you and me

do klingons fear death as much as humans i could snap your neck in a second but it wouldnt be as much fun

are you all right
if i could see id be seeing stars
what is he
lets find out

retinal scans are an exact match it really is quinn
how can that be the man picked me up like a rag doll
im going to have to do a complete internal scan
keep me posted doctor ill be on the bridge

what is that


what do you know of conspiracies captain
not nearly enough i suppose
thats the charming thing about them isnt it when a machination is real no one knows about it and when its suspected its almost never real
except of course in paranoid delusions for those who believe
sorry to interrupt dinner is served
wonderful bantering with the captain has given me quite an appetite
i need to contact my ship to let commander riker that were about to sit down
of course captain well wait for you at the table

picard to riker
doctor crusher here captain

may i speak freely

i suppose i have little choice wheres riker
he was attacked by quinn or what we thought was quinn
specify doctor

a parasitic being has invaded quinns body it has complete control over all brain functions it seems to breath through a small gill protruding from the back of quinns neck

look for this captain i believe it will be visible on anyone who has been compromised
any idea what it is or where it comes from
negative

ive never seen anything like it before
lieutenant worf if the situation is under control please report to the bridge
doctor
its okay he wont be waking up for a long time

continue doctor
by the placement of the tendrils

the parasite appears to stimulate the victims adrenal glands generate great strength

and resistance to the
never mind the details can you remove it
i dont think so

not without killing the patient captain

you must set your phaser on kill stun has little effect
doctor one does not beam down to starfleet headquarters armed
your food is getting cold captain
im going in to dinner now doctor tell commander riker to join me as soon as hes ready picard out


please sit down captain weve been waiting go ahead and start captain we dont stand on ceremony here

oh do eat up picard raise your hand if you want seconds

riker thank god were leaving
youre not going anywhere youll be one of us soon
you were meant for the doctor
it couldnt be helped riker walked in on us unexpectedly

no matter the doctor will soon be joining us all in good time

well captain scott good now the setting is complete
you dont really think we were in the dark about your intentions do you
patience is one of our virtues captain we didnt go after you we allowed you to come after us
more dramatic that way dont you think
yes the one thing both races share is a love of theatre and youve put on a fine show
what race are you where are you from
its not important let us just say weve come a long way to join you
its a perfect match were the brains youre the brawn
youll understand soon picard
indeed weve been moving slowly cautiously for many months now careful to cover our tracks careful not to arouse suspicion until its too late
and now its too late for you that is
well said brother picard and riker control the enterprise which means we control the enterprise
eat hearty brother relish your new body

aaron

aaron


can i help you gentlemen is there any trouble here perhaps if youd tell me what it is
remmick

no will

you dont understand we mean you no harm we seek peaceful coexistence

captains log stardate  how difficult after all these years of learning to respect life to be forced to destroy it but there seems to be no alternative admiral quinn is expected to make a full recovery there is no trace of the parasite which took control of him well never know how many of these life forms infiltrated starfleet but it seems they could not survive without the mother creature which had taken over commander remmick

it was doctor crushers idea to simulate the blue gill we had to make sure it would fool everyone including you
that it did number one rest assured
captain i have attempted to trace the message remmick was sending i believe it was aimed at an unexplored sector of our galaxy
any idea what the message was data
i believe it was a beacon
a beacon
yes sir a homing beacon sent from earth
the neutral zone

first officers log stardate  we are awaiting the return of captain picard who was summoned to starbase  for an emergency conference meanwhile our sensors are monitoring an ancient capsule floating in our vicinity which appears to be from earth

i wonder how it got out here
at its present speed and heading it will eventually enter the kazis binary system and will certainly be destroyed i could attach a tractor beam and adjust its heading
i think not mister worf its just a piece of space debris if we hadnt sitting here waiting for the captain we wouldnt have noticed it leave it be let nature take its course how long until captain picard returns
the last communication indicated it would be several hours
commander request permission to investigate this vehicle
why data its just a derelict
it is a piece of history the opportunity to examine such an ancient vehicle does not come around very often and as you pointed out we do have the time
very well be prepared to beam back before the captain returns
thank you sir
lieutenant worf go with him
aye sir

minimal oxygen atmosphere an ancient solar generator still operating
commander look at this
the onboard computers have ceased functioning i may be able to download this old style disk drive back to the enterprise

it must be sealed probably with age 
not necessary



the seal was broken and the environment has been corrupted
heres another
this one is empty
commander look at this

were they frozen for an extended journey
if that were the purpose there would be evidence of a more sophisticated monitoring system these containers were designed solely for refrigeration

the captains shuttle is approaching the main shuttlebay sir
 enterprise this is the captain number one i want to get underway as soon as the shuttle is secure
aye sir well make all preparations commander data return to the enterprise immediately
 we have run into an unusual situation sir there are people on board frozen
frozen how many

three the vehicle has suffered severe damage most of her systems have failed

are you suggesting they be transferred to the enterprise

i do not believe we should leave them here sir with your permission we will be returning with three containers
whatever you do do it quickly

mister la forge set course zero five eight mark one seven three
laying it in sir
number one i want a staff meeting on the observation deck
captain those coordinates will take us right into the neutral zone
that is correct mister la forge warp factor eight
aye sir warp eight
engage

two federation outposts in sector three zero have been destroyed theres been no communication with federation starbases in sector three one since stardate 
romulans
thats the assumption
theres been no direct contact with the romulans since the tomed incident
the question are why now whats their objective for fifty years theres barely a whisper out of them and now for no apparent reason they seem to be back with a roar
everything we know about them is based on rumour or conjecture
the strategic decision is to send one ship
the enterprise
we could get out there and find ourselves greatly overmatched
true enough its a gamble
this first encounter coming so suddenly after all this time we have to assume its a setup
if force is necessary we will use it but that will mean we have failed our goal here is to establish some kind of relations with the romulans if we dont succeed then to convince them of our resolve the general feeling at starfleet is that they are seeking a confrontation they may want to test themselves in battle against a federation starship see how far we have advanced if that is the case then i need to know it counsellor i shall need a full profile on them
there is limited information but i will prepare something
computer estimated arrival time at the neutral zone
nineteen hours twenty eight minutes
lets reassemble in six hours stay sharp no surprises i would rather outthink them than outfight them questions

what is it doctor
its the people from the capsule
capsule people what people
the people data beamed over
i wasnt aware that he had
well he did and they were frozen i thawed them
you what
i didnt know what else to do the crypts in which they were frozen were literally falling apart
so whats their condition
right now they are all sleeping each of them needed minor medical attention minor now but then their conditions were obviously terminal one had a heart problem another had an advanced case of emphysema with extensive liver damage you know the most surprising thing of all is that each of them had been frozen after they died
after they died
cryonics it was a kind of fad in the late twentieth century people feared dying it terrified them at the moment of death they would be frozen so that later some time in the future when presumably medical science had a cure for whatever killed them they could be thawed back to life healed and sent on about their business
in the case of this group it apparently worked mister data will you report to sickbay

immediately

look i am never critical of any member of my staff being curious but its just that the timing is so
i could not leave them there captain the condition of their vehicle was deteriorating
but data they were already dead i mean what more could have happened to them
i see your point captain but at the time it seemed the proper thing to do
well theyre alive now were going to have to treat them as living human beings
alive and well and ready to be awakened
before you wake them up i want to have security here lieutenant worf report to sickbay
i have them sedated now but they should be up and about as soon as possible
well then we have no other choice
none that i can see

welcome to the twenty fourth century
i was able to retrieve some information from the ancient disk i removed from the modules computer her name is clare raymond age thirty five occupation homemaker must be some kind of construction work
she died of an embolism it probably happened very suddenly otherwise her physical condition was excellent

his name is ralph offenhouse age fifty five occupation financier
advanced cardiomyopathy inoperable at the time but easily correctable now he must have known his condition was terminal for quite some time

much of his file we could not retrieved his name is l q sonny clemonds apparently his occupation had something to do with music
there was marked deterioration of every system in his body probably from massive chemical abuse unbelievable
that sounds like someone who hated life yet he had himself frozen presumably so he could go through it all again
too afraid to live too scared to die
doctor this seems to be a situation more suited to your talents ill leave it with you ill be on the bridge

number one kindly take charge of our guests until we have time to decide what were going to do with them
aye sir
number one keep them out of my way


i know this is all very confusing to you so ill attempt to explain you are on the starship uss enterprise
american
no its a vessel of the united federation of planets and earth is a member
what year is this
by your calendar two thousand three hundred sixty four
what my heart is it
its perfectly fine in fact you are all now in excellent health
it worked i made it
 what is that
an android
you mean a robot
actually there is a distinct difference between an android and a robot
and him the one i saw before with the head
she means worf
hes a klingon that takes a little more explanation
now listen guys i paid some idiot a lot of money to freeze me when i died and i just got to hear the words am i alive
oh yes absolutely
and the liver that was about to explode in my face
perfectly sound
excuse me could someone please tell me whats going on here
about three hundred and seventy years ago you died of a massive embolism
i dont remember anything about that
you and the others were frozen
cryonics you know freeze you now and heal you later
yeah ive heard of it i just never gave it much thought how did we get here
you were in a space module
the whacko who sold me this scam said that by putting us in orbit there werent gonna be no chance of a brown out
yes several cryonics companies fell into disrepute because of power failures which adversely affected their refrigeration system their stocks were severely depressed
the whole deal was a long shot but i figured what the hell might as well give them the dough instead of leaving it to my exwives but you know son i figured it was all just a bunch of hooey
hooey ah as in hogwash malarky jive an intentional fabrication
there you go now you got it
now if you didnt contract for this who did
it must have been my husband donald if it was new and foolish he would have popped for it well ill say this for it its the first thing hes ever bought into that worked
i for one never had a doubt my stock in this company must have split at least a dozen times by now
actually the process of cryonics was never more than a fad and did not continue much beyond the midtwenty first century
i need to make a phone call as soon as possible
a phone call
yes i have provided for myself i have a substantial portfolio its critical that i check on it let the bank know that i am alive and well
ah thats going to be a little difficult right at the moment
well do you at least have a copy of the wall street journal
i think we should take the doctors advice take this very slowly until weve all adjusted and then well talk to the captain

as you know there is very little available on the romulans
counsellor anything would be helpful
they seem to be creatures of extremes one moment violent beyond description the next tender they are related to the vulcans but as each race developed their differences grew wider they are intensely curious their belief in their own superiority is beyond arrogance for some reason they have exhibited a fascination with humans and it is that fascination more than anything else that has kept the peace one other thing they will not initiate anything they will wait for you to commit yourself
counterpunchers thank you counsellor thats quite valuable


talk
id like me a thick kansas city steak and some country fried potatoes and a mess of greens oh hell just forget all that and give me have a martini straight up with two olives for the vitamins

is there something wrong
wrong only that your computer here fixed about the best martini i have ever had i just might get to like this place lets see if the braves are on how do you turn on this teevee
tv
yeah the boob tube id like to see how the braves are doing after all this time probably still finding ways to lose
i believe he means television sir that particular form of entertainment did not last much beyond the year two thousand forty
well what do you guys do i mean you dont drink and you aint got no tv must be kind of boring aint it
number one
riker here
would you and mister data report to the bridge
at once sir
with whom were you speaking
the captain
good would you tell him i would like to see him as soon as its convenient
whats going to happen to us do we stay here with you do we go back to earth
that will all be up to the captain
well get him in here i have to phone geneva right away about my accounts the interest alone could be enough to buy this ship
the yankees right lets get the big boy in here
ill pass along your request if youll excuse us
duty calls hey i understand  why dont you come back later on you and mell find us a couple of low mileage pit woofies and helpem build a memory

what is to be done with them sir
i dont know
commander a low mileage pit woofie
this time youve got me i havent a clue
these are the most unusual humans i have ever encountered
well from what ive seen of our guests theres not much to redeem them it makes one wonder how our species survived the twentyfirst century

report
we are six hours from the neutral zone i have been unable to establish communications with any federation colony or station in this vicinity
how many outposts are there in this sector
nine
i think we work on the assumption theyve all been destroyed
by the romulans
it fits their historical pattern
since we have no contact with the romulans for fifty three years seven months eighteen days we must consider that the information we do have is out of date
the positive side of that is the information they have about us is also out of date captain i think its that lack of information that this is all about
go on
in my opinion the romulans want a confrontation specifically with us
the enterprise
well not by name but the federation they know the federation will send their best thatll give them a perfect chance to see firsthand how far weve advanced both in technology and technique
what are you recommending
im not sure i have a specific recommendation perhaps we should assume the initiative
i agree with commander riker this may be our only opportunity we should seize it
mister data
the strategy is built on a single premise the hostile intent of the romulans if the premise is sound so is the proposal
if their intention isnt hostile what is it
captain picard
this is captain picard to whom am i speaking
ralph offenhouse

i need to talk to you

what is going on here number one did you give him permission to contact me
of course not he must have seen me use the comm panel
listen mister offenhouse were in a very important conference right now
im sick and tired of being put off

by you and your staff this is the worst run ship i have ever been on

you should take some lessons from the qe two now thats an efficient operation
data identify what is a qe two
it was a passenger liner which mostly travelled earths atlantic ocean during the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries
hes comparing the enterprise to a cruise ship
captain picard i demand that you see me i think i have been very very patient

i demand a phone or a radio whatever else you have frankly enough is enough especially under the circumstances and considering what i paid for this procedure i must make contact with my law

im captain picard
excellent now maybe well be able to get some things straightened out
we may indeed those comm panels are for official ship business
if they are so important why dont they need an executive key
aboard a starship that is not necessary we are all capable of exercising selfdiscipline now you will refrain from using them
now just a minute
we are in a very serious and potentially dangerous situation
im sure whatever it is seems very important to you but my situation is far more critical
i dont think you are aware of your situation or of how much time has passed
believe me im fully cognisant of where i am and when it is simply that i have more to protect than a man in your position could possibly imagine no offence but a military career has never been considered to be upwardly mobile i must contact my lawyer
your lawyer has been dead for centuries
yes of course i know that but he was a full partner in a very important firm rest assured that firm is still operating
thats what this is all about a lot has changed in the past three hundred years people are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of things weve eliminated hunger want the need for possessions we have grown out of our infancy
youve got it all wrong its never been about possessions its about power
power to do what
to control your life your destiny
that kind of control is an illusion
really im here arent i i should be dead but im not

what is it
i dont know it just started and it wont stop i keep thinking about my boys
counsellor troi will you report to the guest lounge
captain we are approaching science station delta zero five
slow to half impulse im on my way
captain i need to see that pretty little doctor of yours
ill inform her
captain i didnt mean to come on so strong its just that ive built my whole life on knowing whats going on for the first time i feel completely out of touch its making me crazy you can understand that
its the first thing youve said i do understand ill see what i can do and please stay off the comm panels

counsellor will you get those people under control we cannot afford this continuing distraction
yes sir


hello my name is deanna
they sent you here to settle me down
im the ships counsellor and i thought you might want to talk
the local shrink
im sorry im not familiar with that term
it doesnt matter
youre feeling profoundly sad
i cant stop crying i miss my sons and then i think im here but they are gone donald thats my husband i love that man but good intentions aside hed mess up a free lunch why on earth he ever decided to do this
he must have thought you would have wanted it
no i can tell you exactly what happened he couldnt think about going on alone i died and he couldnt face it so he figured if he had me frozen then in his mind i wasnt really gone it sounds crazy but you had to know donald i wish i knew what happened to my children did they get married did they have kids
lets see if we can find out computer this is counsellor troi request personal history on what are their names
tommy hes eight and eddies five
full names date and place of birth
they were born in secaucus thats in jersey can this really work can this tell me whats happened to them
well there must be a record somewhere there is a good chance we can find it
well whether we do or not i want to thank you for trying date of birth tommy was born february seventeenth

i just got to have a little something to jump start the morning and a little something else to shut down the night
you have no medical need
it aint a question of need darling its a matter of survival
sorry
not to worry old watoshll scuffle along the best way he can how do i get a hold of that feller with the strange looking face
i beg your pardon
whats his name that android fella
you mean lieutenant commander data
thats the one
ill let him know youre looking for him
much obliged you know youre just about the prettiest little old doctor i ever seen
much obliged


this is amazing its all right here
ten generations of your progeny
everyone ive ever known is dead do you mind id like to be alone
no not at all


you asked to see me
look im about to go out of my mind for something to do i mean sitting here alone just dont get it what say you and i put together a little party
a celebration
no nothing that fancy just some folks some suds and some sounds hell it aint nothing but something to do
i will speak to the captain
great you do that
inquiry you do not seem to be having as much difficulty adjusting to your current circumstances as the others
you mean being here on this tub four hundred years from where i started heck its the same dance its just a different tune you think anybody heres got a guitar i could borrow
no but the computer can replicate such an instrument
i was kind of hoping to get one while i still remember the chords
commander data we are approaching the neutral zone report to the bridge
i must leave now
whats this neutral zone
it is a buffer between the romulan empire and the federation
why does that make me nervous
i do not know
we wont be inviting these romulans to our party will we
no that would not be appropriate
captains log supplemental we have arrived at the edge of the neutral zone where we will now have an opportunity to learn firsthand what happened to our distant outpost

captain there is nothing left of outpost delta zero five
must have been one hell of an explosion
sensors indicate no evidence of conventional attack
can you determine what happened
the outpost was not just destroyed its as though some great force just scooped it off the face of the planet
could it have been a natural phenomenon
insufficient information sir
mister la forge
sir
set course for the next closest station
aye sir

i have spent my career being able to tell when the other guys mouth is dry there is something going on here something serious the tension level on this ship has jumped up
even if youre right what can we do about it and besides these old boys here dont need us telling them where the bear sits look here what that young fella made for me

how did he do that
he called it a pattern replication it plays real good too
im trying to tell you that there is a situation developing on this vessel that directly affects us and all you can talk about is that stupid guitar
hey now these folks dont need us swimming in their soup so why dont you just relax and letem do their jobs
that may be all right for you but i am not willing to allow my fate to be decided by others i at least want to know what is going on

we are approaching tarod nine
the condition is identical captain
everyone and everything is gone
captain i strongly recommend that we go to red alert if the romulans have improved their cloaking device and wed be fools to believe they havent we should assume a more defensive posture
i agree captain i recommend we go immediately to battle stations
i appreciate your advice and concern but this is not the time for rash actions we are still investigating there are three other stations in this sector we have to visit lets proceed in a calm and orderly manner
if not battle stations may we at least take the ship to yellow alert
yes number one that would be prudent make it so



ah lets see i want to go to the er where would the captain be
captain picard is located on the main bridge
well then take me to the main bridge

captain my sensors indicate a disturbance it is large and moving but i cannot get a positive lock nor can i get it on the viewscreen
shields up
aye sir
captain i recommend we transfer all power to phasers and arm the photon torpedoes
wait if that is a romulan ship they will read our intent itll force them into taking a similar posture we dont want to engage in battle
captain this is sufficient evidence outposts have been destroyed countless lives have been lost
i have a positive lock theyre disengaging their cloaking device
theyll only be vulnerable for an instant as they become visible
captain this may be our only chance
no
where are they
the signal is weakening

ive lost them
damn mister data are your sensors picking up anything you should be detecting a disturbance
negative sir
we wanted to know if they have improved the cloaking device guess we have our answer
 they were trying to determine our intent they wanted to see if we would fire
who the hell are they
get that man off the bridge now
im not going anywhere
captain theyre back

amazing i never thought i would ever see a romulan ship not this close
the last time we encountered them was decades ago cost thousands of lives
i can believe that
stay calm everyone open hailing frequencies
captain these are romulans they are without honour they killed my parents in an attack on khitomer when they were supposed to be our allies they believe humans and klingons are a waste of skin
lieutenant control your emotions please open hailing frequencies
hailing frequencies open
romulan vessel this is captain jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise
sensors indicate all of their systems are armed sir
but theyve not fired lets try them again

i am commander tebok
commander you have crossed the neutral zone this is federation territory
it was necessary
it might be viewed as an act of aggression
if our intent were aggression you would not be here now
if we go to war let us be sure it is for the right reason we are here because our outposts which border the neutral zone were also attacked
destroyed in the exact same manner as your own
even so what gives them the right to enter federation space
silence your dog captain
lieutenant worfs question is valid
to even to ask such a question implies that we need permission we do not
do you think that we attacked your outposts
once we realised the level of destruction we knew it could not have been you
who is responsible
they havent got a clue theyre hoping you know but theyre too arrogant to ask
youre out of line mister
yes but its a correct assessment
we do not know who is responsible why entire outposts on both sides have been carried off
i would like to offer a proposal
an alliance between the romulans and the federation
nothing so grandiose just this cooperation there was an intent here whoever or whatever did this is more powerful than either of us lets collaborate lets share whatever we learn about what has happened here
agreed on this one issue and only if it is convenient and appropriate at the time
captain picard because your actions are those of a thoughtful man ill you this matters more urgent caused our absence now witness the result outposts destroyed expansion of the federation everywhere yes we have indeed been negligent captain but no more
commander we have made some progress here lets not ruin that with unnecessary posturing
your presence is not wanted do you understand my meaning captain we are back

i think our lives just became a lot more complicated get him off my bridge

ive found something i have been able to locate a family living outside of indianapolis the mans name is thomas raymond
thats my sons name my sons name is tommy
computer let us see thomas raymond
oh my god thats donald thats my husband
actually its your great great great great great grandson
hes the spitting image
well i have his address when you get back to earth you can go and see him
no ill be out of time a relic
perhaps but its a place to start after all he is family
theres no denying that

heres what i propose you cant stay on the enterprise but i have arranged for us to rendezvous with the uss charleston bound for earth they will deliver you there
then what will happen to us theres no trace of my money my office is gone what will i do how will i live
this is the twenty fourth century material needs no longer exist
then whats the challenge
the challenge mister offenhouse is to improve yourself to enrich yourself enjoy it
well one good thing is since everybodys forgotten everything i ever did itll all be brand spanking new ill be a bigger hit than i ever was
perhaps so anything is possible
what say you son youd make a hell of a sideman
that offer does present a certain fascination

captain i have plotted a course to intercept the charleston but theyve just informed me that theyll be making an extended stop at arloff nine
your point mister la forge
well at warp eight we could have our guests at starbase thirty nine sierra in five days take months off their journey
but theyll benefit from the extended time it will allow them to acclimate before returning to earth
its a pity we cant take them ourselves having them on board is like a visit from the past
that would take us in the wrong direction our mission is to go forward and its just begun set velocity warp six mister la forge
aye sir warp six
theres still much to do still so much to learn mister la forge engage
the child


repulse shuttle has cleared docking bay three
 open hailing frequencies
hailing frequencies opened
repulse this is the enterprise we are getting underway
acknowledged enterprise transfer complete good luck on your mission
and to you
give my regards to your captain repulse out
 shuttlebay is secure sir
thank you mister crusher make all preparations to get underway


were constructing the enclosure on cargo deck five

come
the transfers been complete doctor pulaski is being shown to her quarters were ready to get underway
 grand take a look at the containment module our chief engineer has designed
chief engineer it still has a nice ring to it
each of these units will have total environmental control gravity temperature atmosphere light all in a protective stasis field
and these get put into the large containment unit
right see these modules will keep the specimens alive but its this large containment area thats going to keep us alive now i have to go and replicate this five hundred and twelve times which means ill have to divert power from the warp engines to the replicator for a while
how long will we be on impulse power
a couple of hours cant be helped
when we leave audet nine im going to need all the power you can slam into those warp engines
youll have it
ill relieve you at zero three zero zero

take us out of orbit mister crusher set course for audet nine
aye sir course for audet nine has been input
maximum impulse velocity
aye sir
engage

engineering this is science one i have just observed what appeared to be a random energy transference

where
aft outboard of the port nacelle
hold on ill check

no i show nothing here data

problem commander
possibility sir an unexplained power fluctuation
let me know if it reoccurs
aye sir


captains log stardate  there has been an outbreak of an unclassified plasma plague in the rachelis system we are on an emergency run to collect specimens of the deadly plague and transport them to science station tango sierra where hopefully an antidote can be produced

hows it going
finished just waiting to insert the modules

number one
lieutenant la forge says we will be able to engage the warp drive within the hour
grand mister data when we have a complete list of all the specimens we will be carrying i want you and doctor er
pulaski sir
doctor pulaski i want you to go through them
aye sir
by the way where is our new doctor has she reported in
not yet
sickbay this is the captain
sickbay aye
is doctor pulaski there
er no sir the doctor is in ten forward
thank you
aye sir
a few hours on board and already shes found ten forward
ill go get her
no ill go
 not the best way to meet your new captain


deck ten forward station one
hello captain
ensign im sorry this mission will delay your reunion with your mother
thats all right that will give me the time to finish some projects i have to do its going to be hard leaving the enterprise
mixed feelings for all of us its always difficult leaving any ship just as it was for your mother

when she left to become head of starfleet medical but going from one assignment to another is part of the life which you are choosing
i know but this isnt any ship
how true


guinan
captain
where is doctor pulaski  thank you
picard goes over to a table by a window occupied by troi and another woman everyone say hi to
ann mulhall
 or
miranda jones
if you prefer
doctor katherine pulaski
ah you must be captain picard
doctor protocol may have been lax on your last assignment but here on the enterprise
sit down captain youd better listen to this

lieutenant la forge status report
the containment area is completed captain and the last of the modules are being inserted
take us to warp six as soon as possible
acknowledged
this is doctor katherine pulaski we will handle the formal introduction later counsellor deanna troi is pregnant she is going to have a baby
baby this is a surprise

more so for me
this pregnancy is unlike anything i have ever encountered since she came to me a few hours ago i have done two complete examinations of counsellor troi  this is from the first examination the foetus is about halfway through the first trimester about six weeks old now understand we believe conception took place eleven hours ago
what
it gets better this is the second exam one hour later now its consistent except for the fact that it appears the foetus is several weeks older at this growth rate counsellor troi will have her baby in about thirty six hours the normal gestation rate for a betazoid is ten months
i dont mean to be indelicate but whos the father
last night while i slept something which i can only describe as a presence entered my body
a life form of unknown origin and intent is breeding right now inside counsellor troi our purpose here is to determine what is to be done about this very unusual situation discussion
no wait let me get this straight deanna was impregnated by by what doctor what do the tests show is it a humanoid an alien
its a male human or in this case halfhuman halfbetazoid
exactly the same as deanna
in every way in fact there is nothing to indicate that there are any genetic patterns other than hers
i dont think this is a random occurrence i think theres a purpose here a reason what i dont know
captain obviously the pregnancy must be terminated for the safety of the ship and crew
worf you cant assume the intent was belligerent
that is the safest assumption
captain this is a life form not to allow it to develop naturally would deny us the opportunity to study it
if the foetus is aborted laboratory analysis is still possible
doctor is there any health risk to counsellor troi if the foetus is aborted
captain do whatever you feel is necessary to protect the ship and the crew but know this im going to have this baby
then it seems that the discussion is over
captains log supplemental we have finally arrived at audet nine where we will pick up the specimens of plasma plague for transport to rachelis it is only because so many lives are at stake that i am willing to put this ship and crew at such great risk meanwhile counsellor trois pregnancy continues to progress at an astonishing rate


how are you feeling
i should be feeling uncomfortable with all the changes in my body but i dont i feel fine better than fine wonderful

standard orbit sir
open hailing frequencies
hailing frequencies open
audet nine this is captain jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise
ah the enterprise here at last well good lets get going
excuse me to whom am i speaking
to whom are you speaking oh im lieutenant commander hester dealt medical trustee federation medical collection station
are the specimens ready for transfer
yes but with your permission i would like to inspect the containment area before we proceed now its not that i doubt the ability of your crew but we cannot afford a mistake
i appreciate your caution in the like vein i want a complete detailed manifest of everything you intend to bring on board my ship
very good i will allow access you to my computer banks okay

mister data download the inventory and crossreference it with the medical computer number one arrange to have hester dealt transported up
captains log supplemental although its been fourteen hours since we arrived at audet nine hester dealt has still not completed inspection of the containment unit a transfer will not be permitted until hes assured of zero growth during our voyage meanwhile the desperate pleas from the rachelis system continue

captain the final manifest has been received
at last review it with doctor pulaski i want you both to be completely familiar with it
aye sir

data will you help me get to sickbay

its time
oh you bet it is lets get you to maternity
worf assemble your security team in sickbay
is that necessary
yes doctor captains orders
well its strange to need armed guards in a delivery room this way

how frequent are your contractions
very close together
in my other deliveries except for a couple the father was always present
difficult under the circumstances
perhaps i could serve in that capacity
counsellor troi is going to need the comfort of a human touch not the cold hand of technology
doctor i think commander data will do very nicely
your choice

you dont have to do anything data just be with me
there is nothing to be nervous about
nervous i find this very interesting although i understand in technical terms how life is formed there is still a part of the process which eludes me the child inside you are you able to access his thought process does he have thoughts you are aware of him is he aware of you and when does that awareness begin
its happening
how does it feel
data
yes
now
now now doctor doctor doctor
this is an impatient baby hes eager to make his appearance do you want something for the pain it will in no way diminish the experience
i have felt no pain
none
no none at all

have your security men stand back i understand the importance of having you here but keep out from underfoot foetal position
normal
foetal pulse
one thirty seven
the baby is showing healthy respiratory movements

 the action of the heart rate is good the babys doing wonderfully troi breathe slowly youre doing great stay calm thats it there it is ive got him you can relax

 there there thats a good boy its okay oh my hes beautiful  are easy births the norm for betazoids
not according to my mother
 you can come in the rest of the way now theres no threat lieutenant you and your men can relax its just a baby

thank you for allowing me to participate it was remarkable
do you have a name
ian andrew after my father

were you hear all along
yes hes beautiful deanna just like his mother
how do you feel
fine wonderful thank you doctor for everything
amazing

captain
doctor welcome to the bridge please sit down how is counsellor troi did she have a good night
ive delivered dozens of babies but none like this there was no pain no trauma
its true
it was effortless for both of them
im not sure of your point
she had her baby yesterday if i were to examine her now i would not be able to tell she had a baby or had ever had a baby it was as if the incident never happened
data how long before we begin the transfer
two hours nineteen minutes sir
number one you have the bridge
aye sir
you will accompany me doctor please i think its time i paid my respects

come in
deanna i wanted to see how you were and have a look at your baby my goodness how old is he

in actuality a day
yes but
in appearance almost four earth years old
ian say hello to captain picard
you mean he can talk
hello

hello ian
please dont worry everything is okay
captains log supplemental we are faced with two major problems trois child and the deadly cargo we are about to take on in the hours since his birth trois baby has continued his rapid growth and now appears physically and mentally to be a child of eight still there is no indication as to who he is or why he is here

sickbay this is the bridge we are ready to begin loading
we need a little more time its taking longer than we anticipated to categorise these specimens

data look at this
data
what
my name it is pronounced data
oh
you called me data
whats the difference
one is my name the other is not
is this possible with all of your neural nets algorithms and heuristics is there some combination makes up a circuit for bruised feelings possible  i am unfamiliar with this symbol
it indicates a genetically engineered biological life form
about twenty percent of the specimens fall into that category some eager beaver at play
query eager beaver
well in this case eager beaver refers to some overachieving genetic engineer who probably because of lack of anything better to do has forced this strain of virus to mutate just so we can see how bad bad can get captain picard

picard
i just wanted you to know what risks were about to take
go on

if the most innocuous specimen on the manifest list gets loose

it will destroy all life on the enterprise in a matter of hours
i understand doctor do you have a recommendation

considering how desperately this is needed no i dont i just wanted you to know what we were carrying
thank you

commander data if you have completed your review you are needed in transporter room three

aye sir excuse me doctor
thats all right data data whatever


ian ian
hes a very tactile child he wants to touch and feel everything
its time to go sweetheart
unbelievable i think hes actually grown since you dropped him off
 i like it here mommy
i thought you would say thank you to miss gladstone for having you and lets go get something to eat
thank you
bye
thank you

biotransfer authorisation complete
cargo deck five we will commence transportation

on your command
transporter three we are ready to receive

data the first batch is in place and were ready for the next
youll inform me when loading is complete and the cargo secure
aye sir

come in
i wanted to stop by and see how ian was doing
were doing fine i was just about to get him his supper
do you want your supper now too
no ian but thank you for the invitation
youre welcome have you ever played with puppies
they had a litter today in the nursery
no ian i dont think ive played with puppies
you should come to the nursery while the puppies are still there
perhaps later

ow mom
let me see that  thats not so bad
my face is wet
is that better sweetheart everythings going to be fine
he allowed himself to be burned
for the experience
who is he why is he here what does he want
ian could you tell us why you are here
because mommy said it was time to eat
no i mean why you are here on this ship
i live here
ian i think the captain wants to know if you are ready to tell us why you came here
no not yet
the answer is within him when his cognitive powers have sufficiently developed he will be able to articulate it
i hope he will tell us soon
bye

cargo has been loaded and is secure
then take us out of orbit number one set a course for rachelis warp six


can i get you something
no nothing i just like to stand here
i dont blame you its beautiful
yes
how about some nice mareuvian tea
no nothing thank you
youll be leaving soon
yes
what do you see when you look out there
the lorenze cluster and there arneb and there epsilon indi
thats not what i mean i mean when you look there dont you see your future
itll still be there
how about a cup of nectar direct from prometheus
no nothing thats the third time youve asked me
its what im expected to do dont you always do whats expected
i try
even if its not what you really want
sometimes sometimes its more important to consider others before yourself
yes but sometimes the game is to know when to consider yourself before others give yourself permission to be selfish

somethings wrong
what is it
growth
where
l seven three
bridge this is cargo deck five

yes la forge
captain we have a malfunction in the containment area
how serious

very
captains log supplemental for reasons as yet unknown one of the deadly specimens of plasma plague has begun to grow

report mister la forge

captain weve checked everything theres no reason for this to be happening i cant even isolate the cause of the problem

come on data wed better get down there
doctor pulaski
yes captain
were having a little difficulty on cargo deck five your presence is requested
im on my way


you never talk about yourself
sure i do all the time
people say youre very old
oh
and that you knew captain picard when he was on the stargazer
no i never knew the captain till i came onboard
everyones very curious about you
yes ill bet they are
they want to know where youre from
where do they say
i heard that youre from nova kron and that
mister crusher report to the bridge
aye sir got to go thanks
for a dish of delovian souffl
no not for the souffl i meant for the rest
thats why im here
thanks bye

why this module and not the others
computer run diagnostic on module l seven three
 all circuits functional
environments as programmed temperature ninety seven degrees kelvin radiation flux zero stasis field nominal everything exactly as it should be right down the line
perhaps it is a sensor malfunction computer inquiry is growth actually occurring in module l seven three
confirmed

doctor one of the specimens is growing
destroy it now
i cant
data prepare to jettison the module
we cant do that either it will go into a spore and remain until it comes in contact with a planet or another ship the results would be disastrous
commander your attitude tells me that however bad i think it is its actually worse
this is not going to hold it
go on
the rate of growth is increasing so rapidly within thirty minutes its going to push out of its module within two hours itll break out of the containment area
no no no it cant break through this
yes it will
captain we may not be able to get control of this situation i recommend we arrange transfer of all nonessential personnel to the saucer section

if we lose containment we should be prepared to separate
make it so

why this one specimen and none of the others something is stimulating it do you have its etiology do you know how it was developed
yes its right over here
its a mutated strain developed by doctor susan nuress during an outbreak of plasma plague seventy years ago in the oby system it was number nine in a series of fifty eight tests this particular one bombarded by low levels of eichner radiation could exposure to eichner radiation stimulate growth
it could but i ive got something
why didnt you detect this before
i dont know it wasnt here before
well it is now what emits that type of radiation
a subspace phase inverter
we dont have one
certain cyanoacrylates
also not on this ship what else because its here and we better find it


i can feel that some of the people are very worried
yes i feel it too but dont you worry
its me mommy im the reason
what
its me
you
yes i have to leave you now or itll be very bad for everyone
what are you saying
i have to leave now
leave you are going to die no you cant sickbay this is counsellor troi i need the doctor in my quarters now ian ian no ian

its ian hurry
what happened did he eat anything did he fall
no
commander the child is the source of the unusual radiation
ian said hes the reason the ship is in danger
that analysis is correct
im losing life signs
you must save him
im sorry

commander riker the containment field has stabilised
thank you lieutenant
then ian was right he was the cause
apparently so
he is a life force entity when we passed each other in space he was curious about us so he decided the best way to learn was to go through the process to be born to live as one of us and in that way to understand us he never meant any harm
there was a moment when you smiled
he said thank you i told him we will miss him and i will


standard station orbit mister crusher
aye sir standard orbit
transporter room three this is the captain we have arrived

lets make this transfer with all deliberate speed
aye sir

ill be glad to be relieved of this cargo
you have the bridge number one
captain could i see you when you have a moment
in my ready room when your duties permit
thank you sir

how long is it going to take to develop a vaccine
we may never develop one
all of this might have been in vain
lets hope not
stand by to energise
good luck

data you can lock on to the first group and begin transporting on my mark

come

captain picard ive thought about this a lot i want to remain on the enterprise
have you discussed this with your mother
no sir before i do that id like your permission to stay
wesley its a little more complicated than that
captain this is where i want to be this is where i feel i belong
captain transfer complete we are ready to leave orbit
make it so number one return to your position

all stations secure
take us out of orbit mister crusher lay in a course for the morgana quadrant
yes sir
ensign crusher has requested to remain on the enterprise
im not surprised how did you respond
i havent as yet number one i didnt think it was my responsibility alone his remaining will create difficulties for us all
yes indeed with his mother gone who will see to his studies
exactly of course that duty will fall to commander data
and who will tuck him in at night
come on commander
i will accept that responsibility
well we know hell get his sleep
that takes care of the practical but theres more to growing up than that its my belief number one that youre best qualified to supervise that are you willing to serve
difficult decision yes i can do that
well mister crusher communicate with your mother at starfleet medical headquarters give her my regards and tell her you have my permission to remain on the enterprise but i will abide by her wishes
yes sir thank you sir i know shell agree

now if you have course and speed laid in
yes sir they are
then mister crusher engage
where silence has lease


youre worried
with reason
about worf or commander riker
both i think it is perhaps best to be ignorant of certain elements of klingon psyche


above look out

the exercise is over

at ease lieutenant

exit holodeck you do this every day
no commander usually my calisthenics are more intense but those sessions are too personal to be shared
ill bet they are
computer programme complete save coming commander
right behind you
captains log stardate  we are on a long reach toward the morgana quadrant a section of the galaxy which has yet to be visited by a manned federation vessel we are using the time to further detail the charts of this region

there it is again an area of blackness
it appears then disappears then reappears no predictable pattern no sequence
on screen
there it is
i cant see anything magnify section two eight five
there it is sir its like a hole in space
were acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon but this this appears quite different what do your sensors indicate
nothing sir
nothing
mister data you must mean its empty of matter theres always some energy form at work
sir our sensors are showing that to be an absence of everything it is a void without matter or energy of any kind
yet this hole has a form data it has height width
perhaps perhaps not sir
that is hardly a scientific observation commander
captain the most elementary and valuable statement in science the beginning of wisdom is i do not know i do not know what that is sir
captain if this were any ordinary kind of hole in space wouldnt we be able to see whats behind it
counsellor
i know what youre asking but i feel nothing from it
data is there any record anywhere of any occurrence even vaguely similar to this
accessing negative sir there is no record of any federation vessel encountering anything remotely like this
indeed i believe we have time to take a closer look number one
concur ensign slow down to half impulse power adjust coordinates to intercept this this whatever it is
scanning and recording as we go
aye sir adjusting course to intercept in twelve minutes sir

lets launch a probe into it
worf prepare a scanner probe lets see whats in there
this is close enough ensign hold this position
aye sir holding this position
you may fire the probe when ready mister worf

all the probes systems are functioning perfectly
its gone
data what happened
unknown sir
recommend we go to a yellow alert sir
why explain
sorry sir its
mister worf this starship operates best when my officers share with me what is their minds
my thoughts were of an old klingon legend of a gigantic black space creature which was said to devour entire vessels
devour vessels
sorry commander i agree these are thoughts hardly worthy of a trained and practical security officer
mister worf will you launch another probe this time a class one with full sensor array
launching sir

happened even more quickly
recommend we fire a photon torpedo captain
negative
captain based on where the probes disappeared i have been able to plot the outer boundaries i could move in closer
make it so mister crusher thrusters only mister data
still no readings of any kind sir
number one
im going with worf on this one lets be careful
all right thats enough ensign come to full stop and hold these coordinates
aye sir

whats happened
data
whatever it is sir we seem to be inside it
it enveloped us it moved all stations report
no response captain
captains log supplemental while exploring a strange void in space without any form of matter or energy we have apparently moved past its outer boundary and entered it after a brief disruption our ships communications have returned to normal

all stations have reported captain there appears to be no immediate threat to our ship or the crew
lets hold this position for a while number one this is worth studying
incredible its like looking into infinity sir remember the course in ancient history at starfleet academy about the time men still believed the earth was flat
and that the sun revolved around it
and that if a ship sailed too far out into the ocean it would fall off the edge of the world
beyond this place there be dragons its even said that crews threatened to hang their captain from the yard arm if he refused to turn back
im sure no one here has that in mind sir
how comforting number one
captain we have no communications outside of the void
complete your scans data lets not stay any longer than we have to

hello doctor have you been briefed on whats happened
i heard but i dont understand it captain
i wish i could say i did increase magnification by ten by one hundred
isnt this impossible sir im not a bridge officer but increase by one thousand mister data by ten thousand it does know how to do these things doesnt it
commander data knows precisely what he is doing
forgive me mister data im not accustomed to working with nonliving devices that forgive me again your service record says that you are alive i must accept that
engineering
engineering
lieutenant are all your systems functioning
yes captain wherever we are it seems to have no effect on engineering
thank you lieutenant data
difficult to make a judgment sir based on the absence of information
speculate
this void has a total lack of dimension therefore by any accepted standard it does not exist yet being within it denies that conclusion
might we have moved into another dimension
could a lack of dimension be another dimension in itself
thats an interesting question
for a later discussion number one i think we should get on with our mission starfleet can send a science vessel back to investigate further move us back out of here
aye sir wesley reverse our direction set a course for the cornelian star system impulse power
aye sir reversing direction course laid in
engage

your engines have engaged havent they ensign
aye sir

lieutenant la forge id like you to monitor our velocity closely
is everything all right up there captain
are the engines operating normally
yes sir everything looks fine down here
were increasing to warp two
aye sir

we should be seeing stars by now data how far have we come
inertial guidance shows one point four parsecs travelled captain
ensign
confirmed sir exactly what my readings say

engineering transfer to bridge whats happening sir we should be clear
we should be were on a reverse course
full stop helm
full stop sir
according to this were already well past the point at which we entered the void
except that we are still in it sir captain if we dropped a stationary beacon and travelled straight away from it we would have a fixed point of reference to confirm speed and distance
make it so data lock onto the beacon keep it dead astern
the beacon is in place captain

dead ahead impulse power
the beacon is falling astern captain
engineering report
all systems functioning normally sir
prepare to increase to warp two

aye sir
captain we are receiving a signal from dead ahead

maybe youve found the door out of this
closing on the new signal sir
identify
captain it is the stationary beacon we just released
we must have come full circle sir
we couldnt have sir ive shown us steadily moving away from that beacon
full stop hold this position again
captain sensors indicate a disturbance in sector one zero eight possibly a vessel
perhaps some answers at last on screen
the ship is equipped with a cloaking device
romulan
its closing
shields up go to red alert
ill be at my duty station
main viewer locked onto coordinates
arm the photon torpedoes mister worf
hold for my orders
there
its uncloaking

direct hit sir our shields are weakening
warn them well return fire
transmitting theyve armed another full spread sir
fire torpedoes

oh that was too easy
captain sensors can locate no debris from the romulan ship
impossible
captain theres another vessel approaching in sector zero nine one mark two six
on screen magnify
its a federation ship ncc one three zero five dash e its the yamato our sister ship
the yamatos nowhere near this quadrant
open a hailing frequency data
uss enterprise to uss yamato respond please uss enterprise calling uss yamato respond please on this frequency no response captain
make a full scan
life support system engineering and propulsion all appear functional but there are no life signs sir
data can we be getting a false reading
since we know nothing of these circumstances it is at least conceivable sir
you look doubtful sir
im not anything now number one im just a man whos looking for answers
like the rat said keep the cheese i just want out of the trap
captain request permission to board on the yamato with an away team perhaps something we can find on board in the logs will help us figure out what happened
granted minimum complement
worf youre with me
captains log supplemental we remain like a fly in amber trapped in the void we have encountered a vessel which appears to be the uss yamato all its systems are shown as functioning yet it seems devoid of life commander riker is leading an away team hopefully the answer lies over there

have you got a lock on that other ship
aye sir no problems at all
can you put us on the bridge
anywhere you say commander
i am acquainted with the yamato commander recommend the aft station of their bridge when in doubt surprise them
them whos them
whoever may be there
our sensors indicate no life forms
still the tactic is sound
agreed aft station lieutenant
aye sir
phasers on stun energise


this isnt the bridge worf

halt dont fire
i heard you screaming i was coming to help
you heard me i heard you transporter chief where do you show us over here
 we show as approximately
captain do you read me

 were having difficulties with our communications
number one come in transporter room this is the captain we are out of contact with the away team beam them back immediately

ive lost the lock on them

nothing on my communicator sir  computer on
lets find a turbolift to the bridge

transporter room have you been able to establish a lock

emergency power engaged
initiate full check all systems
engineering section report what is our situation  engineering captain request permission to leave the bridge
granted

this isnt a federation ship these walls arent tritanium its close but its material beyond our technology lets get to the bridge theres got to be an answer to all of this somewhere


this bridge should be four decks above us whats going on here

thats not where we came from
wait a minute
two bridges
if we go through there where will we be
on the bridge
but we are on the bridge
its up to you sir
lets see what happens

is it the same bridge
or did we step from one bridge onto another bridge


weve regained ships communication sir
 captain i have a star fix
on screen
its an opening sir
confirm sir navigation is possible
should i set a course
transporter room do you have a fix on the away team
negative captain
damn


sir

commander
how did you where did you come from
whats going on a ship has one bridge one bridge one riker one bridge

lieutenant
this is impossible impossible
pull yourself together worf 
 at ease lieutenant at ease
bridge
captain the star fix is fading
data lock on to the yamato with a tractor beam we leave together
i cannot make the lock sir
captain the star fix is almost gone
let it go
but sir we can get out
let it go
bridge

i have reestablished contact with the away team

beam them back immediately
captain


come in come in enterprise
hold position away team

ive got you were bringing you home

transporter room hurry
captain its almost gone

what the hell is going on
are you all right number one
ive had it lets put all this technology to work figure out whats going on and get the hell out of here

a ship that was almost the yamato existing in a hole in space with no crew aboard now what is the purpose
add to it an attack by a nonexistent romulan vessel it does suggest an interesting question was our away team actually over there
if we werent over there where the hell were we
commander i have reestablished the star fix
great set course velocity warp two
course and speed set
engage
i have lost contact sir
what
the star fix is gone
captain it is not in the same sector but another opening has appeared
all right set a course for those stars warp six
yes sir warp six
ive lost the signal sir
whats going on
all stop
captain
yes mister data i can see it
this game is now wearing very thin
lets just hold this position counsellor you have said you sensed no intelligence in all of this you havent changed in that belief
im not certain of that now captain i do sense something unusual
perhaps a different level of consciousness
yes perhaps an intelligence so vast it eluded me
rats in a maze
exactly
explain
everything weve been through reminds me of a laboratory experiment as if something was testing our responses to stimuli
are you suggesting that were in some kind of laboratory
yes
the opening seems closer captain
ive had enough of being led about this way
agreed captain hold present position
good dont satisfy its curiosity

captain look
why are you so alarmed when ive gone to such trouble to look just like you
captain sensors show nothing out there absolutely nothing
sure is a damned ugly nothing
i am captain jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise representing a federation of planets in this part of the galaxy can you identify whoever or whatever you are
nagilum
speaks right up for something your sensors say isnt there data
we still have no idea what you represent
data
nagilum
you are of different construction than the others interesting picard riker geordi haskell what are you your construction also differs

my construction
perhaps referring to your gender doctor
yes well there are minor differences im what we call a female
i understand the masculine and the feminine
it is the way in which we propagate our species
please demonstrate how this is accomplished
not likely
whatever you are your actions are not welcome
let me put up the shields sir
sensors still show nothing out there
your life form surprises me more and more is it true you also have only a limited existence answer
what information do you want i dont understand the question
you exist and then you cease to exist your minds call it death

how interesting
hes gone
we cannot allow you to do that we will fight you
to understand death i must amass information on every aspect of it every kind of dying the experiments shouldnt take more than a third of your crew maybe half
captains log stardate  it is obvious that whatever we have met sees no value in our kind of life form how do we fight something that both is and is not there

i know this much we are unimportant to it
in a battle for survival captain thirty to fifty percent casualties
would be appalling
but within acceptable limits
this is not a battle worf
no a laboratory experiment would be the closest comparison
is there any reason for not believing this nagilum
no
all evidence indicates it is willing and able to do what it proposes
agreed under the circumstances i think there is only one decision i will not stand by while half of my crew is slaughtered
sir i do not believe there is anything you can do to prevent it
yes there is
what
destroy the enterprise
isnt that a little like curing the disease by killing the patient
its better than standing around helplessly
why do get the feeling this was not the time to join this ship

recognise picard jeanluc recognise riker william t
initiate autodestruct sequence
does riker william t concur
i do initiate autodestruct sequence
desired time interval
stand by interesting question how long to prepare to die
what would be the least painful to our crew move to it quickly or allow them time to prepare for it thoroughly well twenty minutes nice round figure
initiate autodestruct interval twenty minutes
twenty minutes to autodestruct nineteen minutes fifty seconds


come

our destroying ourselves wont change its mind captain i would feel that
you didnt mention you were that certain
i was wrong not to tell you captain and your decision may also be wrong

yes come in please

i have a question sir
yes data what is it
what is death
oh is that all well data youre asking probably the most difficult of all questions some see it as a changing into an indestructible form forever unchanging they believe that the purpose of the entire universe is to then maintain that form in an earthlike garden which will give delight and pleasure through all eternity on the other hand there are those who hold to the idea of our blinking into nothingness with all our experiences hopes and dreams merely a delusion
which do you believe sir
considering the marvellous complexity of our universe its clockwork perfection its balances of this against that matter energy gravitation time dimension i believe that our existence must be more than either of these philosophies that what we are goes beyond euclidian and other practical measuring systems and that our existence is part of a reality beyond what we understand now as reality
we should not let ourselves die jeanluc
i agree with her jeanluc
if only half of us live then id rather take my chances on being one that does
yes it is wrong of you to force us
it is wrong
yes this is very wrong neither of you should be reacting in this way computer locate commander data for me
commander data is on the bridge
its not going to work nagilum

captain we are clear we are out of the void
its gone captain we can abort the autodestruct
hold number one
but captain
hold

one minute to autodestruct
we are out of the void sir you may stop autodestruct
mister crusher any heading warp six now
fifty seconds to autodestruct forty seconds to autodestruct
captain
it could all be part of the illusion commander data report
all navigational systems confirm we are at warp six on course sir
counsellor troi
captain it has gone i no longer feel its presence
twenty seconds to autodestruct ten seconds to autodestruct
captain
abort autodestruct sequence
riker william t do you concur
yes absolutely i do indeed concur wholeheartedly
autodestruct cancelled

a simple yes would have sufficed number one
i didnt want there to be any chance of a misunderstanding
of course you have the bridge
he sure held that bluff till the last second didnt he sir
was he bluffing

well nagilum i hope you got what you needed
you have provided me with much more than i needed
why did you release us you could have seen the way we face death
it wasnt necessary i have learned all i needed to know would you like me to share some of my conclusions
im not interested
of course you are you are too inquisitive not to want to know you seem to find no tranquillity in anything you struggle against the inevitable you thrive on conflict you are selfish yet you value loyalty you are rash quick to judge slow to change its amazing youve survived be that as it may as species we have no common ground you are too aggressive too hostile too militant
during this period you too have been evaluated it would seem that we have at least one thing in common
oh
curiosity
the point is well taken captain perhaps that is a trait we share
then perhaps well meet again but next time it will be out here among the stars

ensign put us back on course warp three
yes sir warp three
and ensign if you encounter any holes steer clear
elementary dear data

captains log stardate  we have arrived on station at coordinates three six two nine by five eight four three days early for our rendezvous with the uss victory there is nothing to do now but hold this position and wait

yes commander
is there a problem chief engineer la forge called for me urgent
oh of course hes over there with the victory
geordi i just had a strange conversation with your assistant although it is three days until we rendezvous with starship victory she
she believes it has already arrived not the starship my friend the original

this is my gift to the victorys captain zimbata
most unusual
i served with him an ensign sure wish hed been in command of this victory wind and sail thats the proper way to move a ship
but geordi your starfleet specialty is antimatter power dilithium regulators
thats exactly why this fascinates me data you see its human nature to love what we dont have simpler days huh anyway stringing this rigging has made me dream of handling sails
this is not a computer simulation
data the whole point in doing something like this is to make it by hand
geordi your message said urgent
so it is while were waiting to rendezvous with victory we have time for me to be watson more properly your watson

my watson
ive just shown you one of my dreams now lets go and share in one of yours
ah yes that does seem only fair
clancy ill be gone awhile see that no one touches this
aye sir and where can i reach you
he can be reached at b baker street
sir


computer select at random a mystery by sir arthur conan doyle where i will play sherlock holmes and lieutenant la forge will be doctor john watson
programme complete you may enter


excellent
look at all of the detail so you say everything here has some significance
holmes collected nothing neither trinkets nor thoughts which were not specifically significant to him
this
the emerald tie pin presented to holmes by queen victoria after he solved the theft of the brucepartington plans  a copy of whitakers almanac which provided holmes the key to the secret code in the valley of fear the snuff box of wilhelm gottsleig siegesmann van der romstein
all right data you solve the cases and get all the gifts what do i do
primarily as doctor watson you will keep a written record of everything i say and do for later publication and the famous holmes violin he purchased this in a pawn shop in tottenham court road for fifty five shillings which he considered to be a very good investment

in the hands of some the violin is a wondrous thing equally capable of stirring the soul to the heights of bliss as to the depths of despair but data thats incredible how can you play it like that
merely throwing myself into the part watson
but in the hands of my friend mister sherlock holmes the violin ceases to be a musical instrument at all and becomes
watson we are about to have guests
how could you possibly

be a good fellow and answer that lets not keep the inspector waiting
inspector who
lestrade of course
holmes are you there man

thank the almighty youre available today holmes im in a deuce of a dilemma
then may i say your perturbation becomes you inspector lestrade whilst simultaneously affording me yet again the opportunity to serve queen and country
data holmes really talked like that
absolutely
we need your help holmes you see this gentleman here the emissary of a foreign government has been the victim of a most accidentally wicked crime
 damn havent they invented the electric light by now
what dear fellow
watson pray continue inspector
to put the matter simply holmes this man was accosted by gypsies intent on depriving him of his most valuable possessions and in the process of picking his pockets clean they also happened to bag a photograph this man was carrying

great scott the photograph
i believe you will find inspector that this emissary here works not for but against the king of bohemia and that photograph of the king and his mistress is to be used as blackmail further upon deeper reflection you will deduce as did i that
computer freeze programme exit
geordi where are you going geordi
im done

 but but geordi i was just about to reveal that the sir is in fact a madam


data what was the point in going to the holodeck
to solve a sherlock holmes mystery
exactly but youve got them all memorised the first time someone opens their mouth youve got it solved so theres really no mystery if theres no mystery theres no game no game no fun im not upset with you data really its just that we go through all the trouble to arrange the time to go down to the holodeck to get the proper wardrobe to get into character and then boom before we even get started you jump to the end you see i was looking forward to the mystery
then i should have extended the sequence of events
oh im not getting through the fun in the programme data was in the attempt to solve a mystery
is that not exactly what we were doing
you are wasting your breath lieutenant saying that to data is asking a computer not to compute
am i so different from you doctor are you able to cease thinking on command
in medicine im often faced with puzzles that i do not know the answer to
shes right data you always know the answer
to feel the thrill of victory there has to be the possibility of failure wheres the victory winning a battle you cant possibly lose
are you suggesting that there is some value in losing
yes yes thats the great teacher we humans learn more often from a failure or a mistake than we do from an easy success but not you you learn by rote to you all is memorisation and recitation
i dont know about that deductive reasoning is one of datas strengths
yes and holmes too but holmes understood the human soul the dark flecks that drive us that turn the innocent into the evil that understanding is beyond data it comes from life experience which he doesnt have combined with human intuition for which he cannot be programmed
now youre just being unfair doctor
i dont think so lieutenant your artificial friend doesnt have a prayer of solving a holmes mystery that he hasnt read
i have read them all
you see laforge maybe the computer could create one in the holmes style one where you wouldnt know the outcome
as i said he wouldnt have a prayer
i accept your challenge doctor
good for you data
we will return to the holodeck where i will dare it to defeat me and you madam are invited to be a witness
i wouldnt miss it
come watson

there i have instructed the computer to give us a sherlock holmestype problem but not one written specifically by sir arthur conan doyle
so this will be something new something created by the computer
exactly will that be sufficient doctor
well see
programme complete you may enter


pies pies some are meat some are sweet
very impressive
your first visit to a holodeck doctor
well with this level of sophistication how does this work the real london was hundreds of square kilometres in size
this is no larger than the holodeck of course so the computer adjusts by placing images of more distant perspectives on the holodeck walls
but with the image so perfect youd have to touch the wall to know it was there and the computer fools you in other ways i say holmes where shall we head the theatre rules a concert perhaps

stop him stop him he stole my goods
no it is a ruse this way

whats over here data
what are you doing data tell us
the running youth was a ploy the real crime is here and the intended victim is that man mister jabez wilson employee of the red headed league dupe of a gang of criminals
i saw the plaque the home of the red headed league and this rope dangling from the bell which enabled me to deduce that mister jabez wilson was headed here to meet a most distasteful and untimely demise from this

fraud you didnt deduce anything all you did was recognise elements from two different holmes stories fraud
reasoning from the general to the specific is that not the very definition of deduction is that not the way sherlock holmes worked
variations on a theme now now do you see my point all that he knows is stored in his memory banks inspiration original thought all the true strength of holmes is not possible for our friend ill give you credit for your vast knowledge but your circuits would just short out if confronted by a truly original mystery its elementary dear data
now wait a minute doctor well see whose circuits short out

computer arch
are you sure you want to put yourself through this lieutenant better wilted laurels than no laurels at all
computer override previous programme okay a programme that definitely challenges data
now it has to deal with events that he has no previous knowledge of
computer in the holmesian style create a mystery to confound data with an opponent who has the ability to defeat him
define parameters of programme
what does that mean
computer wants to know how far to take the game
you mean its giving you a chance to limit your risk
no the parameters will be whatever is necessary in order to accomplish the directive create an adversary capable of defeating data

what was that
lieutenant
an odd surge of power sir its gone now


interesting the same london but slightly different
is something wrong professor
i i feel like a new man that dark fellow there used the word arch and then i wonder arch

what have we here
computer standing by
what are you
if you refer to the arch you ordered it provides computer control do you wish to input any commands
not at this time

its dark magic moriarty
the best kind im sure but i need information

data i mean holmes old boy what are we looking for
for whatever finds us my dear watson

she has been abducted
who has
the good doctor
i think shes hiding shes going to lead you on a wild goose chase and then recount the story to everyone between here and alpha centauri
watson the doctor has been carried off by two men one is tall the other is shorter left handed and is employed in a laboratory
and how do you know that
one set of footfalls are widely spaced the other is evenly spaced closer together further on the ground you can see the swirling scrapes made by his left shoe as he twists behind presumably to see if he is being followed left footed means left handed the dark colouring of the scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber a type of nonconductive soles used by researchers experimenting with electricity finally there can be no argument the game is afoot come watson

hear that what do those footfalls tell you watson
that were on the right track
more particularly that our opposition does indeed consist of two men and that one of them is carrying the bound and gagged doctor pulaski
now you know all this because you read it in a holmes story right
not at all because we do not hear the doctors footfalls we must assume that she is being carried and since we do not hear her cries for help we know that she is gagged further both sets of footfalls are heavy and masculine one man seems to shuffle and stumble in an irregular pattern since the ground is level we must conclude that doctor pulaski is struggling against one of her captor sporadically knocking him off stride deduction pure and simple well not that simple
footfalls

there they are again watson i dare say we have caught up rather nicely with our quarry

there should be a doorway
yeah come on

holmes thank god youre here


make way please make way make way for sherlock holmes its murder holmes murder most foul
well holmes what do you say man
there is nothing here of relevance i do not see how this connects with the disappearance of the doctor
doctor doctor watson is right here holmes
doctor kate pulaski but do not concern yourself inspector you have enough on your mind
she was with you
inspector perhaps i can be of assistance as i take note of this dead man i deduce that he was strangled you see the finger marks on his throat indicate the cause of death and as there are signs of struggle its quite obvious that his murderer was a stranger who attacked him from behind
is that correct holmes
no look at his shoes hes more a convict released today from dartmoor prison 
pentonville more like my dear holmes
 he spent the day in a tavern consuming large quantities of gin with his killer who followed him to this spot and waited over there until the victim slipped into a drunken stupor then out of fear motivated only by selfprotection strangled him there is your killer inspector

seize her
and when you check i believe you will find that this poor soul is the victims commonlaw wife who has been dreading the release of this a vile and abusive man
holmes the poor woman hardly has the strength to strangle a man this size
not with her hands no but with this  when used as a garrote these beads will leave marks quite similar to fingerprints and my dear watson you will note from the victims throat the marks are too evenly spaced to be have been made by human hands
astounding holmes
not really inspector and now for strictly personal reasons i must leave come watson this murder does not connect with our case
come along hurry it up come on

data wait if this murder isnt connected to the disappearance of doctor pulaski then the computer is running an independent programme
yes
why
i do not know and that is what puzzles me
then you dont know whats going to happen next
no
thats what i want to hear where to now
we will find doctor pulaski in here
how do you know that
it is the only obvious choice

why is the obvious choice all of a sudden the right one i mean isnt this a game of misdirection
not any more he wants us to find him
who does
the master criminal the man holmes could only defeat at the cost of his own life at reichenbach falls our adversary my dear watson is none other than professor moriarty himself
now this is getting interesting

theres nothing here but these barrels
and a trail which is so well marked that obviously we are meant to follow it
oh no data its another dead end
no watson not a dead end at all hello whats this can you see the scratches



the doctor was right finally we have a game worth playing
the time for games is over
professor moriarty i presume
how do you know that
he is the one worthy opponent created by the author conan doyle
and like the spider i feel the strings vibrate whenever anyone new chances into my web welcome my dear holmes but not holmes and doctor watson but not watson
data what does he mean how does he know were not who we appear to be
where is doctor pulaski
shes here
she would not have told you anything
she has provided many answers do you forget i have always been your equal dear holmes i have read her expressions what she has not said is as important as her words
have you injured her
i will if necessary but my mind is crowded with images thoughts i do not understand yet cannot purge they plague me you and your associate look and act so oddly yet though i have never met nor seen the like of either of you i am familiar with you both its very confusing i have felt new realities at the edge of my consciousness readying to break through surely holmes if thats who you truly are you of all people can appreciate what i mean
data
say nothing
i know there is a great power called computer wiser than the oracle at delphi a power which controls all of this and to which we can speak arch
data this isnt right a holographic image should not be able to call for the arch
it has described a great monstrous shape on which i am like a fly stuck on a turtles back adrift in a great emptiness what is this holmes

data data wait

data wait data
why does it frighten you holmes

data data will you please tell me whats going on
computer exit

computer execute complete shutdown of the holodeck
access denied
explain
override protocol has been initiated

its still running the programme didnt shut down
we must see the captain

data wait what is it whats on that paper and why cant we shut down the holodeck data
this
this is impossible how can a character from s london draw a picture of the enterprise whos got control of the computer
he does moriarty
that is impossible i dont understand
nor do i
data wait what about the doctor is she all right in there
no she is in grave danger

computer why wasnt the holodeck programme terminated
the override protocol has been initiated
on whose authority
lieutenant geordi la forge
me
all right tell me from the beginning exactly what happened
well doctor pulaski and i had a discussion about whether data could solve an original holmestype mystery
which you asked the computer to provide
yes with a worthy opponent
worthy of holmes

oh my god i asked for a holmestype mystery with an opponent capable of defeating data that got to be it
merde
captain im sorry
i understand lieutenant
captain this character moriarty he called for the arch
so he has access to the computer
and perhaps our library files as well sir that level of information would be necessary in order to create a true adversary for me
theorise data what are his limits
he is still a fictional character sir originally programmed with nineteenth century knowledge
which now has access to twenty fourth century knowledge
what does he need to begin making use of that
only time sir
sir i can lead a security team to sweep the holodeck find the doctor and bring her out
captain i believe that would place the doctor at risk it is probable our mortality failsafe has been overridden
computer where is doctor pulaski
doctor pulaski is on holodeck two
and her vital signs
strong and stable
captain recommend we try to destroy the hologram generations themselves is that possible geordi
using wave guides i could split a particle stream out of the matterantimatter chamber and route it down through existing conduit into the holodeck if accelerated to sufficient velocity that would quite literally wash away all present holographic constructs the london buildings the streets the people all gone including moriarty
doctor pulaski
the particle beam will tear apart human flesh as well
captain im sensing something from the holodeck its as if a unifying force or a single consciousness is trying to bring it all into focus
there can be only one explanation in programming moriarty to defeat me not holmes he had to be able to acquire something which i possess
exactly what
consciousness sir without it he could not defeat me

computer what happened
attitude and stabilisation control of the enterprise was momentarily transferred to holodeck two
data i think it best that you and i should return to the holodeck
i will change into my uniform sir
no i will change into some appropriate costume uniforms might pose questions id rather he didnt ask it seems that he feeds on knowledge well lets not give your nemesis any more information than we have to

how did you make the room shake
im not sure now dear lady will that be one lump or two

lumps professor what sort of lumps

milk of course
why not
mister computer proposes the incredible thought that we are all travelling in a great vessel of some sort is that true
i dont know what youre talking about
the scones are likewise a must
this is really quite excellent
strange it actually pleases me to hear you say that
very strange youre beginning to sound very different from the moriarty ive read about
youre not frightened of me
no
you should be mister computer the arch please a few more questions mister computer

i just cant seem to remember that last command ah well sooner or later itll all come to me but in the meantime i have decided to approach the problem from a more familiar perspective theres really no reason why i shouldnt be able to use some of the knowledge from my world in order to bring me closer to yours
i have no idea what youre talking about
of course you do madam the more you proclaim your ignorance the more you try to mislead me the more i am on to you your every silence speaks volumes
good then if you know what im saying when im not saying anything what do you need me for thank you for the tea and crumpets i guess ill be going
where back to here

yes would you care to join me
in time in time i will leave all of this and join you out there or is this where we both are right now
right now we are in london tell me what you want from me or allow me to leave
frankly now i want nothing more than what the fisherman expects of the worm you dear doctor will be the lure and this will be the hook for your captain jean luc picard
who is that
how well you know


nice suit
thank you captain i will be standing by to assist you if needed
youll be a big hit in london
 computer tell me is the programme still running
affirmative you may enter
data shall we go gentlemen open


we dont have much time hes getting more control of his environment lets see if we cant beat professor moriarty by giving him everything he wants

obviously hes trying to alter the programming here

captain
tuppence two pence supposed to be good luck we may need some
ill take that coin sir thats right and any more you got too
excuse me
i dont think so i want all that money thats right i want it now
data

captain this holographic image differs from any i have ever seen could he have actually injured you
its more serious than that i think the mortality failsafe may have been circumvented he couldve killed me
come on let it go guv hes hurting me
data let him go
we will find moriarty this way sir the warehouse

captain picard

you all right
yes except for being crammed full of crumpets
im a civilised abductor captain picard civilised but still dangerous


bridge to holodeck control worf

here sir
status anything changed
no sir

moriarty you were conjured up to attempt to defeat holmes here once that attempt is concluded win or lose your programme has run its course your existence is done
congratulations professor i capitulate to the better man your victory sir is well earned
its gone beyond that little game mister data and youll note i no longer call you holmes whatever i was when this began i have grown i am understanding more and more and i am able to use the power at my fingertips  i can affect this vessel and i can inflict bodily harm on you and on your doctor
yes you can do that but you havent i suspect you shook this ship in order to get my attention well now you have it what is it you want
the same thing you want for yourself to continue to exist if i destroy these surroundings this vessel can you say it doesnt matter to you interesting pun dont you agree for matter is what i am not the computer has taught me that i am made up only of energy
that may not be entirely true professor this which we call the holodeck uses a principle similar to another device called a transporter in the year in which we live humans have discovered that energy and matter are interchangeable in the holodeck energy is converted to matter thus you have substance but only here
and if i step off this holodeck
then professor you will cease to exist
you are not alive as i said before you are only
a holographic image i know but are you sure
oh yes
does he have life hes a machine but is that all he is
no he is more
exactly is the definition of life cogito ergo sum i think therefore i am
yes that is one possible definition
it is the most important one and for me the only one that matters you or someone asked your computer to programme a nefarious fictional character from nineteenth century london and that is how i arrived but i am no longer that creation i am no longer that evil character i have changed i am alive and i am aware of my own consciousness
moriarty my responsibility is this vessel and its crew
i want my existence i want it out there just as you have yours
that may not be possible
then you must murder me captain
i cannot give you what you want
because you do not know how to convert holodeck matter into a more permanent form
yes that is so
a pity what i have seen what i have learned fascinates me i do not want to die
and i do not want to kill you
madam i have enjoyed your company computer arch cancel override protocol return control of the holodeck to main computer my fate is in your hands as perhaps it always was
bridge this is the captain
commander riker here sir
number one the situation is under control
aye sir
moriarty this vessels computer has a vast memory capacity
how well i know
you will not be extinguished we will save this programme and hopefully in time when we know enough we will bring you back in a form which could leave the holodeck
then perhaps well meet again some day madam
it could be a long time time wont pass for you but i may be an old woman
but ill still fill you with crumpets madam i detest long goodbyes you have the arch
as you wish a short goodbye computer save the programme of the character moriarty and then discontinue



damaged
yes sir she cracked a spar when the enterprise was shaken otherwise i think she weathered it quite nicely
shes beautiful a wonderful testimony to simpler times
yes sir thank you sir its just that i cant help thinking how what else might have happened all because i misspoke a single word
well soon shell be shipshape and bristolfashion
bristol fashion sir
its an old navy phrase meaning everything in perfect order
yes sir
as are we mister la forge
yes sir
captain starship victory has arrived
on my way number one
the outrageous okona

captains log stardate  we are travelling in the omega sagitta system traversing between twin planets that form the coalition of madena both worlds is populated by a humanoid race which colonised the planets two centuries ago and which now coexist under a precarious but successful treaty

unidentified vessel approaching
sensor readings show it to be a small classnine vessel probably an interplanetary cargo ship
one life sign aboard sir it appears to be humanoid
i have its call sign now sir
confirmed armed with lasers only
its cargo holds are empty the readout shows its guidance system is malfunctioning the pilot is attempting to hold course manually
i recommend we set the enterprise on an intercept course in case he needs emergency assistance
make it so mister crusher

were in position now captain
open hailing frequencies
hailing frequencies open
on viewer this is the uss enterprise captain jean luc picard
 and this is the cargo carrier erstwhile captain okona at your service sir theres no need for your phasers captain im harmless and not quite yet ready for mercy killing
you were never considered a danger to us captain
oh thats a shame i can remember when i was at least considered a risk

im the owner and operator of this craft and since we both know that youve already scanned it you know im alone and empty which is truly a rare occasion for a man of my charm and talent
mute main viewer counsellor
his emotions suggest that hes mischievous irreverent and somewhat brazen the word that seems to best describe him is rogue
rogue ah cad knave rake rascal villain wild element
yes data but there is no malevolence or ill will
audio on you have a burnout in your guidance system captain
whoa since youre able to diagnose my problems how about helping me fix them
captain we could easily repair the type of system he uses
we can accommodate you captain
this is the first officer sir if you prepare to shut down your engines we can lock on the tractor and beam you over here
sir recommend limited access to our ship
agreed
data lock on the tractor beam transporter chief prepare to him beam aboard
ready on your command sir
excuse me commander is that a womans voice i hear
yes now please follow commander rikers instructions so our ship can get back to its normal routine
whatever you say captain
something funny
well the unexpected is our normal routine hold it steady wesley ready to link up on my command
aye sir
easy easy engage captain okona shut down your engines
understood
transporter room prepare for the beaming operation were on our way wesley data lets go


your weapons please
a klingon security officer
yes
no wars available eh

its more of a piece of jewellry than a weapon a remembrance
welcome aboard captain okona im commander riker if youll turn over the inoperative part to commander data we can begin repairs
id be most happy to do the work myself commander im sort of the handson type
i think youd find the tools we use rather unusual sir
i can believe that may i at least watch
that can be arranged
good then commander i leave this in your capable hands

sir this is commander data im just an acting ensign
well acting ensigns have names dont they
wesley wesley crusher
nice to meet you acting ensign wesley wesley crusher  and thank you for beaming me here and enabling me to see a truly beautiful woman you have the majestic carriage and loveliness that could surely be traced back to the noblest of families
well im sure that youve said that to many ladies before and it was no more true then than it is now
but its how i say it thats really important the warmth the attraction that i have for you the attraction that we share
mister okona seems to have excellent vision as well as a healthy libido
 its eight oh six
captain okona if you follow commander data you can get started right away

now thats sex appeal
sexual attraction in this context is not a part of my programming i am an android
well then have you seen any good looking computers lately thats a joke its funny
ah of course it is


will that do what the original did
sure will and better let me show you on your old one the zelebium contacts that wore down and then fused what ive done is replace them with tricellite
tricellite isnt available in this system if i ever had to replace it
dont worry you wont your ship will never outlast this part
because of the part or the way i fly my ship
well this part but the stress test did show that you tend to push your ship a little beyond its design capabilities
blame the pattern of my life lieutenant la forge because it relegates me to cargo carrying rather than the grand explorations you enjoy im forced to add a measure of flamboyancy and a zest to the doldrum of my existence

have you ever been cold
no
warm then
no
what about drunk ever do that
from alcohol that is not possible for me sir
pity what about love
the act or the emotion
theyre both the same
i believe that statement to be inaccurate sir
maybe life is like loading twice your cargo weight onto your spacecraft if its canaries and you can keep half of them flying all the time youre all right
i doubt that statement is entirely accurate either sir
accurate that was a joke i just told you
i do not understand
you dont know what a joke is
of course i do it is a witticism a gag a bon mot a fluctuation of words concluding with a trick ending
thats the dictionary meaning im talking about humour fun do you know what funny is  where is eight oh six
right over there sir why
you probably wouldnt understand that either

hello there

status on the repair
working on it
commander what do you think of captain okona
well okona is an interesting man certainly weve seen how he handles his ship apparently he knows how to handle people as well
then why does he work alone
hes a man who lives his life by his own rules he does what he does by choice by his choice someday youll make yours
i already have

so you agree with okona that i am missing a very important human factor
i never said that i simply said that ive never seen you laugh
i am capable of that function when it is expected of me
data do you even know what a joke is
of course i do it is a witticism a gag a bon mot a fluctuation of
stop look its just you and i here were talking were having an intimate conversation why because youre a droid and im a noid
but why
because thats what i am
have i said something to offend you
no
then why are you annoyed
because youre a droid and im a noid
humanoid
yes
you told a joke
yes
i am not laughing
yes
perhaps the joke was not funny
no the joke was funny its you data
are you sure
yes
i agree what do i do
well under normal circumstances id say seek a higher power but in your case probably a smarter computer is in order

mister comic i wish to know what is funny
funny i dont know its a matter of opinion i guess tip oneill in a dress some people say words that end with a k are funny a briefcase that looks like a fish personally i find that hysterical
tip oneill accessing twentieth century male politician overweight wearing female clothing carrying a valise that looks like a fish so the juxtaposition of gender and an amphibian briefcase is funny
well i think whatever makes you laugh is funny

nothing makes me laugh i wish to learn comic how much time do we have here

were going to need it you pal are a tough room
tough room a colloquialism meaning a severe rigid closedminded audience i understand i will attempt to be an easy room show me what is funny
all right youre on jerry lewis

 mister robot would you like to come up
i am an android
 oh im terribly sorry mister android here teeth put them in your mouth come up with me whered he go

try if you would you go ha

that is considered to be funny
actually it brought the house down in teaneck
ah a word that ends in k so if you put funny teeth in your mouth and jump around like an idiot that is considered funny
im sorry i didnt get your name
data
data did you consider juggling weird bird calls stuff like that
that does not apply i simply want to know what is funny i want to be able to involve myself in other peoples laughter i wish to join in
i think thats nice lets put the physical stuff aside for a while all right well do some jokes see its not my forte but i think that would work good for you if you would just have a seat and well try some jokes like i dunno well start with the classics see theres this travelling salesman now hes going down the road and his car breaks down right
access faster
comes up on this farmhouse and

its probably best when you do something like this need a cigar cos its kind a prop kind of thing and you go like this and data faster move to maximum speed


a guy walks into the doctors office the doctor tells him you need an operation the guy says i want a second opinion the doctor said okay youre ugly too baboom boom was that funny
no

data you spoiled the joke it could have been your timing
my timing is digital  what
thats funny
why
it would take too long to explain tell me another joke

still no response captain they are now locking lasers on us
lasers
yes sir
lasers cant even penetrate our navigation shields dont they know that
regulations so call for a yellow alert
a very old regulation well make it so number one and reduce speed drop main shields as well
may i ask why sir
in case we decide to surrender to them number one
still no response to our hail sir

sir we are now being hailed

federation vessel you have no rights in this solar system i am debin of planet atlec ordering you to heave to and prepare to be boarded
shades of gullivers travels he actually meant it
but he is right we are in their solar system open a channel
open sir
i am captain jean luc picard of the uss enterprise for what reason have you locked your weapons on us
enterprise you are towing a spacecraft of a known criminal
he was in need of emergency repair it was our obligation to assist
you have a man aboard by the name of okona i want him
on what authority
he is guilty of crimes committed on the planet atlec i expect him to be turned over to my authority immediately
mute
what do you think counsellor
he believes what hes saying his anger is genuine
open what crimes are you referring to
neither important nor necessary i want okona now
captain we have another class seven armed spacecraft approaching from the opposite sector
another ship from atlec
similar in specifications and capabilities but a variation in markings and hailing language

open sir

i am secretary kushell from the legation of unity of the planet straleb
i am captain picard
we know who you are captain picard we have been monitoring your communications and we know of the demands made by debin of planet atlec
then youre aware that we have no hostile interaction
you only have to concede to one demand
that word demand has a tone of finality
it is a word i have chosen we demand you turn okona over to us immediately
mute
mister okona to the bridge immediately open the same demand has been made by the atlec legation
i have no interest in their request but we intend to back up our legal right to okona
i would rather not escalate this situation any further
our honour and prestige are at stake we are prepared to take okona by force and die in the doing of it if necessary
i trust that that can be avoided i will respond to your request shortly viewer off
captain okona has not responded sir hes been reported in three different crew quarters
find him get him up here
yes sir


you will come with me to the main bridge
im sure it can wait a few minutes
now

id like that but i have my orders
some other time  remember what it took to drag me from your arms

am i going to meet captain picard
definitely
did i say something funny

captain picard this is thadium okona
mister okona you were welcomed aboard without any undue investigation in turn it was assumed that you did not come under false pretenses it now seems that you may have done
captain if you mean my socialising with the members of the crew
mister okona you are free to socialise with the members of my crew im talking about a man named debin
hes from atlec ive had dealings with some of his family
then perhaps you can explain why his craft is threatening to attack us unless i give him custody of you
i cant
then tell me why kushell of the planet straleb is demanding the same thing
hes here also
and quite adamant mister okona what crimes are you accused of
i am not a criminal
why do these men want you
i cant say
theyre threatening to attack the enterprise
that would be crazy they wouldnt stand a chance
right then you can offer no reason why they are set on this provocative course
i cant think of one right now
on viewer
which ship
what the first on captain debin captain let me ask you again what are okonas crimes
that is not your concern
it is if you wish me to release him to you
all right you want to know what he did you want to know why i have chased him across this system all right here this is his crime

he dishonoured my daughter he took advantage of her then he ran off and left her carrying his bastard child hell return and hell do the right thing or ill hunt him to the ends of the galaxy
captains log supplemental some of the mystery surrounding this ancient morality play weve been dragged into has been revealed one of captain okonas pursuers is an outraged father with a heartfelt if arcane sense of righteousness

your advice counsellor
we are dealing with ancient codes involving procreation while they may be meaningless to us to debin they represent his honour he will fight risking himself his crew his daughter and her unborn child
you know captain your counsellors right he will fight
the captain of the other ship is demanding to be heard
i dont suppose you can give me any indication why this man wants you

lets put all this together lieutenant worf multiple image full conference mode let them all see each other
yes sir
here you are debin trying to save this criminal
my purpose is not your concern
it is if it involves okona
gentlemen please lets try and resolve this matter captain kushell what crime has okona allegedly committed against you
he is a thief he stole the jewel of thesia a national heritage
a thing an item my case involves the victimisation of my daughter and my honour ill have okona now
he is mine
one at a time who accuses me of stealing
i do my son benzan and i
father please
he used you to become my friend
he used my daughter
he used my son to plunder a national treasure
mute
terminate communications come with me

captain you cant be afraid of those two or what they can do to your ship
no they could fire until their lasers ran dry and they wouldnt hurt the enterprise my predicament is what to do with you okona im sorry im sorry my ship broke down im sorry you stopped to help im sorry youre involved but youre right whatever happens however it goes someone gets hurt hand me over to kushell and debin goes to war
and if i hand you over to debin then its the same thing
i wish i could i wish i could make it easier
im sure you do
im not going to apologise for the way i am or how i live my life but just for the record i did not steal the jewel of thesia i am not a criminal captain and as to the other business thats between me and yanar no one else
in truth i simply do not have authority in this matter im not your judge nor is it my duty to arbitrate but you are in my custody and that creates the dilemma
how about this do what you said fix my guidance system and let me leave
according to starfleet regulations that would be my only course of action but their ships are faster than yours im not doing you a favour
captain with all due respect thats not your concern besides i can take care of myself

youre quite a craftsman lieutenant la forge how soon
whats the rush i thought you liked it here
i did it stopped liking me time to disappear
where will you go
what
i said where will you go
a new place if i make it
dont you ever stay anywhere
not for long
i couldnt be like that
oh
i mean always being alone commander riker says you choose to live the way you do and you like it
is that what he says
yeah it would be difficult for me to be leaving all the time id miss my friends the people i love i guess leavings gotten easy for you
i seem to have a way of using up a place
i wasnt talking about a place
i know i know what you were talking about
its ready you should be able to install this in roughly five minutes
like you said geordi whats the rush i have some friends around here i think its time to make a stand

mister okona
captain ive decided not to leave
oh
dont worry im not staying either
just what are your plans mister okona
ive decided to surrender myself
to which one
theres really only one option
viewer on gentlemen communicating like this is very distracting i suggest that we beam you up to the enterprise and we resolve this face to face
excellent
agreed
leave your weapons behind lets keep this civilised
number one you have the bridge counsellor troi would you accompany me to deck fourteen conference room worf see to our guests
aye sir


they have no weapons
this way


okona you are without shame
for once i agree with debin you are without shame i trusted you my son treated you like a brother and then to steal from us i want him now
no hes coming with me captain my complaint was registered first
now please please be calm lieutenant thank you

everyone is talking about me and no ones talking to me you all believe that i stole the jewel and that it was i who fathered the child
you dare call my daughter a liar
and now im offered these two choices and given these two options condemnation as a thief or marriage to the beautiful yanar i will take the more pleasant sentence i will take yanar as my wife
no you cant
my son is right you cant escape that way
thats not what i mean
its not up to you or to okona ive been dishonoured i will decide
wait since all of you believe okona is the father of this child then so be it ill marry you
no you cant
yes i can
okona is still a thief
no hes not nothing has been stolen the jewel of thesia has been taken into custody by its rightful heir me i was to give it to yanar as our pledge of marriage
marriage
yanar is carrying my child
you said it was okonas
if id told you it was benzan you would have gone to war with his father so i let you believe it was okona
see how a man gets a reputation
if i had told you i was giving the jewel to debins daughter youd have disowned me
now were hearing some truth
so you let me chase okona when you knew he was innocent
yes because i didnt believe for one moment that you could catch him
well said he never would have
and once yanar accepted the jewel the marriage would have been made
well i never got it
then okona does have the jewel
i never had the chance to deliver it
anyway its too late i wont marry benzan
then youll marry okona
i wont marry anyone

i have reinstated the same programme
along with some new jokes i hope
programme complete enter when ready

comic continue
more freebies huh no cover no minimum just comic continue tell me data what happened
i told a joke
and
no one laughed
no one nobody in the whole room
i was the whole room
she said i spoiled the joke
actually killed would have been a better word
you know data i think i know what your problem is you should always try out new material on an audience
you know he could be right perhaps an audience is what you need
computer programme an audience appropriate to this venue


yanar youre angry at the embarrassment of all this and maybe the timing and the approach is not the most romantic but i know you love benzan and i dont want to see you throw away that feeling just because your parents have been quarrelling for years and dont know how to behave properly ive carried your messages back and forth for almost six months ive smuggled each of you into the others homeland you feel for him the same way he feels for you

i do love you it is your child our child
marry me
yes

well find a new planet to live on
youll live on straleb
no no no no no youll live on atlec
i will not have this man raising my grandson
the rest of this is an issue gentlemen to be settled between yourselves now if you will excuse us we have business
thank you captain
your grandson
my grandson


thank you thank you thanks for coming folks we got a great show for you tonight im so excited this evening tonight i have for you the funny man of the stars the android of antics that lieutenant commander of mirth please give him a nice welcome ladies and gentlemen none other than hes just the best data

good evening ladies and germs  i come from a town so small we had a fraction for a zip code 
you made a living doing this
yes i did
it was so small in fact we didnt have a godfather of crime we had a nephew 
 i was so ugly as a child they hung a pork chop around my neck  so the dog would play with me  and then there was the human cannonball who was hired and fired in the same night audience programme off discontinue comic

it was a holodeck audience they were programmed to laugh at everything perhaps i should reprogram the audience to display a more accurate response
data let me give you one being able to make people laugh or being able to laugh is not the end all and be all of being human
no but there is nothing more uniquely human

hold your speed captain okona disengage
separated
im under my own power now thank you enterprise thank you captain picard
goodbye captain okona
bye captain okona say goodbye data
goodbye data

was that funny accessing ah burns and allen roxy theater new york city  it still works then there was the one about the girl in the nudist colony that nothing looked good on
were ready to get underway sir
take my worf please
warp speed sir
please
the schizoid man

medical log stardate  ira graves is arguably the greatest human mind in the universe for years hes lived in near isolation on a remote planet devoting full time to his research eight hours ago we monitored a message from his assistant urgently requesting medical aid i only hope we can reach him in time

any response from gravesworld mister worf
nothing sir not since their initial communication
they send out a plea for help then they cut off transmission so they cant tell if theres any help on the way doesnt make much sense does it
ensign whats our eta at the planet
thirty six minutes to orbit sir
starfleet command considers graves work on molecular cybernetics is reaching a critical stage they consider this a priority one action
a man is ill captain treating him is my priority one regardless of who he is

did data say why he wants to see us
he said something about his new image i tell you hes been acting kind of strange lately
how so
well if i didnt know better id say he was showing signs of insecurity
yes but you do know better androids dont feel such things
i dont know sometimes i think hes becoming more human than any of us realise

come in

data
geordi is counsellor troi with you
yes im here data geordi said you wanted to see us
indeed or stated more correctly i wanted you to see me
can we come in
please

did you damage your face data
it is a beard geordi a fine full dignified beard one which commands respect and projects thoughtfulness and dignity well opinions
its er very different
when i stroke the beard thusly do i not appear more intellectual
im sorry i have to go now goodbye

why was she laughing

we are receiving a transmission from gravesworld sir its unfocused not directed specifically at us
on viewer mister worf
 if anyone can hear me please send a doctor things are getting worse

try and raise her mister crusher tell them were only minutes away
its no good sir i dont believe theyre receiving us
our records show that she and graves are the only ones living on the planet captain
then what scared her
captain i am picking up another signal but it is not from the planet
on screen mister worf
the signal is very weak sir audio only
pipe it through
mayday mayday this is the uss  questing emergency assistance  the outer hull is breached and environmental systems compromised need assistance
captain i show the constantinople in that general vicinity shes a transport ship used to ferry settlers im showing two thousand and twelve colonists aboard
outer hull breach she must have had an internal explosion
if thats the case theyll all be prone to severe hypoxia their lives are at risk weve got to help them
and what about graves
hes one man
suggestion captain why dont we execute a long range transport of an away team to assist doctor graves at earliest possible moment wed come out of warp just long enough to energise the beam
a touch and go down warping mister crusher prepare to make it so
aye sir
engineering mister la forge were going to execute a near warp

transport this may be a little tricky i would like you to handle it
yes captain

im on my way
assemble an away team number one include whoever the doctor requires to assist
excuse me sir but there may be hundreds on the constantinople that require emergency attention i should be there to supervise
all right who will replace you
lieutenant selar she has my complete confidence
worf lets go


phaser on stun mister worf we dont know whats going on down there theres no need to take any chances
agreed sir
now remember this is a near warp transport so the effects may be a little unusual
what do you mean
youll see counsellor energise
now wait a minute i dont understand

you do now
this might sound crazy but for a moment i thought i was stuck in that wall
for a moment you were
data to enterprise
i read you commander go ahead
we are inside graves home

all is quiet so far of course no one knew we were coming
use caution but protect graves health

at all costs
understood sir i suggest we look around to see if anybody is home
no need commander
you heard me thank god im kareen brianon doctor graves assistant
were from a ship called the enterprise we monitored your distress call but then you never acknowledged our response
im sorry i couldnt take the chance
chance what chance

the chance that i might find out someone was coming kareen knew full well that i would not be pleased to put it mildly
i had no choice i refuse to stand by and watch you deteriorate
 what symptoms have you noticed
he has pain shortness of breath irritability
ridiculous im as healthy as a rigelian ox
hes not himself believe me his temper is completely out of control
nonsense
ira
i am a doctor lieutenant selar
no offense but i dont want you touching me in any way its no secret that i dont like people much and i like doctors even less
thats funny i thought most doctors were people
then youre wrong ask any patient although i will admit for a doctor youre not a bad looking woman well well well what have we got here another lovely specimen of womanhood
i thought you didnt like people
women arent people theyre women 
im deanna troi its an honour to meet you doctor graves
yes of course it is this is one of the truly great moments of your life
excuse me sir are you a romulan
hardly
hes a klingon kareen kareen has lived here since her father died when she was very young her only knowledge of unhuman races comes from me klingons and romulans dont look much alike kareen even though they act much alike
must i stand here and be insulted
no insult intended mister klingon you see doctor theres nothing wrong with my hearing my my my my
lieutenant commander data
shhh absolutely no aesthetic value whatsoever looks like soongs work

quite correct sir did you know doctor soong
know him i taught him everything he knows you could say that i was the father of his work which kind of makes me your grandfather doesnt it sonny damn doctors always sneaking up on one attacking from the rear go on gorgeous spit it out whatever the hell it is i can take it
ive checked twice to make certain you have darnays disease im sorry doctor graves its in its final stage
cant you do something for him
in all cases darnays is terminal
captains log stardate  weve successfully repaired the stricken liner constantinople forty six of her people suffered injuries mostly minor they have been treated and supplied with the proper medicines our task complete we are heading back to gravesworld with great dispatch


i have noticed doctor
call me grandpa seems more touching in my final hours
i have noticed grandpa that you keep repeating the same notes of a musical phrase i am unfamiliar with
its an ancient little tune called if i only had a heart a plaintive lament sung by a mechanical man who longs to be human its his only wish
what happens to this man
he finds out hes human after all always was just worried so much he never realised it
a happy ending the mechanical man gets his wish
stories often have happy endings its life that throws you for a loop it must be so hard for you to be so close to being human and yet never really knowing what its like to know pain
but pain is unpleasant is it not
pain lust envy pleasure desire do you know what desire is data
desire to long for to crave a wish a request a
do you know what desire is
no i do not suppose i will ever really know
i feel pity for you your existence must be a kind of walking purgatory neither dead nor alive never really feeling anything just existing just existing listen to me a dying man takes the time to mourn a man who will never know death funny isnt it
funny i have had great difficulty determining what funny is
ive had the same difficulty most of my life were much alike

id say he has a week but thats only an estimate we do know that the disease attacks the brain and nervous system we can expect more of the erratic behaviour of the kind youve been noticing
his feelings towards you are very warm hes attracted to you in many ways
attracted i know ive felt certain feelings from him and for him had i been older perhaps we couldve been thats not the way it worked out and now its like hes afraid to face me the only one he talks to is your friend data

you mentioned your impending death grandpa may i say you face it with remarkable courage and stoicism
that is because i am an incredible man possessing an iron will and nerves of steel two traits that helped me become the genius i am today as well as the lady killer i was in days gone by
you condone homicide sir
its an expression data it means i was once as beautiful as i am smart
really grandpa
no not really but what the hell im dying i can remember my life any way i want and ill let you into a little secret sonny i dont really believe i will be dying
but the doctor
oh ill die but i wont really be dead you see i believe ive learned to transfer the wealth of my knowledge into a computer before i die i plan to transfer my great intelligence into this machine thus cheating the grim reaper of his greatest prize but what would you know of death it is a subject forever alien to you
that is not necessarily true grandpa i do have an off button if you will its activation robs me of my consciousness therefore rendering me dead for all intents and purposes it is not something i enjoy contemplating
i can understand that just where would soong position such a device dont tell me let me guess

captain to away team were standing by
i do not wish to interrupt data and the doctor they seem to have developed a genuine rapport but the enterprise has reached its orbit and id like to transport graves to the ship as soon as possible

that will not be necessary doctor he is gone
gone
it happened just a few moments ago in my arms ira graves is dead
captains log supplemental i leave gravesworld with an empty feeling and the knowledge that our mission was unsuccessful whatever scientific secrets ira graves was about to unlock have been lost forever our immediate priority is to reach the nearest starbase so that graves assistant can get on with her life

why didnt you contact doctor selar when you saw that he was beginning to go
to do so would have been pointless all things must pass may i go now sir
yes of course
we will try to honour him in the manner in which he specified will we not sir
i said we would data
i am glad sir it was his dying wish


hello data its good to see you again the stars are so beautiful from space yet they seem
you always did love the sky a stargazer that is what you are
did ira tell you that i guess hes right i used to spend hours just lying on a hill looking up
ira never told you how beautiful you were to him he never told you that did he he could not tell you do you understand
yes i understand
he wanted to every waking moment and he wanted you to know that you were everything to him


graves body is in a torpedo case wearing a shroud
he was a fine man a man of rare gifts and great accomplishments he will be sorely missed does anyone else have anything to say

i believe i have a few words to say sir  just look at that face the face of a thinker a warrior a man for all seasons yes ira graves was all that and more but he was not perfect perhaps his greatest fault was that he was too selfless he cared too much for his fellow man with nary a thought for himself a man of limitless accomplishments and unbridled modesty i can safely say that to know him was to love him and to love him was to know him those who knew him loved him while those who did not know him loved him from afar
data
im almost finished sir
you are finished data

we now commit the body of ira graves to the timeless depths of space

i am sorry sir perhaps it was my admiration for grandpa that got the best of me
grandpa
that is the way i think of him sir my only living relative no longer living
data
i was only trying to carry out his wishes i just wanted to keep my promise to him
i know that data look i realise youve been studying the human equation with great alacrity but perhaps youve been working at it too much dont try so hard to be human just be yourself all right
yes sir i will work on staying within myself
grand youre dismissed mister data
thank you sir

captains personal log although commander data has assured me that his odd behaviour will return to normal i cant help thinking that something went wrong during his visit to gravesworld

im still concerned captain ive never seen him act like this
could it be that grandfather analogy that graves planted in his head data is an orphan in a manner of speaking is it possible that the loss of graves might have affected him touched him on some emotional level we didnt know he possessed
i hope youre right i hope thats all it is

that was a great speech data to know know him is to love him is to know him
verbal composition at its most sophisticated level your childlike mind cannot appreciate the timeworn wisdom of my words
childlike mind
when you get to be my age you will understand
your age data chronologically youre not much older than i am
you are only as old as you feel try to remember that boy
youre not turning into a philosopher are you mister data
i am many things scholar artist philosopher lover genius
data whats wrong with you

 how beautiful
i thought you might enjoy the bridge miss brianon im aware of your interest in science perhaps youd like to see the computer terminal
yes im aware of your interest in her
what was that commander
nothing sir nothing at all
these are the science stations from the command centre here we have control of the science stations 
data what are you doing
i detest hypocrisy i wish they would just come out and admit it
admit what mister data
that your interest in kareen is not purely professional try as you will you cannot win her heart she does not care for older men or men of limited intellect 
mister data you will come with me right now do you understand me
i understand i understand all too well removing the competition will not help you picard

excuse me

do you know what that was all about
jealousy intense burning jealousy a human emotion and it was coming from data


if you wish to apologise i am prepared to listen
you expect me to apologise to you
you were a bit rude to me might make you feel better if you said you were sorry
data something has obviously gone wrong with your circuitry
that is ridiculous i am as healthy as a rigelian ox
i wish i could believe that i would accompany you to to sickbay but i doubt if that would do us any good
sickbay are you ill captain
im getting there im going to have engineering run a full physical on you
i am sure that will not be necessary captain i am fully capable of running a circuit check on myself it will immediately determine any abnormalities
do it thats an order
just as i expected i am fine could not be better
for the first time since ive known you i dont believe you


try and hold still will you data
data will you wait for me in the corridor
why should i this concerns me more than it does any of you
you will wait for me in the corridor  his insubordination is growing by leaps and bounds i could use discipline but id rather try and help him
i wish i knew what to suggest im damned if i can find a thing wrong with him
perhaps were looking in the wrong place
meaning
well if datas physical health is unimpaired perhaps his mental health needs to be addressed
what are you saying that data is losing his mind
with your permission captain there is one way to find out

now data you remember the psychotronic stability examination we all had to take it before graduating from the academy
it was a waste of time then and it is a waste of time now
it will just gauge your psychological reactions to the images it projects watch the screen and let your mind go blank the device will do the rest


its safe to say that youre his best friend is it possible to speculate about whats happening to him
well sir its just a guess but sometimes he wants to be human so badly he can taste it i think he just tends to get confused when his human qualities surface
go on
witnessing graves death may have been some sort of catalyst for the way he

i have the results of the tests i ran them several times to be sure
to be sure of what
there are two disparate personalities within lieutenant commander data each distinctly different a dominant and a recessive
but hes an android is that possible
it must be the dominant personality is unstable brilliant but vain sensitive yet paranoid and i believe it is prone to irrationality
of course
sir
nothing go on
it seems to have an especially strong hatred of you captain or to a lesser degree any authority figure and worst part is its growing
how do you mean
the alien persona is getting stronger and gobbling up what is left of the weaker ego the data we know if something isnt done to stop it immediately we will lose our data forever
captains personal log we have arrived at starbase six where miss brianon will await transport back to earth i am greatly troubled by the unusual behaviour of commander data and fear that somehow it is directly related to the experiments of ira graves

where is data now
he should be in his quarters you ordered him not to leave

tell me where is lieutenant commander data
current location ten forward
lieutenant worf will you go to ten forward and keep an eye on data dont interfere with his actions unless you hear otherwise from me
worf here sir acknowledged
i want to know more about what happened down on gravesworld lieutenant selar report to the captains ready room

hello kareen dont you think its time we stopped pretending you know who i am
youre data
you do know who i am
ira
it is me i am here i am alive
how

i deactivated data and transferred my mind into his frame i never imagined how much of my self i would retain my feelings my dreams
they wont let you get away with it theyll try to stop you
how can they it is my body now it is out of their hands

doctor tell me how much time did data and graves spend together
they were together practically the entire time we were on the planet
always alone
yes always
doctor what was your impression of graves
he seemed brilliant egocentric arrogant chauvinistic
sound familiar

something wonderful has happened i can take a deep breath now without feeling stabbing pain i will never have to face death again think of the things i will accomplish over the next thousand years what oh i know what youre thinking there is no need to worry i will create an android body for you too we can witness the end of time together why are you crying kareen i can love you now the way i always wanted to it was not right before i was too old for you too weak now i can be everything you want me to be
i wont let you put me in a machine i want to live my life i wont let you take it away from me ira ira youre hurting me

worf to captain picard

commander data has left ten forward should i follow
negative ill handle this myself he was an expert in cybernetics
yes
our memorial service may have been premature what an achievement so long as men can breathe or eyes can see so long lives this and this gives life to thee

he was working on bridging the gap between man and machine
it seems he built that bridge i may be forced to tear it down
en
loud as a whisper

captains log stardate  the enterprise has been diverted to the ramatis star system it seems that both sides of a bitter planetary conflict have petitioned starfleet to transport to their world a mediator they have mutually selected our orders are transportation only no interference

reduce to half impulse
reducing velocity to one half impulse


come ah number one look at this ever since we left the lima sierra system i have been puzzling over how the third planet could maintain such an orbit when it is theoretically impossible but consider this
theres no degeneration
exactly
why
why i havent a clue
perhaps this facsimile lacks the proper mass
perhaps but if this is an accurate representation it could explain what happened in that system
perhaps
well not a matter of great moment just a knot i had to untie so what do you want to see me about
weve arrived at ramatis three
oh well time to leave

standard orbit mister crusher
standard orbit
mister data you have the bridge

transporter room five im still a little uncomfortable with your leading this away team
this is not an away team commander i consider this a ceremonial function for me not to go could be construed as lack of interest
you will be careful sir
oh cluck cluck number one
sir
youre being a mother hen i appreciate your concern actually im looking forward to meeting this mediator
we came a long way to get him
they wanted the best that according to all reports is riva

if he can put an end to all the years of bloodletting on those planets i think we should do everything in our power to assist him
our job is not to police the galaxy
isnt that my speech number one no of course youre right we must not get involved


coordinates have been input sir
have your sensors indicated any problem down there lieutenant
none
but youre feeling a certain confusion about this mission
no
yes ive never known you to have such strong emotions except when youre expecting to do battle
i am not expecting battle
then what is bothering you
riva
ah riva negotiated several treaties between the klingons and the federation
before him there was no klingon word for peacemaker
then i can understand why youre feeling uneasy
now look this is a simple ceremonial greeting nothing more all right
aye sir

energise



captain this is the enterprise

weve arrived safely number one but so far weve been ignored ill keep you informed

i would appreciate it

captain
sir

riva

please come closer before i start is there anything you need food refreshments
thank you no
 then proceed
greetings from the united federation of planets i am captain jean luc picard of the uss enterprise this is counsellor troi lieutenant worf
greetings
welcome to ramatis
i have been expecting you
you are empathic
yes

then although you already know my feelings toward you allow me to put them into words i am looking forward to this journey now more than ever because it gives me the chance to be in your company
i am flattered i too am look forward to learning more about you

there are aspects to riva of which we have not been informed
precisely our way of communicating has developed over the centuries and its one that i find quite harmonious
then riva the mediator
is deaf
deaf
born and hope to die
and the three of you speak for him
yes
we serve as translators we convey not only his thoughts but his emotional intent as well i am the scholar i represent the intellect and speak in matters of judgement philosophy logic also i am the dreamer the part that longs to see the beauty beyond the truth which is always the first duty of art i am the poet who
artists they tend to ramble neglect the moment i am passion the libido i am the anarchy of lust the romantic and the lover i am also the warrior the perfect line which never wavers
i am that which binds all the others together i am harmony wisdom balance
remarkable and so these

speak to me
what
speak directly to me
the uniqueness of this presentation provoked this inadvertent breach in protocol no insult was intended
then none is perceived
im curious about how this rare form of communication came about
the gene for hearing is not present in my planets ruling line
not that unusual indeed it is similar to the house of hanover of your planet earth all who had haemophilia or the leaders of fendaus five who were without limbs
many of the galaxys greatest contributors have been similarly special
my chorus is so attuned they can hear my thoughts and translate to you it is a relationship which goes back for centuries their ancestors provided the same service to my ancestors
your method of communication is most elegant and quite beautiful
it takes a fine mind to realise that counsellor troi
this part of you doesnt speak very often
only when the spirit moves me
riva if you are ready the situation at solais five is very critical we should not delay
very well
with your permission captain
make it so mister worf
enterprise this is the away team seven to beam up

commander riker the away team plus four is on board
acknowledged ensign set your course for solais five
course is set
velocity warp eight
warp eight aye
engage ensign
yes sir

what is this
riva id deaf these three speak for him treat them as interpreters address yourselves directly to riva now may i present my first officer
first captain may i say it is an honour to be on board such a fine vessel now please continue with the introductions
this is my first officer commander riker
it is an honour to meet you

lieutenant commander data
it is a pleasure to meet such a unique individual
thank you
lieutenant la forge
it is my pleasure to meet you sir
what is that youre wearing
a visor it interprets the electromagnetic spectrum and then carries the readings to my brain
and without it can you see
without it im as blind as a stump
then your visor serves the same function as my chorus which interprets my thoughts and translates them into sound
yes
and you dont resent it
the visor or being blind
either
no since theyre both part of me and i really like who i am theres no reason for me to resent either one
what is your position on the ship
im the chief engineer sir
its a blessing to understand we are special each in his own way
yes yes thats the way i feel exactly
i offer the hospitality of my vessel and at your convenience there is a briefing on the solari wars if you wish ill have you conducted to your quarters
thank you
perhaps if it is not inconvenient counsellor troi could escort me with your permission
this way

what about you
at times like this we become an encumbrance
so if you have rooms for us
lieutenant worf will escort you
rivas not what i expected

much of what we do is similar
yes i suppose in a way it is
we have both learned how to allow people to examine feelings hidden deep within their psyche in fact with you here now is provoking an emotional revelation
you mean some emotion buried in your psyche
well not that deep
exactly what are you feeling
cant you tell
some of it
well i feel that soon perhaps after the briefing by your captain that you will be hungry and that perhaps we could dine together and compare experiences
id like that
as will i
will he be with us
well until we find our own method of communication
i look forward to that time
as do i


im sorry data begin the briefing
the factions on solais five are historical enemies so many have died that both societies are on the verge of extinction
enough thank you captain there is no need to continue the specific issues of the conflict have no relevance
so none of the background which we have provided would be helpful in understanding why they continue to fight
the portfolio will indicate that the conflict is over a piece of land or wealth or some other tangible asset but we both know that is not the case
theyve been at war for so long it has become personal
exactly the basis for peace must also be personal this is an historic confrontation correct
the factions have been at war for fifteen centuries
whats changed
i do not know what you mean
they have been killing each other for a long time now they want to talk peace so something about this situation has recently changed whats the new piece to the puzzle
data
unknown sir
perhaps they have run out of people to kill in any case whatever the reason peace is now preferred which should make your job easier
well if not easier at least possible for now they are motivated but it doesnt matter ill find something i always have
always
to date i have never failed now unless there is something else
no this is for your benefit
then thank you for your time and effort
i believe i have to get ready for a dinner appointment
 if you will excuse me
yes of course the meeting is adjourned
our mediator is very self assured well know soon enough if he can deliver

were approaching solais five
half impulse
slowing to one half impulse


the sound of this ship is quite remarkable cant you feel it
yes
it moves through my body like a great pulse
ive grown so accustomed to it i forget its there
its easy to let that happen sometimes we must allow the surroundings to flow over us to dwell on each separate part how it feels to allow it to fill you

how do we communicate i know you can read lips but i need your words

words are here on top whats under them their meaning is whats important yes thats true we both know how to express important words like dream being here with you yes being here with you know is very special to me too

standard orbit
captain im reading laser activity on the solais five
how concentrated is the activity
it is localised but very intense
so much for the cease fire
hailing frequencies
im receiving one side only
this is captain jean luc picard commander of the federation starship uss enterprise if you continue to violate the cease fire i will abort this mission

you have no jurisdiction here picard where is riva
riva is in charge of the summit i command the ship that brings him i will not endanger this ship under any circumstances
the other faction is breaking through sir
riva gave his word we would speak to no one else now who breaks the rules where is riva
i shall summon him for you get riva here

counsellor troi please have riva report to the bridge
they need you on the bridge now


the cease fire has been broken
im sure i can resolve that put them on the viewscreen
viewer on
the quality of the transmission is very poor
it is sufficient
brothers your bravery as fighters is known now you must demonstrate courage in a new way cease hostilities allow us to meet
the laser fire has ceased
for how long these solari dont seem likely candidates for peace
i will need to see a topographical overlay of the battle area in order to pick a site for the meetings then i will need your help in creating the proper setting
worf prepare your security team
yes sir
thats not necessary
but it is prudent
i prefer to arrive with the smallest possible complement we do not want to add to an already tense situation
if that is your judgement so be it we are here to provide whatever service you require
thank you captain

there beam us down to that hilltop and inform the factions to join us the time for killing is come to an end

phasers on stun mister worf
you wont need those
im sure we wont energise



yes this will do it is important that we set this up properly commander if it be possible i would like torches here and here
engineering

this is the away team
yes commander
we are going to need your help
i thought you might

we would like two torches head high  and what else
a table here
describe it
three sided and if possible made to resemble indigenous rock

did you read that geordi
i did that should be no problem

when will the emissaries arrive
it shouldnt be too long
and how long do you think the negotiations will take
they wont go quickly
theyre coming commander
the first few minutes will be very tense please stay calm and do not respond even if you are provoked
well do our best

who is riva
i am riva

be at ease i commend you both to come here proves not only your courage but your wisdom please give this conference a chance
i have no magic you have been fighting all your lives you know only

no no never death first
riva

dont traitor

no wait wait
away team to enterprise beam us up now
his words are not mine please riva

we need you we need you


how did this happen
a total surprise apparently a member of one of the factions didnt like the idea of peace
i dont understand what youre trying to say counsellor
riva go slowly slowly
can you write it out i am so sorry that your friends were killed im sorry i dont know what you are trying to tell me we have to find some way to communicate with him data he knows some kind of gestural language find our which one and learn it
aye sir
counsellor take him to sickbay maybe pulaski can help  listen to me you are not alone do you understand we are all in this together now
captains log supplemental we are monitoring increased military activity on solais five i fear that without riva we will be unable to keep the solari from destroying themselves

hows it going
i have eliminated all but five distinct forms of signing i will learn them all computer show me gestural language designation m nine
interesting a technique of communication which is both silent and covert it could be very useful
the use of gestures and hand signals pre dates the spoken word in most cultures the major exception being the leyrons of malkus nine who actually developed a written language first computer continue presentation increase increase increase increase

come

hows our mediator
the same hes withdrawn hes very frightened all of his life hes been in control and now for the first time he doesnt have any answers the doctor gave him a complete medical examination
his condition is hereditary his brain cannot receive auditory information so all the prosthetics and surgical techniques i can use wouldnt work
i dont know what we can do to help him
i cant do anything
its up to him and hes stopped cooperating
counsellor couldnt you
confidence is faith in oneself it cant easily be given by another
youre right of course  come

captain i have reviewed and stored five distinct signing languages here is an example of the first this is blue this is a blue ocean this is a blue ocean at sunset this is two people walking along the beach by a blue ocean at sunset this is two happy people in love walking along the beach by a blue ocean at sunset this is two people
enough lets talk to riva


riva commander data has learned your sign language talk to us
it was my fault i am responsible for their deaths in my arrogance i thought no one could possibly harm the great riva i am such a fool
you are not to blame what happened appears to have been the work of one desperate man it may not reflect the feelings of the others
they were more than my interpreters they were also my friends they were a part of me i did not realise how much a part until now
we have been contacted by the factions on solais they want to renew negotiations
i cannot i will not
dont turn away you have a chance to make some good come out of this tragedy this could be the catalyst which binds them together
someone else will have to speak with them not me not after what i allowed to happen how could i
but data can understand you use him let him explain your words
when data speaks for me can you hear my anguish my despair data is a fine machine but he cannot take the place of my chorus it took years to develop a communication that cannot be easily replaced
the solari need you
i cannot help them captain please take me back to ramatis
that is regrettable a lot more people are going to die



its possible to install optical devices which look like normal eyes and would still give you about the same visual range as the visor
done you say almost how much reduction
twenty percent there is another option i can attempt to regenerate your optic nerve and with the help of the replicator fashion normal eyes you would see like everyone else
wait a minute i was told that was impossible
ive done it twice in situations somewhat similar to yours geordi it would eliminate the constant pain you are under why are you hesitating
well when i came to see you it was to talk about modifying this and now youre saying it could be possible for me to have normal vision
yes
i dont know id be giving up a lot
theres something else you must know this is a one shot if you decide to change your mind theres no going back and there are risks i can offer choices not guarantees
well this is a lot to think about ill get back to you doctor thank you


the captain is going to take you to ramatis but first hes given me permission to attempt to settle the conflict down on solais yes weve come so far and paid such a terrible price i must try help me
you would be better off without my help
i have never attempted anything like this before when dealing with two factions so diametrically opposed so entrenched in their positions where do you start
you want to know if i had some special technique
i want to know anything you can tell me that could help
there is no trick i had no magic
what about your chorus
yes my chorus was special they allowed me to combine different perceptions
so there was a trick
not really my technique was to look for some thing no matter how small that was common to both groups and then to begin a process where one person or one group expresses themselves to each other
thats very hard to accomplish
yes but what is even more difficult is to get each side to listen really listen to each other and to understand
this isnt going to be easy for me
you are very good with people
but what i do is different
the real secret is turning disadvantage to advantage
why cant you do that why cant you turn your disadvantage into an advantage
that is an interesting it would give them something in common  i do not understand counsellor to what is he referring

thank you thank me ah
i will have the captain contact then down on the planet and tell them to prepare for your return


there are no life signs in the immediate area
all right stay sharp we may have to get out of there in a hurry set phasers on stun energise

the area is clear commander
 put the table over there
engineering this is commander riker
go ahead sir
you can beam the table and torches down now
light the torches to let them know that i am back
it may be quite a while before the emissaries arrive theyll be more cautious after the last incident
you may leave whenever you choose i will send out a message when i am ready to go
deanna i dont understand what hes going to do how can he mediate without his interpreters he wont even be able to talk to them
riva is going to teach them sign language
yes it is turning a disadvantage into an advantage learning sign will be a part of their process of learning how to live together in peace
while they are learning how to communicate with riva theyll be learning how to communicate with each other
and that is the first and most important aspect of any relationship counsellor it took me only moments to learn sign language it will take them months
time well spent
these people have been fighting all of their lives they know only hatred suspicion and fear even with my chorus i could not have changed their attitudes in a day we have a chance they want the talks to be successful
im still not comfortable leaving you here alone
thank you for your concern i will be fine  and thank you for everything
enterprise four to beam up good luck

first officers log stardate  we leave the solais system confident that riva will help the solari achieve a lasting peace

coordinates set commander
take us out of orbit


come
you wanted to see me
yes you read me well enough to sense how i feel about you and what you do on this ship but i just wanted to say the words thank you well done
unnatural selection

captains log stardate  the enterprise is bound for star station india to rendezvous with a starfleet medical courier weve been told only that our presence is imperative hopefully the mission will give me further opportunities to assess the performance of our new chief medical officer

come

you wanted to see me captain
yes counsellor come sit down counsellor youve had the opportunity to observe doctor pulaski for some time now how would you evaluate her as a chief medical officer
ive never met a more dedicated physician i would say she has a passion for her work
yes of course i entirely agree is it possible that such consuming dedication could interfere with her judgement
i feel your concern captain but i dont share it perhaps because ive had the opportunity to spend more time with her and get to know her better
yes perhaps youre right
captain we are picking up a faint distress signal on an open subspace frequency it appears to be coming from an adjacent sector
respond on the same frequency

are you locked on to that transmission
aye sir a voice only transmission from the uss lantree a federation supply ship
uss lantree this is picard of the enterprise what is the nature of your emergency
cant hold out any more people dying too many to help
we are still receiving their signal captain but there is no message
lantree are you under attack lantree uss lantree this is the enterprise come in lantree replay that last transmission
cant hold out any more people dying too many to help
have we got a fix on her
two point two milliparsecs bearing three zero at one four five degrees
number one
wed better take a look what kind of vessel is she
the lantree is a class six federation supply ship assigned to gamma seven sector captain li telaka commanding normal complement twenty six officers and crew
armed
class three defensive only
is she still underway
aye sir
adjust course to intercept warp seven
adjusting course to intercept warp seven sir

engineering transfer to bridge
we are closing on the lantree captain
take us out of warp establish parallel course match speed
yes sir
hailing frequencies
open
lantree this is the enterprise captain telaka this is picard of the enterprise do you read me
no life signs captain
counsellor
nothing captain
what else have we got in the neighbourhood
no other vessels of any kind within two parsecs
no battle damage
all systems seem functional captain everything is in perfect order
we have to board her captain
possibly mister worf number one
if we gain control of her systems remotely we could activate the viewscreen that way we could at least look at the bridge
agreed

are you reading anything doctor
still no signs of life captain
magnify that must be captain telaka on the left lets look at him closer my god
looks like they had a battle with time
and lost
heart lungs liver everything
what is it
they died of natural causes
natural causes what in nature could cause that
for the record captain they died of old age

weve downloaded the lantrees log sir
play back the captains last entry
captains log stardate  there are only six of us left weve set course for the nearest federation outpost but i am afraid its too late all attempts to analyse what is happening have failed in the last few hours ive watched friends grow old and die and im seeing it happen to me captain li telaka uss lantree
captain telaka was my age sir
doctor
every member of the lantree crew had a complete examination at the beginning of this duty cycle eight weeks ago they were in perfect health
nothing else since
a single medical entry noting that the first officer was treated for thelusian flu five days ago
thelusian flu
its an exotic but harmless rhinal virus it couldnt have caused this
the last port of call of the lantree was the darwin genetic research station on gagarin four three days ago
whatever happened it could be something that the lantree crew already had or it could have come from gagarin at the very least the people from darwin station deserve a warning we may have to consider a quarantine
youll agree that we should quarantine the lantree
absolutely
lieutenant initiate the quarantine transmitters on the lantree and activate her marker beacons well need to find her again
aye sir

quarantine warnings active on all frequencies captain
extreme caution the uss lantree is a quarantined vessel by order of starfleet command do not board
set course for gagarin four warp seven
course and speed set sir
engage
captains log supplemental were en route to the federation research station on gagarin four the mere thought of a possible connection between the lantree tragedy and a genetic research facility fills me with profound apprehension

were approaching gagarin four captain
standard orbit mister crusher
aye sir
hailing frequencies
open
darwin station this is captain jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise

enterprise this is darwin station im doctor kingsley weve just declared a medical emergency here we need your help
doctor kingsley what is the nature of your emergency
to whom am i speaking please
im doctor pulaski chief medical officer
katherine pulaski author of linear models of viral propagation
that was a long time ago
but still the standard i cant think of anyone id rather be dealing with doctor were experiencing the rapid onset of geriatric phenomena the first symptom is sudden acute arthritic inflammation then the aging process accelerates
the lantree
doctor pulaski i celebrated my thirty fifth birthday a week ago
doctor we understand that darwin station is involved in genetic research is there a possible connection
our research here is limited to human genetics i can assure you were not dealing with something that got away from us we believe that we were infected by a supply ship that was here three days ago
doctor if youre speaking of the lantree we encountered it a few hours ago all the crew members were dead
which would seem to confirm our suspicion were you able to establish a pathology doctor
doctor did you hear what i said all the twenty six men and women aboard that ship were dead
i heard you captain and the prognosis is alarming but my immediate concern is our children
children
they represent years of advanced genetic research you must evacuate them as soon as possible
im sorry but under the circumstances until we know whats going on im imposing a full quarantine on darwin station
but the children have been in protective isolation since this was detected they show no symptoms you cannot leave them here to die
doctor our options in a quarantine situation are extremely limited we are going to consider the possibilities i suggest you do the same

i recommend against contact captain
number one
i have to agree sir i wish there was something we could do but the risk is too great
doctor
if the children are free of disease as doctor kingsley said they should be evacuated i would like to bring one of them aboard within a force field for a complete examination
counsellor do you sense anything
doctor kingsley sincerely believes the children are not a threat but shes not telling us the whole truth i recommend caution
we have only doctor kingsleys assurance that these children are not infected whereas we have seen the results of this disease first hand in a case like this i think we should err on the side of caution
all right we could beam up one child in styrolite in suspended animation that way i could scan for possible infection without any danger to ourselves or to the child
but we dont know what were looking for
exactly and we wont know until we begin gathering data captain thats worth some risk
theres always risk doctor proceed with the examination but i shall require positive proof that these children are harmless before i place any of my crew in jeopardy

the forcefields ready captain
activate it

transporter
this is chief obrien sir almost ready
is there a problem

its the styrolite im altering the deltat so the styrolite coding materialises two microseconds ahead of the child

it has to be right the first time
well take all the time you need
entering corrections now sir

ready captain

doctor kingsley are you ready to transport
you have the coordinates we have one twelve year old male encased in number six styrolite
transporter energise

a trick
transporter reverse
one moment lieutenant whoever he is hes still in stasis
the styrolite is intact captain
force field down
captain theres a definite presence a distinct personality even in stasis its quite strong the child is unquestionably telepathic
a child this mature we could be looking at the future of humanity
at least doctor kingsleys vision of it

this child is in better health than we are his immune system is so advanced it may not be possible for him to contract disease i want to free him from the styrolite
that seems rather risky doctor
i can do no further tests until hes out of it
but what if youre wrong you saw what happened on the lantree
i know im right
i cant expose the enterprise until i know where this disease came from and how it is transmitted
i realise that captain naturally well establish a force field containment
but if we lose the force field for any reason we lose the ship force fields can fail and until
we dont have that kind of time these children cant survive in the lab once their parents are dead look at him captain hes a human being who needs our help
but the risk is
minimal
if you can demonstrate that he is biologically harmless without risk to the crew ill do everything in my power to assist and doctor god knows im not one to discourage input but i would appreciate it if youd let me finish my sentences once in a while

deanna do you have a minute youve known the captain for some time i think i need some advice i dont seem to be dealing with him very well
why do you say that
well my arguments dont seem to have any affect on him we just end up quoting regulations to each other he has such a consuming dedication to his ship he doesnt seem able to step back to see the human side of the equation

whats the matter
kate i dont think hed be where he is if he couldnt see the human side of the equation perhaps the two of you arent all that different
what do you mean
lets just say you both have well established personalities

doctor kingsley this is kate pulaski
doctor do you have a decision
im afraid its bad news
how can that be
the risk to the ship and crew is too great until we absolutely know the cause of the disease the children
the children are harmless every test on them has been negative i demand that you do something to save them please doctor for gods sake we havent got much time
stand by ill get back to you

geordi i need your help
what is it doctor
i need to prove the children are harmless i can only do that in a failsafe environment
the problem is theres no area on the ship that can be sealed off with absolute certainty even with force fields
sickbay has an isolated system
but its not possible to totally cut it off from the rest of the ship the only truly independent environment would be something like a shuttlecraft
a shuttlecraft why didnt you say so

come
captain id like permission to put the boy in a shuttlecraft i can study him there without risk to anyone else
what about you
im prepared to take that risk someone has to breathe the same air he breathes to touch him im volunteering to make that test myself
doctor you have a responsibility to this ship which goes
i also have a responsibility to humanity
starfleet guidelines about contact with quarantined
you dont have to quote the rule book you were saying
request approved
captain you said if i approved
i recognise that youre trying to satisfy my conditions
thank you


you sent for me doctor
i did commander i assume that youre qualified to pilot this shuttlecraft
certainly i took advanced training in the operation of auxiliary space vessels at starfleet academy where i received
a more than passing grade no doubt please come aboard we dont have much time
shuttlebay three force field activated

youre certain the captain approved this doctor
youll take us a few hundred metres away from the enterprise and hold position
begin shuttlecraft launch sequence

good luck doctor

we are in position doctor
its the only way to prove theyre harmless
and if they are not
i hate to keep reminding you but you are a machine youll be perfectly safe
that is by no means certain doctor but i was referring to you
medical research is sometimes a risky business its all part of being human shall we proceed
ready to transport

you have the coordinates chief obrien
shuttlecraft maintain your position and stand by
standing by

transporter control whats our status

we have a green panel sir

stand by to transport
aye sir
energise


oh yes i do i understand you perfectly
how could you doctor he has not said anything
oh yes he has trois right hes telepathic

time
zero three two two exactly
shes been in direct contact with the boy for eighteen minutes


all systems are functioning within normal specifications doctor
the manufacturer will be pleased to hear it i appreciate your help but your bedside manner needs work
bedside manner

doctor
doctor i dont understand what has happened
there was no warning
explain
arthritic inflammation its the initial symptom of the disease
what can we do
return the boy to darwin station apparently the children are carriers

chief obrien are you ready
i have the original coordinates of the darwin isolation lab captain
quickly please
shuttle one hold your position

holding

stand by to transport
it wasnt your fault

tell us what you need doctor
theres nothing you can do captain im not going to make myself an exception to the darwin quarantine shuttle one out
what is your condition doctor
not exactly up to factory specs im sorry the pain is tolerable thank you
shall i set course for darwin station
were already under quarantined what do we have to lose

we can no longer consider the darwin station crisis our most immediate concern although doctor pulaskis condition is inseparably linked with that emergency her safe return and that of commander data must take priority please
shouldnt doctor pulaski be involved in this
from what weve seen on the lantree doctor pulaski may not have time to help herself
well i suggest we beam them both back onto the ship commander data is most likely immune and surely the biofilter will
the transporters biofilter wont protect us the boy was transported twice already and still infected doctor pulaski
couldnt we adjust the biofilter we could alter the filter to screen out whatever it is thats causing the disease
but we dont know whats causing the disease we cant protect ourselves against the unknown what we need is some kind of filter that doesnt depend on known biological factors
we might try the trace
the transporter trace
as you know the transporter keeps a record of all transmissions a pattern if you will usually its just stored for security purposes but if we use the transporter trace to control the reconstitution process
i dont think its ever been tried quite that way before but theoretically it is possible
id have to make extensive modifications
then do it it seems we have no alternative
where will we get the trace pattern the doctors never used our transporter
never
no shes a woman of very strongly held opinions sir what was her previous assignment
her last ship was the repulse
bridge picard contact the uss repulse using subspace captains priority channel

oh doctor pulaski i can only tell you how much i regret the burden weve imposed on you on both of you
commander data is an android doctor he is unaffected as for me i chose this i was convinced the children were safe
i still cant believe you were infected by one of our children
the evidence is fairly conclusive
you dont understand they were designed to resist disease
i think its time we talked about that
let me show you something

our ultimate achievement the oldest is twelve and all are telekinetic watch

genetically engineered
not engineered created perfect in every way their body structure their musculature their minds
you were telling me about their immune system
that was our masterpiece we gave these children an aggressive immunity the rest of us were infected by the supply ship but they were protected
the lantree logs indicated that only one crewman had any illness prior to arrival here the first officer had a mild case of thelusian flu
yes he was one of the crewmen who came in direct contact with us
the thelusian flu would have little effect on you but tell me how would they react
their immune system would release an active antibody that would attack the virus
even at a distance
their immune systems dont wait for a disease to attack the body it would seek out an airborne virus and destroy it
destroy it how exactly
the antibody would adapt itself to alter the genetic code of the virus
commander i want an analysis of the interaction between the thelusian flu and the children
on a molecular genetic level
we dont have time for that genetic analysis could take months
not necessarily commander data has a way with computers

sorry picard we erased doctor pulaskis transporter pattern right after she transferred not that she used the transporter much she preferred using the shuttlecraft i would have given her a shuttle if it would have kept her here
tell me taggert if she served you as well as you say why did you let her go
i see you havent run into her stubborn streak yet as soon as she found out about an opening on the enterprise she put in a request for transfer knew your service record backward and forward apparently shes been an admirer of yours for some time
extraordinary

commander what have you got
the answer i believe doctor the lantree was not the source of the disease but it was the trigger
trigger
the lantrees first officer exposed your children to thelusian flu for the first time their active immune systems set out to attack the virus and once it was triggered it kept going the antibody created an unexpected sideeffect it alters the genetic makeup of normal humans this is a comparison of the normal and altered dna these are the two molecules that have been transposed
and since our dna is self replicating the process
is irreversible
judging from what happened on the lantree anyone is a carrier once theyre infected

have you made any progress doctor
im afraid so captain the children dont carry the disease they are the cause
what do you mean
their advanced immune system has created an antibody that changes normal dna the altered genes are the ones that control aging
then why did it attack you more quickly than doctor kingsley
the enclosed environment of the shuttlecraft concentrated my exposure the lantrees first officer carried the antibody onto his ship it had the same effect on his crew
right whats the next step
the children will survive but the rest of us are just about out of time
doctor i want you back aboard this ship well beam you up in suspended animation like the boy that will give us more time
captain i appreciate what youre trying to do but i got into this by leaping before i looked and i wont allow you to make the same mistake chief medical officers log this will be my final report to the enterprise just as changes in evolution are known to be caused by changes in the environment we now know the process also works in reverse an attempt to control human evolution has resulted in a new species thats lethal to its predecessors the children will be condemned to live out their lives in isolation quarantine of the darwin station must be maintained for ever


i am sorry i could not be more helpful doctor pulaski
you did everything you could commander as androids go youre in a class by yourself
doctor
please give my best to the captain
enterprise commander data ready to beam aboard

captain kate knew what she was doing
i wish i could be certain that wed tried everything
commander data is ready to come aboard sir
you have the bridge number one

no life forms present
you may step down sir
data tell me if its good to see you again
thank you sir
now quickly if the changes in doctor pulaskis dna were reversed would it be possible
it is not reversible sir the subtle molecular transposition of
yes yes yes but say if it were undone would she be normal again
as normal as ever sir
you said that the transporter could be modified to filter out the changes in doctor pulaski
yes sir but we were unable to locate her trace pattern
well what if we used a sample of her dna say from a blood test taken before she was exposed to the disease could that be used to filter out the genetic changes
well id have to get into the biofilter bus to patch in a molecular matrix reader thats no problem but the waveform modulator will be overloaded without the regeneration limiter in the first stage circuit
interesting however theoretically
data
yes sir
can you do the modifications
i think so sir
then make it so
you heard what he said lets get those panels off

a blood test a tissue sample anything that would have a sample of doctor pulaskis original dna
no sir her records were shipped by way of starfleet headquarters they have not caught up with us yet
this is ridiculous a cell a single cell lets check her quarters

anything a fingernail a hair
hair brush

it has a follicle sir live cells

darwin station this is the enterprise
go ahead captain im here
doctor we may have a solution we have a sample of your normal dna to use as a filter in the transporter we think that we can beam you aboard while filtering out any of the genetic problems caused by the disease
interesting theory captain if it works we could use the same technique to save doctor kingsley and her colleagues
i think you should know this has never been attempted before
well ill tell you one thing if i live through this ill have a much better understanding of geriatrics


all set chief
almost ready sir theres just one thing
yes
this modifications one way only if it doesnt work we wont be able to reverse transport the doctor back to the planet
then ill operate the transporter controls myself if shes going to be consigned to oblivion then
thank you sir ill be monitoring the medical scans but youll be able to tell if its worked by watching the stack
doctor pulaski are you ready
i suppose i am captain
here we go

its not working
captain wait

doctor
good to see you doctor
welcome back doctor come

captain if this hadnt worked
if this hadnt worked it would have been necessary to beam your energy into empty space
and spread my atoms spread across the galaxy
yes im sorry
no no dont be sorry every time i get into the damn thing im convinced thats whats going to happen

impulse speed
there she is captain
 scientists believe no experiment is a failure that even a mistake advances the evolution of understanding
close to forty kilometres
forty kilometres aye sir
but all achievement has a price for one brief glimpse at the mysterious blueprint of human evolution the men and women off the uss lantree paid with their lives their sacrifice is thus noted in this scientists log

lieutenant worf arm the photon torpedoes
torpedoes ready commander
extreme caution the uss lantree is a quarantined vessel by order of starfleet command do not board

gentlemen
extreme caution the uss lantree is a quarantined vessel by order of starfleet command do not board

set course and speed for star station india
course and speed set sir
engage
a matter of honour


we are approaching starbase one seven nine
half impulse mister crusher
going to half impulse
captain this is the bridge we have arrived at starbase one seven nine
acknowledged number one
establish position zero nine zero mark three four five at twenty seven thousand kilometres hailing frequencies
open
starbase one seven nine this is the enterprise
enterprise this is starbase one seven nine we are ready for transfer on your mark
thank you commander data you have the bridge ensign crusher youre with me
starbase one seven nine we are ready to commence transfer
acknowledged enterprise begin transfer


welcome aboard the enterprise im commander william riker your first officer those of you who are here as replacements will step outside follow lieutenant lewis he will assign you to your crew quarters  ensign youre here on the exchange programme if youll just follow mister crusher
mordoc what are you doing here you couldnt have graduated from the academy already
i am not mordoc i am mendon ensign mendon from the planet benzar
sorry its a friend of mine you look just like him
we are from the same geostructure naturally we look alike
how do you tell each other apart
we just do
its nice to have you here ensign there will be a briefing and indoctrination session in fifteen minutes
i want to tell you how happy i am to be assigned to the enterprise it wasnt just luck i requested it i know i can be of great help to the ship
yes of course if youll just follow mister crusher
yes sir
commander riker report to the phaser range please
on the way


i was wondering if you had any feelings about the officer exchange programme initiated by starfleet command
just positive ones sir actually i just welcomed ensign mendon on board he certainly seems eager to please
well thats a benzite trait its been suggested that an officer from the enterprise might participate in the programme
thats probably a good idea
well there is a klingon vessel in the area
i dont recall hearing of a federation officer serving ever on a klingon vessel
no no neither have i
it might prove to be beneficial
having worf on board certainly has been
yes sir who did you intend to send sir
i thought of asking for a volunteer
i might be interested sir
 damn sorry number one what was that
i said i wouldnt mind the assignment sir
any particular reason
because nobodys ever done it before
ill notify starbase of your acceptance theyll contact the klingon vessel make the arrangements
captains log stardate  we have departed from starbase one seven nine and are headed for a rendezvous with the klingon vessel pagh i have informed the staff of commander rikers temporary assignment

i have studied and know everything about my heritage
then youre just the person i need to talk to clear something up its my understanding that one of the duties of the first officer of a klingon ship is to assassinate his captain
yes sir
wouldnt that bring about chaos
of course not when and if the captain becomes weak and unable to perform it is expected that his honourable retirement should be assisted by his first your second officer will assassinate you for the same reasons
the method of attrition must take a little getting used to
the klingon system has operated successfully for centuries
it is different
many things will be different


 can i help you sir
thats a wonderful method of maintaining a constant control factor over defensive shields but im sure theres a way to improve response time sorry didnt mean to interrupt you just thought i could be of some help however i am correct in what i said

that is superb designing absolutely first rate
yes it is would you care to be more specific
the input sampling its simple yet efficient enough of course a minor change of the helm readout would be much more helpful in emergency situations
weve never had any problems with it have you seen it work
not in a practical exercise but in theory my theory it would be more than a marginal improvement ill have to mention this to the captain he is open to some astute observations isnt he
ive never known the captain not to listen to one of his officers
outstanding soon well get things running perfectly


what is that
its a klingon delicacy pipius claw this is heart of targ this of course is gagh
gagh
yes serpent worms would you like some
no thanks ive never heard of a klingon starving to death on his own vessels but you might
not if i weaken first
i know all about that their beliefs are rather brutal but usually what kills us kills them
thats certainly good to know would you like something to drink
im abstaining in honour of your last hour on board
your sacrifice will not go unnoticed
well im familiar with the practice of the feast before the transfer ive done it dozens of times however i usually made more palatable choices
these are the more palatable choices

thank you we know so little about them there really is so much to learn this is a great opportunity i envy you mister riker


commander

an emergency transponder
slightly altered to transmit an omnidirectional signal and an emergency call
you suspect trouble
simply a security precaution i want to insure your return to this ship
sentiment lieutenant worf
efficiency commander
i understand thank you

we have a klingon vessel approaching
hailing frequencies
open they are returning our hail in proper language it is the pagh
on viewscreen im captain picard of the enterprise
this is captain kargan of the klingon vessel the pagh beam your first officer on board immediately
we are preparing to do so and captain youre getting a fine officer
thank you for your opinion but i will judge that for myself screen off
not very hospitable are they
that is not your concern observe your station ensign mendon
didnt mean to offend you
you didnt yet

transporter prepare to beam commander riker aboard the pagh
acknowledged captain
mister data you have the bridge
aye sir

good luck commander
thanks obrien
i wouldnt want to go
why
youre not afraid are you
no im not
i would be ready sir
thanks energise


resume course mister crusher
aye sir
take over commander data ill be in observation
thank you sir
sir i am ensign mendon i just wanted to tell you how pleased i am to be aboard the enterprise
yes of course good to have you aboard
if you have a few minutes ive noted a few procedural items which might speed up operations on the bridge i pick things up very fast
yes of course you do you have an excellent record however here on the enterprise we use the chain of command you will report your observations to lieutenant worf
i beg your pardon captain i just wanted to impress upon you
no need to apologise ensign we should have explained it better to you at your indoctrination

ensign mendon you may impress me



is something wrong
no its just i have never seen anyone of your species before
im just an average everyday human who happens to be a commander now what were your orders
to escort you to the captain
proceed
yes commander


commander william riker of the starship enterprise
that is incorrect
i dont understand
you are commander william riker first officer of the klingon cruiser the pagh or do you intend to disobey federation orders
i have no such intention sir
exactly where are your loyalties commander
im afraid i still dont understand sir
this ship is equipped with our best weapons and our finest warriors although we are on a peaceful mission we are ready to go into battle instantly i know i can count on every klingon warrior in this crew to serve and die in that battle so i ask you again commander riker where are your loyalties
i have been assigned to serve this ship and to obey your orders and i will do exactly that
will you take an oath to that effect
i just did
 do not believe him he lies
 speak in their language this is your second officer lieutenant klag
is there something you wanted to say to me lieutenant
yes sir i do not believe you
then i take it you challenge my authority over you
correct
and your position on this captain
i would say it your first command decision

my oath is between captain kargan and myself your only concern is with how you obey my orders or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant
i will take your orders
and you commander riker will obey my orders
of course captain kargan

sir automatic scan has registered an unknown substance on the aft quarter of the exterior skin of the dorsal section
target that location and define
aye sir
ive located it sir the dorsal of the engineering section
viewscreen on focus on area magnification factor ten increase magnification to fifty

analyse
the substance appears to be a rare form of subatomic bacteria capable of doubling itself in size every fifteen minutes it seems to be reacting with two of the compounds present in the enterprise structure
origin
captain i noticed it when i did an intensive scan of the pagh the klingon ship
and whom did you inform
no one i have not yet completed my full analysis
you are supposed to report whatever is out of the ordinary
and i think that falls into this category
but sir as i said i have not yet completed my full analysis it would be improper to report it until then
how did you come to that decision
it is a benzite regulation no officer on the deck of one of our ships would report an occurrence like this until he had a full analysis and a resolution i have simply followed proper procedures
it is our procedure ensign to notify command of any possibility of danger to the ship the decision is not yours do you understand
yes sir
now you will continue with your analysis and determine the danger not only to our ship but the klingon vessel also
yes captain that will take a couple of hours
use whatever resources are necessary it appears we may have encountered a new life form i want to know everything about it as quickly as possible commander data supervise
aye sir

and then i will instruct you in enterprise etiquette
first officers personal log i have aboard the pagh a short time but long enough to be impressed with the abilities and singlemindedness of the klingons

commander youre not eating very much
im not that hungry
is the food all right commander
its delicious the pipius claw was excellent i also enjoyed this bregit lungs
and the rokeg blood pie
delicious
good then youll also enjoy this
isnt that gagh
very good you did some research on our nutritional choices
yes but its still moving
gagh is always best when served live would you like something easier
easier
yes if klingon food is too strong for you perhaps we could get one of the females to breast feed you

youre not worried about my weakening are you
look around you there are no old warriors
no sir im sure they all died with honour
exactly you may live long enough to learn about us
he is not very attractive but i will have him
they are inquisitive they would like to know how you would endure
endure what
them
one or both

i may be back for you
is she serious
yes

commander would you say youre a typical federation officer
i suppose so why
well its just youre not what i expected
in what way
you have a sense of humour
i was thinking the same thing about you in all my dealings with klingons including our lieutenant worf the thought never occurred to me of klingons laughing
there is much about us you do not know
thats why im here
you should ask
i may after this tour i may have some worthy questions
questions about what about our future our future is honour our present is serving this ship
like you i have a mother and a father they look like me i look like them
are they still alive
my mother lives my father was killed in battle at tranome sar
and your father
my father my father was captured in battle by romulans and not allowed to die he eventually escaped
where is he now
he is on our planet he waits
he waits for his death
he will eventually fade of a natural illness and die weakened and useless honourless i will not see him
hes your father
a klingon is his work not his family that is the way of things
hes your father
klingons do not express feeling the way you do
perhaps you should
we would not know how
yesterday i did not know how to eat gagh

it is confirmed that the organisms feed on some of the compounds that make up the hull of the enterprise
and the klingon ship the pagh
they are much more susceptible their hull contains more of the compounds
projection
according to the rate of reproduction there should be a twelve centimetre opening in the klingon hull at this time
signal them at once they could be unaware of the danger they may need our help
aye sir
change course to intercept
aye sir
it will take some time to locate them sir they are on undesignated manoeuvres in the pheben system
find them

tell me commander riker what do you make of this

i felt no collision were we hit by a small meteor
no no collision
corrosion then
no not corrosion
science station analyse
we already have and fortunately the cavity opened onto a section that could withstand the change in pressure
then what is it
a space organism eating away at our hull
what are you talking about what is it i mean you must have some way to repair it
im afraid not
our estimate is that in less than eight hours we will have lost too much of our shell to remain intact
the only vessel weve had contact with recently is the enterprise
there was no direct contact with the enterprise
tactics officer report to commander riker
the enterprise did conduct an extensive scan of this vessel
thats normal procedure
what type of beam did the enterprise use to cause this damage in our hull
none why would they do that were allies
but my logs indicate that the enterprise directed an intense scanning beam at this specific area for a duration of two minutes
explain that
i cant
it could be a weapon
its no weapon the enterprise has no reason to do that especially with me on board it makes no sense why
why is no longer important what is important is our response to this attack engage cloaking device change course to intercept the enterprise
what do you intend to do captain
intend there is only one response i intend to attack the enterprise and destroy it

youre making some progress youve eliminated half the possibilities already
thank you but i seem to have become efficient a little later than was needed it was my responsibility to learn and adapt to the enterprises regulations and i didnt do that
not really you just made an error captain picard may not like them but he knows they turn up from time to time
i failed i had an opportunity to show the captain my superior capabilities and i failed i can never recover from that
mendon it was a mistake you didnt put the organism on the hull you discovered it you were trying to analyze it and messed up on protocol a little
i realise youre trying to be nice to me and i appreciate it what i dont understand is why
why not i thought you could use a friend
thank you i only hope i can learn your ways before i mess up again i imagine my methods must seem foolish to you
theyre different but thats what this exchange programme is all about you learn the way we do things and take that information back to your command its up to them to decide which is better
youre right ill do it your way ill work even harder than i did before and ill succeed brilliantly


what is the status
unchanged the rate of increase continues
commander riker check the organism growth with engineering

keep him under scrutiny
captain im not convinced riker knew of any plot against us if he did why would he have come on board
because he was ordered to
to die
its the expectation of any officer to be ordered to die at any time
for a klingon perhaps but rikers people do not volunteer for death so easily he may be a spy but hes no coward
that only proves that he is intelligent and you might not be as strong as you used to be
captain ive picked up the enterprise
so soon
the enterprise is on an intercept course with us

you almost had me believing this was a misunderstanding
but
the enterprise has changed course and is following us why
ask them
the reason is obvious their intent is clear how long before we make contact
less than fifteen minutes sir
put the ship on full battle alert arm all photon torpedoes let them charge into their destruction

captain our bearings show that we should be in contact with the klingon vessel now
slow to impulse
aye sir impulse speed
hailing frequencies are open there is no response
continue transmitting
the pagh is either cloaked or destroyed sir
conduct an intensive scan of the area

the enterprise has slowed to impulse speed and is making an intensive sweep
hold your position let them come to us
they may be here to help you dont be a fool
do not forget my rank
i havent i am simply trying to help you understand
i understand fully now you understand i am still captain of this vessel and you are still crew and sworn to obey me you gave me your oath
yes sir i did
then fulfill that oath and serve this ship as you swore to tell me of the surest method of attack against the enterprise
i wont
you must it is a matter of honour and loyalty to your oath
i will not surrender the secrets of the enterprise to you
if your word is no good then how can we ever trust starfleet
i will not break any vow i have taken in the past i have also taken an oath a loyalty to your ship i will not break that
they are in conflict
no sir they are not i will obey your orders i will serve this ship as first officer and in an attack against the enterprise i will die along with this crew but i will not break my oath of loyalty to starfleet
if you had told those secrets about the enterprise i would have labeled you a traitor and killed you where you stood but instead you will die with us youll die like a klingon

sir i have something to report to you immediately
yes go ahead ensign
i have managed to isolate the organisms on our hull they are a submicron form capable of breaking nuclear bonds in the tritanium plating
but can they be removed from the hull
yes they are controllable and can be removed from the hulls of both ships by using a tunnelling neutrino beam
thank you ensign well done initiate that procedure  lieutenant add that information to hailing messages
aye sir

lieutenant
the enterprise has changed hailing messages they now include a promise of cleaning the organisms and helping in repairs
i told you theyre here to help
i do not believe them arm all weapons prepare to attack
captains log stardate  although our search has been extensive we are still unable to locate the klingon ship or any evidence of its destruction

considering the absence of debris captain it is reasonable to assume the klingon vessel is in the area and cloaked
agreed
and since we do not know its intent i recommend we go to red alert
make it so lieutenant
aye sir

the enterprise has raised its shields
thats normal procedure when entering into a suspicious situation its not an act of aggression the enterprise will not fire first
then they are fools for we will
youll get only one shot
well only need one stand by on phasers and torpedoes prepare to fire them simultaneously
i recommend you dont fire until youre within forty thousand kilometres
why
it will cut down their response time
you are honouring your promise to serve us
would you do less
you will give the order to fire commander riker call out distances any questions mister riker
theres one thing id like to say i question your judgment in my opinion your reason for forcing this confrontation is not valid
are you finished
yes sir
commence with attack as ordered
fifty five thousand kilometres and closing

is that a weapon commander
no sir

give it to me

we are getting an emergency signal from a command transponder location zero three five mark three one three frequency and code designate it as commander riker
chief obrien lock onto that transponder signal

yes captain were not yet in safe range for a transfer

and defensive shields are still in place
we may have to stretch it

we have to know whats going on

and commander riker is the only one who can tell us beam him directly here onto the bridge

on my command
yes sir ill wait till forty thousand

forty eight thousand forty four thousand
transporter room stand by

you control the shields
ready sir

forty thousand

forty thousand kilometres
prepare to drop cloaking shields and fire when ready steady

transporter room energise


hold where you are klag ive relieved captain kargan he was acting in an irrational manner im your captain now serve this ship as i have

where am i
youre on board the starship enterprise
riker has no honour he tricked me

hes only dazed sir
well thats fine but wheres commander riker

cloaking shields off obey my orders
we will be destroyed
if we are it will be in battle and i will die with you so i repeat cloaking shields off

it is the pagh sir
it has all armament locked on us and ready to fire
hold this position hailing frequencies calling the pagh this is the enterprise we are here to assist do not fire
they will not believe you

pagh were here to assist do you read me

enterprise this is captain william riker of the klingon vessel pagh i order you to lower your shields and surrender
lower shields surrender as ordered
i demand to be beamed back aboard my vessel
transporter chief prepare to beam captain kargan back aboard the pagh
aye sir
captain riker we can carry out your repairs immediately
thank you captain picard

you should have killed me
i dont want your command
but you tricked me to get it
either way you can have it back
then return to your station

get him off my ship
yes captain you understand the klingons better than i thought commander
thank you my friend

that might have been one of the shortest assignments in the history of starfleet
wrong number one it was almost the longest well done
thank you actually i learned quite a bit
apparently not when to duck
when not to duck would be more accurate
welcome aboard number one now lieutenant conduct the commander to sickbay
aye sir commander

your little toy worked thanks
im glad it did
you come from a very brave and unique people im glad youre with us on the enterprise
thank you commander and welcome home
the measure of a man

captains log stardate  we are en route to newly established starbase one seven three for port call crew rotation is scheduled and we will be offloading experiment modules

 obrien and riker are sitting down for an evenings entertainment
hold it thats my chair my luck is always lousy unless i start on the dealers right
that would seem to be superstition
bitter experience has taught me its a fundamental truth
okay the game is five card stud nothing wild ante up
this game is exceedingly simple with only fifty two cards twenty one of which i will see and four other players there are a limited number of winning combinations
theres more to this than just the cards data
of course the bets will indicate of the relative strength of each hand
time to pluck a pigeon

five
im in
i too
call

a seven and a six and the ace
i bet ten
see that
call
fold
yeah me too im out

i bet five
same
your five and five

too rich for me

no help

i bet ten
your ten and ten

is that what is known as a poker face
are you playing or not
i fold

you had nothing
he bluffed you data
it makes very little sense to bet when you cannot win
but i did win i was betting that you wouldnt call
how could you tell
instinct data instinct the game is seven card highlow with a buy on the last card and just to make it more interesting the man with the axe takes all



my god  phillipa louvois and back in uniform its been ten years but seeing you again like this makes it seem like fifty if we werent around all these people do you know what i would like to do
bust a chair across my teeth
after that
aint love wonderful

so what are you doing out here
i am in charge of the twenty third sector jag office were brand new i have no staff but one terrified little ensign hopefully we can make some good law out here
anything is possible so you came back to starfleet
still the most exciting and worthwhile place to be
you had no reason to leave
they forced me out
no that was your own damn stubborn pride
when i prosecuted you in the stargazer court martial i was doing my job
oh you did more than your job you enjoyed it
not true a court martial is standard procedure when a ship is lost i was doing my duty as an officer of the judge advocate general
you always enjoyed the adversarial process more than arriving at the truth well i hope youve learned a little wisdom along the way
you know i never thought i would say this but its good to see you again it brings a sense of order and stability to my universe to know that youre still a pompous ass and a damn sexy man
captain picard
admiral
captain louvois youre acquainted with captain picard
oh yes were old friends excuse me picard call me you can buy me dinner

captain its good to see you again
admiral
may i present commander bruce maddox
commander
he has an interesting proposal for you but that can wait for a while im eager to see the enterprise
yes sir this way

admiral on the bridge
i was a little surprised at the decision to put a base in force so close to the neutral zone
as you know weve had disturbing news from both sides of the zone were here to respond when needed and it wont hurt to have the romulans know that were nearby well captain i want to thank you for this opportunity for five hundred years every ship that has borne the name of the enterprise has been a legend this one is no different
admiral
oh yes captain commander maddox is here to do some work on your android please take care of him

how have you been data
my condition does not alter with the passage of time commander
the two of you are acquainted
yes i evaluated data when it first applied to the academy
and was the sole member of the committee to oppose my entrance on the grounds that i was not a sentient being
what exactly will this work entail
i am going to disassemble data

all right explain this procedure
ever since i first saw data at the entrance evaluation at the starfleet academy ive wanted to understand it i became a student of the works of doctor noonien soong datas creator and ive tried to continue his work i believe i am very close to the breakthrough that will enable me to duplicate doctor soongs work and replicate this but as a first step i must disassemble and study it data is going to be my guide
data
it sounds intriguing
how will you proceed
i will run a full diagnostic on data evaluating the condition of its current software i will then dump its core memory into the starbase mainframe computer and begin a detailed analysis of its construction
youve constructed a positronic brain
yes
have you determined how the electron resistance across the neural filaments is to be resolved
not precisely
that would seem to be a necessary first step
i am confident that i will find the answer once i examine the filament links in your anterior cortex
but if the answer is not forthcoming your model will not function
i do not anticipate any problems
you seem a little vague on the specifics
what are the risks to commander data
negligible
captain i believe his basic research lacks the specifics necessary to support an experiment of this magnitude
commander data is a valued member of my bridge crew based on what ive heard i cannot allow commander data to submit himself to this experiment
i was afraid this might be your attitude captain here are starfleets transfer orders separating commander data from the enterprise and reassigning it to starbase one seventy three under my command data i will see you in my office tomorrow at zero nine hundred hours

come

you sent for me sir
data please sit down well we have a problem
i find myself in complete agreement with that assessment of the situation sir
your service to this ship has been exemplary i dont want to lose you
i will not submit to the procedure sir
data i understand your objections but i have to consider starfleets interests what if commander maddox is correct there is a possibility that many more beings like yourself could be constructed
sir lieutenant la forges eyes are far superior to human biological eyes true then why are not all human officers required to have their eyes replaced with cybernetic implants  i see it is precisely because i am not human
that will be all mister data

computer pull all relevant information with regard to starfleet regulations on the transfer of officers
working

my god twice in as many days
i need your help
an historic moment
i have been trying to make sense of this gobbledygook but its beyond me the fact is my android officer data is being transferred compulsorily to be made part of a highly dangerous illconceived experiment and i want it stopped
he can refuse to undergo the procedure but we cant stop the transfer
once this maddox has got control of data anything could happen i dont trust that man
we agree to certain risks when we join starfleet
yes acceptable risks justified risks but i cant accept this its unjustified its unfair he has rights
all this passion over a machine
dont start this is important to me is there an option
there is always an option he can resign
i see
so you came to me for help
yes i came to you youre the jag officer for this sector i had no choice but to come to you
wait i didnt mean it that way im glad that you felt you could well come to me
the word trust just isnt in your vocabulary is it good try nine out of ten for effort
i wish things were different
i wish i could believe that


when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes i all alone beweep my outcast state is it just words to you or do you fathom the meaning

is it not customary to request permission before entering an individuals quarters
i thought that we could talk this out that i could try to persuade you your memories and knowledge will remain intact
reduced to the mere facts of the events the substance the flavour of the moment could be lost take games of chance
games of chance
yes i had read and absorbed every treatise and textbook on the subject and felt myself well prepared for the experience yet when i finally played poker i discovered that the reality bore little resemblance to the rules
and the point being
that while i believe it is possible to download the information contained in the positronic brain i do not think you have acquired the expertise necessary to preserve the essence of those experiences there is an ineffable quality to memory which i do not believe can survive your procedure
ineffable quality i had rather we had done this together but one way or the other we are doing it you are under my command
no sir i am not under your nor anyone elses command i have resigned from starfleet
resigned you cant resign
i regret the decision but i must i am the culmination of one mans dream this is not ego or vanity but when doctor soong created me he added to the substance of the universe if by your experiments i am destroyed something unique something wonderful will be lost i cannot permit that i must protect his dream
and so must i but keep packing because one way or the other you will be reporting
captains log supplemental commander bruce maddox having been thwarted by datas abrupt resignation is now seeking a legal remedy for his woes captain louvois has requested my presence at those discussions

your response is emotional and irrational
irrational
you are endowing data with human characteristics because it looks human but it is not if it were a box on wheels i would not be facing this opposition
overt sentimentality is not one of captain picards failings trust me i know
i will tell you again data is a valued member of my crew he is an outstanding bridge officer
if i am permitted to make this experiment the horizons for human achievement become boundless consider every ship in starfleet with a data on board utilising its tremendous capabilities acting as our hands and eyes in dangerous situations
look youre preaching to the choir here why dont you get to the point
data must not be permitted to resign
data is a starfleet officer he still has certain rights
rights rights im sick to death of hearing about rights what about my right not to have my life work subverted by blind ignorance
we have rule of law in this federation you ca not simply seize people and experiment with them to prove your pet theories
thank you
now youre doing it data is an extraordinary piece of engineering but it is a machine if you permit it to resign it will destroy years of work in robotics starfleet does not have to allow the resignation
commander who do you think youre working for starfleet is not an organisation that ignores its own regulations when they become inconvenient whether you like it or not data does have rights
let me put it another way would you permit the computer of the enterprise to refuse a refit
thats an interesting point but the enterprise computer is property is data
of course
there may be law to support this position
then find it a ruling with such broad ranging implications must be supported phillipa i hope you will use the same zeal that you did in the stargazer court martial


data youre supposed to rip the wrapping off
with the application of a little care wes the paper can be utilised again
data youre missing the point

the dream of the fire by kratak thank you worf
it was in the hands of the klingons that the novel attained its full stature
i couldnt disagree more well save that argument for another day data excuse me please

is something wrong
of course there is youre going away
no one regrets that necessity more than myself you do understand my reasons
sure i understand i just dont like your being forced out its not fair
as doctor pulaski would at this juncture no doubt remind us life is rarely fair
sorry that just doesnt make it any better
i shall miss you geordi
yeah me too take care of yourself data


i have completed my research based on the acts of cumberland passed in the early twenty first century data is the property of starfleet he cannot resign and he cannot refuse to cooperate with commander maddox
what if i challenge this ruling
then i shall be required to hold a hearing
then i so challenge convene your hearing
captain that would be exceedingly difficult this is a new base i have no staff
but surely captain you have regulations to take care of such an eventuality
there are i can use serving officers as legal counsel you as the senior officer would defend
very good
and the unenviable task of prosecuting this case would fall on you commander as the next most senior officer of the defendants ship
i cant i wont datas my comrade we have served together i not only respect him i consider him my friend
when people of good conscience have an honest dispute we must still sometimes resort to this kind of adversarial system
you just want me to prove that data is a mere machine i cant do that because i dont believe it i happen to know better so im neither qualified nor willing youre going to have to find someone else
then i will rule summarily based upon my findings data is a toaster have him report to commander maddox immediately for experimental refit
i see i have no choice but to agree
good and i expect you to do your duty in that courtroom if i find for one minute that you are not doing your best i will end this then and there
you dont have to remind us of our duty you just remember yours
i have never forgotten it not then and certainly not now

come

data captain louvois has issued a ruling you are the property of starfleet command you can not resign
i see from limitless options i am reduced to none or rather one i can only hope that commander maddox is more capable than it would appear
data youre not going to submit were going to fight this i challenged the ruling captain louvois will be compelled to hold a hearing she may be overly attached to the letter of the law but i suspect that she still understands its spirit we will put to rest this question of your legal status once and for all now i have been asked to represent you but if there is some other officer with which you would feel more happy
captain i have complete confidence in your ability to represent my interests

working


this hearing convened on stardate  is to determine the legal status of the android known as data the office of the judge advocate general has rendered a finding of property the defence has challenged commander riker
your honour there is only one issue and one relevant piece of evidence i call lieutenant commander data

verify lieutenant commander data current assignment uss enterprise starfleet command decoration for valour and
your honour well stipulate to all of this
objection your honour i want this read all of it
sustained
valour and gallantry medal of honour with clusters legion of honour the star cross
proceed commander
commander what are you
an android
which is
websters twenty fourth century dictionary fifth edition defines an android as an automaton made to resemble a human being
automaton made by whom
sir
who built you commander
doctor noonien soong
and he was
the foremost authority in cybernetics
more basic than that what was he
human
thank you commander what is the capacity of your memory and how fast can you access information
i have an ultimate storage capacity of eight hundred quadrillion bits my total linear computational speed has been rated at sixty trillion operations per second
your honour i offer in evidence prosecutions exhibit a a rod of parsteel tensile strength forty kilobars commander would you bend that
objection there are many life forms possessed of mega strength these issues are not relevant to this hearing
im afraid i cant agree captain proceed with you demonstration commander

drawing on the log record of the construction of the prototype android lore also constructed by noonien soong i request to be allowed to remove the commanders hand for your inspection
objection  it doesnt matter objection withdrawn
proceed commander
im sorry

the commander is a physical representation of a dream an idea conceived of by the mind of a man its purpose is to serve human needs and interests its a collection of neural nets and heuristic algorithms its responses dictated by an elaborate software programme written by a man its hardware built by a man and now and now a man will shut it off

pinocchio is broken its strings have been cut

i request a recess
granted


do you mean his argument was that good
rikers presentation was devastating he almost convinced me
youve got the harder argument by his own admission data is a machine
thats true
youre worried about whats going to happen to him
ive had to send people on far more dangerous missions
then this should work out fine maddox could get lucky and create a whole army of datas all very valuable
oh yes no doubt
hes proved his value to you
in ways that i cannot even begin to calculate
and now hes about to be ruled the property of starfleet that should increase his value
in what way
well consider that in the history of many worlds there have always been disposable creatures they do the dirty work they do the work that no one else wants to do because its too difficult or to hazardous and an army of datas all disposable you dont have to think about their welfare you dont think about how they feel whole generations of disposable people
youre talking about slavery
i think thats a little harsh
i dont think thats a little harsh i think thats the truth but thats a truth we have obscured behind a comfortable easy euphemism property but thats not the issue at all is it

commander riker has dramatically demonstrated to this court that lieutenant commander data is a machine do we deny that no because it is not relevant we too are machines just machines of a different type commander riker has also reminded us that lieutenant commander data was created by a human do we deny that no again it is not relevant children are created from the building blocks of their parents dna are they property i call lieutenant commander data to the stand

what are these
my medals
why do you pack them what logical purpose do they serve
i do not know sir i suppose none i just wanted them is that vanity
and this

a gift from you sir
you value it
yes sir
why
it is a reminder of friendship and service

and this you have no other portraits of your fellow crew members why this person
i would prefer not to answer that question sir i gave my word
under the circumstances i dont think tasha would mind
she was special to me sir we were intimate

thank you commander i have no further questions for this witness
commander riker do you want to cross
i have no questions your honour
thank you you may step down
i call to the stand commander bruce maddox as a hostile witness
verify maddox bruce commander current assignment associate chair of robotics daystrom technological institute major papers
yes yes yes suffice it to say hes an expert commander is your contention that lieutenant commander data is not a sentient being and therefore not entitled to all the rights reserved for all life forms within this federation
data is not sentient no
commander would you enlighten us what is required for sentience
intelligence self awareness consciousness
prove to the court that i am sentient
this is absurd we all know youre sentient
so i am sentient but data is not
thats right
why why am i sentient
well you are self aware
ah thats the second of your criteria lets deal with the first intelligence is commander data intelligent
yes it has the ability to learn and understand and to cope with new situations
like this hearing
yes
what about self awareness what does that mean why am i self aware
because you are conscious of your existence and actions you are aware of yourself and your own ego
commander data what are you doing now
i am taking part in a legal hearing to determine my rights and status am i a person or property
and whats at stake
my right to choose perhaps my very life
my rights my status my right to choose my life it seems reasonably self aware to me commander im waiting
this is exceedingly difficult
do you like commander data
i dont know it well enough to like or dislike it
but you admire him
oh yes its an extraordinary piece of
engineering and programming yes you have said that commander you have devoted your life to the study of cybernetics in general
yes
and commander data in particular
yes
and now you propose to dismantle him
so that i can learn from it and construct more
how many more
as many as are needed hundreds thousands if necessary there is no limit
a single data and forgive me commander is a curiosity a wonder even but thousands of datas isnt that becoming a race and wont we be judged by how we treat that race now tell me commander what is data
i dont understand
what is he
a machine
is he are you sure
yes
you see hes met two of your three criteria for sentience so what if he meets the third consciousness in even the smallest degree what is he then i dont know do you  do you  do you well thats the question you have to answer your honour the courtroom is a crucible in it we burn away irrelevancies until we are left with a pure product the truth for all time now sooner or later this man or others like him will succeed in replicating commander data and the decision you reach here today will determine how we will regard this creation of our genius it will reveal the kind of a people we are what he is destined to be it will reach far beyond this courtroom and this one android it could significantly redefine the boundaries of personal liberty and freedom expanding them for some savagely curtailing them for others are you prepared to condemn him and all who come after him to servitude and slavery your honour starfleet was founded to seek out new life well there it sits waiting you wanted a chance to make law well here it is make a good one
it sits there looking at me and i dont know what it is this case has dealt with metaphysics with questions best left to saints and philosophers im neither competent nor qualified to answer those ive got to make a ruling to try to speak to the future is data a machine yes is he the property of starfleet no we have all been dancing around the basic issue does data have a soul i dont know that he has i dont know that i have but i have got to give him the freedom to explore that question himself it is the ruling of this court that lieutenant commander data has the freedom to choose

i formally refuse to undergo your procedure
i will cancel that transfer order
thank you and commander continue your work when you are ready i will still be here i find some of what you propose intriguing

hes remarkable
you didnt call him it

you see sometimes it does work
phillipa dinner
you buying

sir there is a celebration on the holodeck
i have no right to be there
because you failed in your task
no god no i came that close to winning data
yes sir
i almost cost you your life
is it not true that had you refused to prosecute captain louvois would have ruled summarily against me
yes
that action injured you and saved me i will not forget it
youre a wise man my friend
not yet sir but with your help i am learning
the dauphin


sir we are approaching klavdia three
take us to impulse power
 aye sir impulse power

bridge this is engineering
yes lieutenant
now that were out of warp id like to use this time to make some routine adjustments on the deuterium control conduit were overdue

how much time will these adjustments require lieutenant
a couple of hours sir
proceed lieutenant la forge standard orbit ensign

wes im going to need an scm model three from ships stores can you handle that
right away
all right


magnify mister worf hardly an inviting planet even for a research establishment
i would have thought the inhabitants of daled four would send a future leader to a more hospitable environment
for some security is more important than comfort
yes but sixteen years
captain were being hailed
hailing frequencies mister worf
open
this is captain picard of the uss enterprise
 i am anya of
sir the planets troposphere is distorting our signal
can you clean that up mister worf
ill try now
this is picard of the enterprise please will you repeat your message
i am anya have you come for salia of daled four
that is correct
what species are you
human
excellent bring us aboard that is all
friendly isnt she
friendly or not salia has the rank of head of state so we will treat her and anya accordingly number one mister worf lets go greet our visitors you have the bridge mister data
aye sir


welcome to the enterprise im captain picard
this is salia of daled four
i didnt feel a thing is that normal when one is transported captain
oh yes it is
those must be the matter energy conversion controls may i take a look
yes of course
i can arrange for a tour of the ship if youd like
oh id love that
no that will not be necessary just show us to our quarters captain picard
very well

were accommodating you in quarters normally reserved for starfleet admiralty im sure youll find them quite comfortable

thats a superconducting magnet isnt it
yes its an scm model how did you know that
study for the last sixteen years it is all i could
please salia walk ahead with me
better be careful those can rip the iron right out of your blood cells

commander who is she
i think shes a governess
no the girl
i dont know if shell have time for you wes shes destined to rule an entire world


come in
you wanted to see me
yes data the girl who came on board
salia of daled four
who is she
little is known she was born on daled four her parents were from opposite sides in a civil war which has lasted for centuries they both died shortly after her birth a federation ship brought her and her governess to klavdia three so that she could be raised in a neutral environment
and now shes returning
it is hoped she will unite the factions and bring peace
ensign crusher report are you all right
geordi yeah im fine i just
wes were waiting for that magnet
im on my way

captain weve broken orbit and laid in a course for daled four we will remain on impulse power until lieutenant la forge completes his adjustments
mister worf have our passengers accommodations met with their approval
i doubt if anything ever meets with that womans approval sir
captain im concerned our new passengers their emotions do not fit who they are and what theyre doing
are you suggesting theyre not who they say they are
actually no its more like theyre not what they say they are
picard to salias quarters
yes
may we turn on the viewer
yes of course
are your quarters satisfactory
yes very tell me captain who was the young man i met before

that was ensign wesley crusher

thank you for checking on us captain i only hope our quarters on daled four will be this luxurious
please feel free to contact me at any time picard out

what i sensed before hasnt changed
what puzzles me captain is how she is expected to bring peace to daled four its inhabitants have been fighting throughout their recorded history
what do we know about the cause of these wars
only that it is the difference between night and day
data you used a colloquialism
did i what i meant sir is that daled four rotates only once per revolution therefore one side is constantly dark and the other side constantly light one might surmise that the two hemispheres have developed disparate cultures which is a major cause of most wars
this child is supposed to bring them together
she seems too delicate for such a task
do not be fooled by her looks the body is just a shell


how can i be a leader if i dont know anything about my people
you will lead because you are accepted by both sides and because it is in your blood
what is expected of me once im there
you will know
how
you just will salia you must arrive with an open mind without preconceived ideas of the worlds you will find or the people on either side
its very frustrating
you feel the weight of so much responsibility youre not sure youll live up to everyones expectations
its not only that nobodys even asked me if this is something i want
it is your duty
and i have no choice
it wont be as bad as you think in fact it could be quite wonderful besides you are the last and only chance

dont you think im going to need more than instinct to do whatever is expected of me on daled four

energy depletion level
 point oh four percent and increasing
wesley wesley you havent found that defocused area yet

im looking
yeah i see the way youre looking wesley
what  sorry ive got my mind on something
i can see that
its this girl they beamed up geordi shes perfect absolutely perfect
now i understand why you cant concentrate
ill do better
okay
warning resonant field applied
what is it what happened
nothing i had it on the wrong setting
i suppose it had to happen to you it usually does at about this age
what usually does
glands erupting with hormones it happens to all of us
just because i said that i think shes interesting
you said she was perfect come on down youre no use around here for now come on down go talk to her use the ladder

thats silly geordi but since you recommended it how should i approach her if shell talk to me what should i say
just say hi im wesley crusher id like to talk to you
and then what
whatever occurs to you
what if nothing occurs to me
look wes i dont have time for this youre going to have to ask somebody else
okay


that is how the klingon lures a mate
are you telling me to go yell at salia
no men do not roar women roar then they hurl heavy objects and claw at you
what does the man do
he reads love poetry he ducks a lot
worf sounds like it works great for the klingons but i think i need to try something a little less dangerous
then go to her door beg like a human
it should be that simple wesley judging by her appearance it is likely you and salia are biologically compatible of course there could be a difference in the histocompatibility complex in the cell membrane but
data i want to meet her not dissect her

picard to salias quarters
yes captain
may i activate the viewer

hurry go go

certainly
 weve invited anya to take a tour of the ship maybe you would like to join her
very much
 your escort will with you shortly picard out
i think ill go on the tour

why cant i this is the only chance ill ever have to see a vessel like this

no you must remain here where it is safe salia do an old woman a favour and obey me for the rest of this trip
you are no more an old woman than i am a leader

yes come in
im here to escort you on a tour of the enterprise
salia will remain behind i will be right there you are a leader and i am older than you could ever imagine

what should i say how do i act what do i do
guinan i need your help could you step over here a minute
sounds simple enough

 now the first words out of your mouth are the most important you may want to start with something like this  you are the most beautiful woman in the galaxy but that might not work
yes yes it would
you dont know how long ive longed to tell you that
but you were afraid
yes
of me
of us of what we might become
commander
or that you might think that was a line
maybe i do think its a line
then you think im not sincere
i didnt say that theres nothing wrong with a line its like a knock at the door
then youre inviting me in
im not sending you away
thats more than i expected
is it as much as you hoped
to hope is to recognise the possibility i had only dreams
dreams can be dangerous
not these dreams i dream of a galaxy where your eyes are stars and the universe worships the night
careful putting me on a pedestal so high you may not be able to reach me
then ill learn how to fly you are the heart in my day and the soul in my night
i dont think this is my style
shut up kid tell me more about my eyes


this is the dilithium crystal chamber our chief engineer geordi la forge
what is that what are you doing
nothing to be concerned about just performing some routine adjustments
i wasnt aware that the deuterium control conduit required routine adjustments

i perform periodic inspections on all engineering systems
in this case you seem to have found a malfunction
its not a malfunction its simply that a minute defocused area has developed it lowers our operating efficiency
it could also lead to excess prion production
our computer would detect that
unless of course it too is malfunctioning
look i really have to get this finished
anya please come with me
i will be back to check your progress


ensign crusher what can i do for you
nothing

is there a problem
no
could you show me how to work the food dispenser
sure

really its quite simple you just tell the computer what you want and it prepares it for you
oh what should i order
i dont know what do you like
id like something sweet
i know computer thalian chocolate mousse

its a wonderful sensation
on thalos seven they age the beans four hundred years
youve been there
its one of my favourite places
it must be fun to visit a planet like that
its the best part of being on the enterprise
ive studied about some of them but to see them that would be wonderful tell me about some of the other places youve been
oh theres too many
the only world ive known is klavdia three
its about time we changed that
how
come with me


ill be with you in a moment
whats wrong with him
andronesian encephalitis
that disease is contagious
very unlikely our air filtering system can handle
but there is a chance
if you mean mathematically yes the probability is not zero
i cannot rely on your primitive technologies kill the patient
what
destroy the patient immediately
now you calm down
if you wont take action then i will

security to sickbay hurry

wait hold your fire

worf
what is she keep her away
do not interfere
she wants to kill hennesey
his disease threatens salia
captain there is no chance of contagion
the situation is under control
thats not good enough
well it will have to be
your powers are infinitesimal compared to mine
yes that may be but you will obey my orders you are to remain in your quarters and in your present form for the rest of this voyage is that clear
very
keep her under guard
aye sir

wait for me what kind of creature is she
ive never seen anything like her
there is mention in the galactic zoological catalogue of a species called allasomorph which is supposed to possess the power to alter their molecular structure into other life forms
such a creature would make a perfect protector
i want a security team stationed outside sickbay mister worf
aye sir captain what if anya transforms
improvise


can a place so remarkable truly exist
yes there are many more all of them are different
ive learned about them thats all i did on klavdia three was learn i know so much but ive seen so little
think of what you have to look forward to this is a great time to be alive
for you
for both of us this is all just beginning weve only charted nineteen percent of our galaxy the rest is out there just waiting look what weve already discovered
i have never seen anything so wondrous
wait computer rosseau five

its breathtaking
yes
and youve been to this place
someday youll visit rosseau five and many other places all more spectacular
if only it were possible
listen
what is it
in a moment the harmonic resonance from the neutrino clouds will become synchronous

its so beautiful its like this place has a voice and is trying to speak to us thank you for sharing all of this with me
someday youll see it all for yourself look over there


remain here you are restricted to these quarters for the remainder of this voyage
you are the protector of this ship are you not
i am in charge of security
you must understand my duties as well if you confine me to this cell i cannot protect salia
there is no need for concern she is safe on this ship
you must understand that i cannot make such an assumption
you no longer have the choice you have to trust me to protect her
no a true protector cannot have two charges your responsibility is to the ship my duty is to salia
my responsibility to the ship includes protecting salia
you know im stronger than you
i was unprepared
you underestimated me in your sickbay that is usually fatal
still you are here confined to your room
i ceased my struggle by choice not because of you or your captain
i would have stopped you if not me someone else
no you cannot control me
we will see

weve obviously brought a very dangerous life form aboard this ship i want to minimize the chances of any incident
whatever kind of life form anya is emotionally shes salias mother
the most dangerous animal is a mother protecting her young
exactly
captain this is anya
yes
salia is gone where is she

this has all been so wonderful im not even sure its real
believe me ten forward isnt an illusion
not that i mean the way i feel
you wont find a better dish of chocolate anywhere
im sure i wont
is something wrong
ive had a great time being with you wesley
and that makes you sad
when i was on klavdia three all i could think of was leaving that isolation what makes me sad is having to face it again after seeing what else is possible
is that what awaits you on daled four isolation
yes
i thought you were going there to reunite two warring parties
what else do you know
very little the ships computer doesnt have that much on daled four how will you stop the fighting
im not certain i only know i will have many responsibilities when i get there your language has no word for the position ill hold in many ways ill have even less freedom than i did on klavdia three
you could stay
on the enterprise
why not
because i cant

just because a girl runs out doesnt mean she doesnt wish you to follow

what is it what happened salia
stay away from me im sorry
i dont understand
i cant stay here i cant have this life i want it more than anything but i cant have it
salia nothing is impossible
not for you
theres a way i know there is

leave her alone
ensign step away from her
 come with me

energy depletion level
zero
la forge to bridge
yes lieutenant
ive just completed my final adjustments thanks for the time you now have warp engines available
very good

number one get us to daled as quickly as possible
ensign gibson take us to warp eight point eight
 warp eight point eight sir
estimated time
three hours nine minutes
ensign crusher when youre finished with your duties in engineering report to my ready room
yes sir
you have the bridge number one
aye sir

the woman anya is not what she appears to be she is an allasomorph
a shape shifter
yes shes not only a governess shes also the girls protector now i dont care to interfere in the personal relationships of those under my command but in this case
you want me to stay away from salia
yes i do for the good of the ship and the safety of everyone on board
i will do as you ask

why wont you let me have a friend
it is my duty to protect you from danger
theres no danger here
there is always danger from one who is not your kind salia hes confusing you youre forgetting you responsibilities
whether or not i see wesley is for me to decide
it is not i raised you i protected you and i intend to deliver you to daled four
maybe what you want doesnt matter any more
salia please i know its difficult for you but you must do what you are destined to do

standard orbit
aye sir
hailing frequencies mister worf
captain i am encountering the same interference we experienced on klavdia three
the troposphere appears to be distorting our signals it is fascinating captain klavdia three and daled four have almost identical atmospheres
magnify times twenty
how could anyone exist in an environment so totally hostile toward human life
mister data do whatever is necessary to override the interference lets complete our mission

come in salia you shouldnt have come
do you want me to leave
i didnt say that
then you want me to stay
does anya know youre here
that doesnt matter
im glad you came i thought anya would have kept you with her
i have certain rights
so in other words you slipped out
while she was asleep i hope you didnt get in trouble from your captain
oh i havent got in trouble yet
anya thought you would corrupt me
with my wild way of life
maybe with the normal things people do when they like each other

wesley get out of here now
whats going on
just go please
security crew quarters
no anya no

you should not have disobeyed me
i had to
i warned you to leave her alone
captains log stardate  since anyas powers of transformation apparently gave her the ability to escape her guards unnoticed we have sealed her quarters with a forcefield that will contain her no matter how small a form she may take

captain im receiving an audio signal
audio on
come in enterprise this is command headquarters of daled four we have been expecting you
sir sensors indicate the communication originated from a terawatt source on the planet
thats more power than our entire ship can generate
it is what is needed to penetrate the atmosphere
which means we lack the ability to respond sir
sir there are beamdown coordinates encoded within the carrier signal
splendid
ill arrange for our guests to beam down

forcefield off

come in
we have arrived
salia will be with you in just a moment

youre not going
no my duties have been completed i have done all that i could i hope it was enough
youve raised me well and i thank you for that
i would not have harmed the boy i only wanted to frighten him
i know
you are ready for what awaits you and you will do well i know that i have been hard on you but i wanted to prepare you for anything you might be required to do
will i ever be able to leave daled four
probably not but anything is possible
thats what wes said
i hope hes right
where will you go
the third moon is within range of this ships transporter i shall go there it was my home before we went away
im going to miss you
i know

i am ready now

i will escort you to transporter room six
you will be happy to see me leave
no you are a worthy opponent
thank you at heart we are very much alike
yes we are
perhaps we shall fight again on the same side
it would be an honour shall we go

come in
wesley i have to go now
was it fun
what do you mean
playing humanoid was it fun
wesley look at me right now this minute this is what i am a humanoid girl
what are you really
does it matter
yes
our natural state is one unlike anything you can imagine
so you took this form for our benefit thats why you wanted to know what species we are
im sorry i hurt you i didnt mean to
i loved you
i love you too
can you
yes oh yes i have the same feelings the same emotions as you you must believe me
please go
wesley lets not say goodbye like this


prepare to beam salia to the specified coordinates
aye sir
our world is grateful for the courtesy which you have extended us
i hope some day that the federation and daled four will have formal contact
that is my wish as well
coordinates have been input sir
proceed

wait a taste to remember me by
i wish there were something i could give you
you already have
im glad you came to say goodbye thank you for everything
i want you to leave now
why
i cannot arrive on my planet in this form and i want you to remember me as i am now
dont worry i will

energise


seeing her on the transporter pad it was like seeing pure light i miss her i feel empty
i know that sensation but therell come a time when all you remember is the love
im never going to feel this way about anyone else
youre right
i didnt expect you to say that
therell be others but every time you feel love itll will be different every time its different
knowing that doesnt make it any easier
its not supposed to
contagion

captains log stardate  in response to a desperate plea for aid by my old friend captain donald varley of the uss yamato i am running a grave risk by taking the enterprise into the neutral zone varleys request was prompted by dangerous malfunctions which have been plaguing our sister ship perhaps with both crews working together we can able to eliminate the problems before our presence is detected by the romulans

how long to rendezvous mister crusher
four minutes and thirty three seconds sir
status of download mister data
the yamato log should be in our computer by rendezvous sir
have you nailed down our little hiccup yet
sir
the odd reading
no sir it might be due to problems currently being experienced by the yamato
trouble number one
im not sure sir are we alone out here worf
yes sir there are no other vessels in the area except the yamato which is coming into visual range now
at last
transmission from the yamato sir
on viewer

donald whats a nice starfleet captain like you doing in a place like this
its good to see you again jeanluc despite your antique humour i only hope your people are able to help us malfunctions are becoming serious we lost an engineering team when the computer shut down a forcefield in an open shuttlebay eighteen people
do you have any idea what caused this sir
none they are affecting every system simultaneously its like the ship has suddenly decided to fall apart its beginning to make me think we should have run these galaxy class ships across a few more drawing boards before we built one
you believe its a design flaw
i dont know im grasping at straws here all i know is weve got to get it fixed and before i lose more than an engineering team
do you wish to evacuate any nonessential personnel to the enterprise sir
no no that would be premature
donald well get our teams to work on it immediately im sure neither of us feels too comfortable sitting around in the neutral zone
i know what youre thinking what the hell am i doing here well i had heard rumours about a couple of archaeological digs that started making the iconians sound a lot less like legend i did a little investigating and i located their homeworld
in the neutral zone
in the neutral zone
donald that was quite a risk to run to satisfy archaeological curiosity
the risk would be in allowing the romulans to locate iconia fortunately i got there first its a virtually dead planet but enough technology remains to give the romulans an edge if they should find it

donald your transmission is breaking up mister data try and clean that up
sir there is an energy buildup in the yamatos engineering section
yamato this is the enterprise yamato come in
captain magnetic seals in the antimatter chamber are decaying
captain donald come in

shields up

sir
sensors indicate no life readings sir
captain another vessel is coming within sensor range it is romulan
captains log supplemental the yamatos entire crew and their families more than a thousand people have been lost circumstances unfortunately permit us no pause for grief

no response from the romulan vessel
arm phasers and prepare to lock on target
did they attack the yamato
unknown sir
all their weapons systems have been fully activated still no response
romulan vessel this is captain jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise

captain picard
explain your illegal presence in the neutral zone
explain yours
are you responsible for the destruction of the yamato
no but believe me captain had we chosen to exercise our right to defend the neutral zone we would not have stopped with one starship you will leave at once
mute
comments
shes extremely anxious
understandable if she just destroyed a federation starship
your scan was inconclusive we dont know what happened to the yamato
our presence in the neutral zone is provocative it could force her to respond
open
we will comply when i have determined the cause of the destruction of the yamato and when i am fully satisfied that you were not responsible picard out
they are engaging their cloaking device
good they cant fire when theyre cloaked
unless they have overcome that deficiency the yamato was destroyed while they were cloaked
enough answers i want answers not conjecture number one i want them at a staff meeting in one hour
aye sir


sensor recordings reveal that what we witnessed was an uncontrolled and catastrophic matterantimatter mix the magnetic seals between the chambers collapsed and
wait wait thats not possible
yes sir it is but a highly improbable series of events has to take place for such a result to occur
explain
okay in the event of a breach of seal integrity theres an emergency release system which dumps the antimatter data apparently such a dump began was then halted and the containment seals were dropped there was still sufficient antimatter present to lead to an explosion
and so there is no evidence that a weapon was used
no sir none
however it happened the yamato did it to herself
theorise what could have caused such a catastrophic malfunction
i think captain varley may have been right there may be a design flaw
in a galaxy class starship
yes sir its the most sophisticated piece of machinery ever built something could have been overlooked
knowing where the flaw is located can you isolate the problem and solve it
were already working on it sir
pull any personnel you can use

if we have established that the romulans were not responsible for the destruction of the yamato would it not be prudent to withdraw
if it is a design flaw were better to stay where we are and give geordi time to work on it or what happened to the yamato could happen to us

computer access captain donald varleys personal log search parameter locate entries containing words romulan and or iconia
working
personal log it was kind of doctor ramsey to allow me to carry away my own little piece of legend from the archaeological dig at denius three my engineers have examined it but are completely baffled by its technology what was its purpose im like a caveman confronted by a tricorder im certain this device is iconian but how far had it travelled before it was abandoned on this alien world  personal log a galactic rosetta stone the starfields on the artefact were unintelligible until i took into account two hundred millennia of stellar drift after that it was easy to pinpoint iconia  my first officer is questioning the wisdom of my order to violate the neutral zone but i am convinced that i have taken the only proper course should this advanced technology fall into the hands of the romulans we might as well dock our ships and defend ourselves with sticks  personal log weve been spotted by a romulan cruiser but after playing hide and seek through several solar systems i think ive managed to elude them  the iconian probe scan was it an attempt at communication if only i knew what we were dealing with here  personal log im unable to send an away team to the surface of iconia nor can i scan the energy source on the planet because of these maddening system failures its infuriating to be stopped at the threshold of a dream by ones own ship were leaving orbit to rendezvous with picard if his people cant help us repair the yamato i must convince him to continue this exploration the future wellbeing of the federation may well depend upon it
no further entries conforming to search parameters



mister data theres a reference in captain varleys personal log to a probe that scanned the yamato
aye sir we have a visual record
put it on main viewer
what the devil is that

have you seen anything like that before
no sir it appears to be a scanner possibly a transmitter
transmitting what
unknown sir
engineering

la forge
what progress on the matterantimatter scan
everything continues to check out im starting an analysis on the magnetic coils

when the yamato was probed where was she
in orbit around a planet at coordinates two two seven mark three five nine sir
eta at warp factor eight
twelve hours sixteen minutes sir
sir that would put us substantially close to the romulan side of the neutral zone
that cant be helped ensign lay in a course warp factor eight
aye sir
were going to assume the yamatos mission
and risk a war
perhaps prevent one

come
sir may i speak with you for a minute
yes of course well what is it wesley
its about the iconians sir i was told they were just a myth
china was thought to be only a myth until marco polo travelled there no the iconians were certainly real sit down we know that three systems within this sector had a number of cultural similarities similarities which could only be explained by there being a single unifying influence
so they colonised those worlds
probably conquered
you mean they were warlike
perhaps ancient texts did speak of demons of air and darkness
air and darkness
legend has it that they travelled without the benefit of spaceships merely appearing out of thin air on distant planets
sounds like magic
well we would appear magical to stone age people
how did you find all this out
archaeology has been a hobby since academy days but why dont we talk about what really brought you here
its the yamato captain i cant stop thinking about her all those people dead i dont know how you and commander riker and geordi how you handle it so easily
easily oh no not easily we handle it because were trained to as you will be tea earl grey hot but if the time ever comes when the death of a single individual fails to move us 
didnt you order tea sir
now that should not have happened
captains log supplemental as happened with our sister ship the enterprise is being to experience a series of system failures so far they are random but i fear they could be early symptoms of what happened to the yamato

engineering
la forge
lieutenant

are you making any progress toward solving our problems
solving them no sir but i can eliminate one worry it is not a design flaw

ive been reviewing the yamatos log and i think maybe that alien probe had something to do with her problems
how
i need to see the thing

if it was the probe that explains the yamato but how do you account for the difficulties the enterprise is experiencing

i cant
lieutenant are our problems likely to attain the seriousness of those on the yamato
if youre asking for speculation id say yes sir they are i need time

mister la forge time is the one thing which we do not have in abundance

analysis mister data
scanning sir
well mister data
no lifeform readings sir
all major cities have been heavily damaged and the pattern of destruction is that consistent with largescale orbital bombardment
how long ago
approximately two hundred thousand years sir
there is an energy source in the mountains of the smaller continent
magnify
is that iconia
captain varley died believing that it was

did you see that
captain projectile launched from the planets surface
its size and composition match the probe which scanned the yamato sir
shields up prepare a tractor beam mister la forge im going to assist you in your research a probe has been launched from iconia

im going to capture it
no sir wait captain captain


coming through

bridge

emergency stop

stop damn it


tractor beam ready sir

geordi are you all right
destroy the probe sir quickly
worf target phasers
phasers locked on target
fire

welcome to the bridge mister la forge
thank you sir if that thing had managed to scan us we never would have had any chance of saving the enterprise

that probe was a transmitter sending an alien computer programme the same programme that is currently aboard the enterprise trying to rewrite our software in its own image we have two completely incompatible computer systems trying to interact
so thats why the ships instruments have become so erratic
yes
what can you do
not very much the iconian programme is so sophisticated i may never understand it
consider captain this programme has entered an alien data base ours and in less than seven hours has managed to not only learn our systems but has begun to reprogram our computer
and so the earlier probe was responsible for the yamatos destruction
yes but only in as much as it was the probe that transmitted the programme
but we werent scanned by that probe how did this thing get aboard the enterprise
we downloaded the yamato log and contained in the log was the programme
why didnt we suffered the same fate
the programme affected all of the yamatos systems simultaneously but with us it was deposited within a specific section of our mainframe so its having to work its way out from that location that gives us a little breathing space
not much the injury reports are increasing too sir
doctor pulaski is unwilling to trust the turbolifts she is sending medical teams through the access tunnels
captain the enterprise computer system is a lot like our own bodies with voluntary and involuntary system now probably ninety percent of what happens on this ship is done automatically completely out of our control were sitting on a bomb that could go off any second or maybe never


the biobeds arent working the ship is falling apart ive had thirtyfive emergency calls scattered across twelve decks my trauma teams are being run ragged trying to respond biobeds
doctor pulaski
yes
ive got a problem here the knitter isnt working
try a splint
doctor
splint its a very ancient concept you take two flat pieces of wood or plastic a bandage the broken limb is kept immobile
thats crazy thats not practicing medicine
oh yes it is its a time honoured way to practice medicine with your head and your heart and your hands so jump to it

damn
try a bypass on the shield control interface
no go let me see if i can directly access the master programme

data
yes
what happened
any answer would be mere speculation this is yet another example of how our actions have random results
thanks data i noticed

life support has failed on decks seven and thirteen sir now what if this thing manages to rewrite our entire system its so far beyond us that we dont have a hope of understanding it let alone controlling it our own ignorance could kill us
we may never reach that point a variation of what happened to the yamato might destroy us first
so we just sit here and watch our ship disintegrate around us
the probe was launched from iconia probably from an automated system there may be records near the launch site that could help us find a solution
ill arrange an away team
and ill lead it
you will lead it
yes
sir weve had this conversation a hundred times
and we will have it again number one i have been studying the iconians since i was a cadet i have to be the one to go the enterprise is yours

for as long as she lasts


ive got a fix on the energy source and for the moment this babys working but that could change in an instant
were aware of the risks energise
transport complete

stay sharp mister obrien i want to be able to pull them out of there at a moments notice
aye sir
commander romulan vessel

open hailing frequencies
 theyre arming photon torpedoes
shields up go to red alert
sir the shields arent responding
they are preparing to fire photon torpedoes
mister crusher i need those shields
im trying sir
theyre firing

what happened
instead of firing they suddenly disarmed and cancelled
fate protects fools little children and ships named enterprise lock phasers on the romulans and hold your fire
sir the shields are back up
impeccable timing
sir the shields are back down
phaser banks are down
shields are back up
in another time and place this could be funny
status of torpedo banks
theyre down too
in case it should become necessary to fight could you arrange to find me some rocks to throw at them
sir the romulan torpedoes are continuing to arm and disarm
maybe its attempt to fire was unintentional open hailing frequencies
open
romulan vessel this is commander william riker first officer of the uss enterprise why did you attempt to fire on us
this is subcommander taris of the haakona why have you penetrated deeper into the neutral zone
why are you still here
i have claimed this planet for the romulan empire
this is the neutral zone nobody can claim anything
you will withdraw or i will be forced to destroy your ship and your away team

what the hell
 this is your final warning i will not

having a little trouble with your systems commander maybe we could consider postponing the war until we solve our more immediate problem
youre stalling for time
sir another probe launched from the planet heading toward the romulans
have we got our phasers back
no sir
taris if youve got phaser capability prepare use them now
what
destroy that probe

and not even a thank you
subcommander taris is deeply frustrated probably because her ship is as crippled as the enterprise
why would the romulans be experiencing problems they werent probed
they must have tapped into the yamato log taris got a whole lot more than she bargained for maintain red alert try to keep those shields up in case taris decides to act on her threat
commander what about the away team with the shields up we cant beam them back
captains log supplemental while there is little left on the surface of iconia we have found what appears to be a control centre which seems to have remained intact


come in enterprise still no response sir
keep trying them communications are bound to be erratic
i would not like to become a permanent resident of this planet
nor would i mister worf
scanners show no other life forms on the planet sir
i would not expect any judging from the severity of bombardment i doubt any iconians survived well mister data lets see what sense we can make of this
aye sir
this is very reminiscent of dinasian
yes sir there are also similarities to dewan and iccobar
is it possible that they could be branches of the same language family beginning with iconian
it is sir
run a comparison using basic simple words from dinasian dewan and iccobar see if we can reconstruct a common root language
accessing sir


youre jumpy
the tension on the ship is very high
whats your recommendation
give everyone something to do somewhere to focus their attention
all right lets consider evacuation
to the planet
i know its probably impossible with taris sitting out there but it would give everyone something to do you go and organise it
but you might need me if you have to negotiate with taris again
ill manage right now theyre more important

captain your original hypothesis is correct iconian is the parent tongue of a language family which consists of iccobar dewan and dinasian i have constructed a basic working understanding through a comparison of common root words such as mother father child home tribe food life death yours ours mine
data data data
you do understand sir that my interpretation of the symbols will not be exact
yes lets get on with it
this would appear to be manual override

that was not manual override
demons of air and darkness indeed

what is that
a gateway
these scenes could be holographic images

be careful

data that was very foolish
but we have established that this is not a holograph if i step through and investigate we could determine whether it is truly a gateway
no data you might not be able to get back and i cant risk losing you
if it is not illusion this gate would seem to take us beyond the confines of this planet
is this how the iconians travelled crossing light years as easily as we would cross a room those places could be on worlds in distant sectors of the galaxy i think the iconians might have outfoxed their enemies maybe they didnt all die in the bombardment some of them could have passed through this this is what varley feared this is what he died for
sir
the romulans could use this technology as a weapon
like the iconians did
no i disagree captain there is nothing in this room to indicate it was used as a military command centre perhaps a transporter room
but the probe was hostile
we cant make that assumption the effect on the yamato was devastating but what if it was by accident not by design what im going to say may sound unscientific but standing on this soil breathing in this air my instincts tell me that we may have got them wrong
but we do know that the iconians were conquerors
but that knowledge was passed down by the descendants of those who attacked this world the victors invariably write the history to their own advantage there is an unfortunate tendency in many cultures to fear what they do not understand its possible that their enemies confronted with this technology were driven to attack the iconians out of fear

sir

was that really the enterprise
i believe that it was gentlemen we have a way home
captain there is a vast underground power source which is controlled by this console i believe my triggering of the gateway has caused a dramatic upsurge in power level ah i have access

data can you hear me data respond
captain
are you all right
no i am damaged
how bad is it
the iconian programme is attempting to rewrite my software physical manifestations blindness motor con
sir without him we have no hope of deciphering the programme captain the enterprise again
how long is the interval
about four minutes if the cycle holds
the next time the enterprise appears go through it with data geordi will be able to learn from him maybe help him
sir we have not yet established that that is truly a gateway
this will be the test
aye sir
destroy the tricorder
sir it contains everything weve discovered up to this point
and that is precisely why it must be destroyed how long
about three minutes
im running out of time we all are data data i have to destroy this this control room and its technology must not be allowed to fall into romulan hands
i understand sir
how how do i do it how do i destroy everything the control room the probes all of it

the power source sir
i detonate it but how how do i do that
the probes sir
probes the probes launch i launch the probes but why whats good will that do
the doors sir
doors
perhaps the probes are in a launch bay
and if the doors are closed then the backwash from the rockets will spill into the power grids and therell be an overload
yes sir
but the doors will open automatically when the launch begins and i will override
correct sir
which control keys damn of course you cant see
help
worf help him up
describe please
im standing directly in front of the gate to my left there is a small triangular screen
right one metre
right now to my right is a larger triangular screen the top is solid amber to the left red
correct key blue amber amber red
thats the launch sequence how do i override the doors
blue blue blue
i hope thats not a stutter i dont know how long a delay there will be between the launch and the detonation ill hold keying the launch sequence until youre through the gate how long until the enterprise reappears
almost time captain you will be killed
ill go through the gate
but where will you end up
very shortly anywhere will be preferable to this room mister worf i am depending on you you must get data back to the enterprise he may be their only hope
aye sir


commander look
worf what happened wheres the captain
we must take data to engineering hopefully the captain will follow

i dont know how to help him but comparing recorded norms for data to the current readings its clear that all his functions are just going crazy if we had an expert a maddox somebody i

hes gone


kandar qui kandar pro kandar kija kandar sis kandar exen


data
what the hell
i am accessing
the selfcorrecting mechanism
captain captain
its constantly kicking in to make minute adjustments in the positronic brain
i am on the enterprise how did i get here
he cleared the iconian programme from his own system how
iconia i was on iconia now i am on the enterprise
geordi this is critical how
okay give me a second to think there was an incompatible programme running through datas system so the mechanism started searching for a way to keep him alive the solution the solution was a shutdown and a total wipe of all affected memory
query what have i forgotten
can you do the same thing with the enterprise
i dont see why not but it will have to be a complete shutdown we turn her off and effect a wipe of the yamato log including every subsequent event since we downloaded it ill then be able to reload all the ships programs from the protected archives in the main core
geordi if we shut down that means were going to be bringing down the shields and were hanging nose to nose with a romulan battle cruiser
hey commander whether its romulan phasers or our own warp engines were just as dead
make it so
may i help


kandar nien kandar cobar

kandar konyen


all systems functioning
lock on the captain bring him back
scanning sir got him


kandar jet kandar se kandar tor kandar eir kandar




ive lost him
damn it
got him sir hes on the romulan ship
how the hell


go to your stations you did this you sabotaged my ship
oh no
i cannot deactivate the autodestruct but at least i have the satisfaction that you will die with us

not i think today commander

bridge picard
yes captain
take us out of here the romulan ship is set to autodestruct and they cant deactivate it
wait sir open hailing frequencies
open sir
commander taris prepare to receive a transmission from our chief engineer hell instruct you how to purge your system

agreed enterprise standing by
commander your transmission has been received

and acknowledged
now mister data warp speed please just in case tariss engineer is not as efficient as our mister la forge
aye sir
well number one i can see why you want to keep the away missions to yourself thats where the excitement is so whats been happening here same old routine i suppose
the royale

captains log stardate  were entering orbit around the eighth planet in this previously unmapped theta one sixteen solar system we diverted from our scheduled course when a passing klingon cruiser reported discovering pieces of a strange vessel in the upper atmosphere of this planet we have come to investigate

nasty nitrogen methane liquid neon surface temperature minus two hundred and ninety one degrees celsius winds up to three hundred and twelve metres per second
not exactly a vacation planet eh
not unless you like ammonia tornadoes but i have found indications of debris in an elliptical orbit
keep me informed the sooner we find out what the klingons think they saw the sooner we can get the hell out of here
sounds good to me nasty

come

fermats last theorem youre familiar with it
vaguely i spent too many math classes daydreaming about being on a starship
when pierre de fermat died they found this equation scrawled in the margin of his notes x to the nth plus y to the nth equals z to the nth where n is greater than  which he said had no solution in whole numbers but he also added this phrase remarkable proof
yeah thats starting to come back to me there was no proof included
for the eight hundred years people have been trying to solve it
including you
i find it stimulating also it puts things in perspective in our arrogance we feel we are so advanced and yet we cannot unravel a simple knot tied by a parttime french mathematician working alone without a computer
captain weve detected some sort of debris in a loose orbit
can you identify it
no sir i suggest we beam a section aboard for analysis
make it so number one

weve locked onto something with markings on it
what sort of markings
uncertain energise

weve got ourselves a puzzle number one
yes sir i think we have

analysis bears out that the object was definitely terrestrial in origin dated mid twenty first century
no no no earth ship of that time could have travelled out this far
nevertheless that is what our tests indicate and the markings we discovered are consistent with this hypothesis
any indication of what destroyed it data
that is even more significant than the object itself counsellor on several of its surfaces the molecules seem to have disintegrated
disintegrated how
almost as if they were hit by a weapon from our time
curiouser and curiouser

alices adventures in wonderland
 if you needed reminding
captain weve detected a large structure on the planet

its a building of some sort situated on a plain of frozen methane smack in the middle of a tremendous storm belt
i dont believe this that structure is surrounded by breathable air
is there any connection between that structure and the ship fragment we found
unknown sir
suggestions
just one sir we could go down there and have a look
breathable air no life forms that might be dangerous i think we could risk a minimal away team number one


give me a moment gents were dealing with an extremely narrow access point
phasers on stun ready when you are
i believe weve got it now you have a green light commander
energise


those ammonia storms are less than a kilometre away yet they do not appear to penetrate this breathable zone
its like the eye of a hurricane
commander what is that

a door
the structure must be here yet we cannot see it
enterprise this is commander riker

as your read out shows this is an unusual place

completely calm no sound no movement yet a few hundred metres away a storm is raging
any information about the structure
yes sir there is an antique revolving door it could be an entrance

a revolving door number one proceed with caution
yes sir

well this is what we came here for captain were entering



enterprise to away team come in
were receiving no signal at all from them sir
transporter room lock on to the landing party beam them up
weve got nothing to lock on to sir

riker to enterprise weve entered the structure riker to enterprise come in come in enterprise

when they went through that antique doorway the signal just disappeared sir
whats causing the interference
unknown
are they receiving us
no were going to have to recalibrate all the frequencies to find one thatll work
then do it

sir without communication we should beam up immediately
were here theres no danger well look around then leave
checking in gentlemen youll have to go to the front desk
very good well start with that
welcome gentlemen have a nice trip
do you know us
weve been expecting you a trio of foreign gentlemen
yes were from the united federation of planets
of course you are welcome to the hotel royale
excuse me did rita call
im busy
youre busy this is my life im talking about here now did rita call or not
no and for your own good youd better quit thinking about rita
im not afraid of mickey d
then youre a fool anybody with any sense is afraid of mickey d
if rita calls you let me know

kids just asking for trouble ritas too much for him to handle and mickey ds going to plant his face in the pavement now here are your room keys and some complimentary casino chips enjoy
what is this place how did a being like you get here
why this is the royale of course and my personal life is really none of your business thank you
what he means is what planet is this
i beg your pardon
this planet what do you call it
earth what do you call it
we call it theta eight
how charming

commander
yes data
none of these people are emitting life signs
you mean theyre not alive
then what are they
these beings are they machines or mere illusions designed to deceive us
not illusion lieutenant they do exist but they do not register as either man or machine
take this creature for example he does not exhibit any dna structure
excuse me son look whos talking man you sound just like my exwife all right time to get back to business
what sort of business do you suppose he is getting down to

status report
were attempting to employ alternate encoding schemes
there could be hundreds of possible combinations
is there an intelligence causing this interference
thats impossible to tell captain
its unlike commander riker not to follow procedure when he lost contact with the enterprise he should have returned immediately to the beam down coordinates
i dont feel hes in any danger in fact if i could choose one word to assess his mood it would be amused
amused


put some chips there mister yes sirree youre new around here arent you
yes sir
sit down im going to teach you how this game is played boy go ahead ante up

he wants you to cut the cards
ah is this poker
no no blackjack
blackjack accessing ah also known as twenty one a number which defines the object of the game picture cards are worth ten aces one or eleven all other cards face value
boy youre right you are right

pretty smooth run em boy make em nice and friendly
twenty one twenty one
dont look at your hand honey that gal has got to win now honey you got fifteen and the dealers showing ten
do i hit texas or do i stand
if youve got to win youve got to hit
hit me  damn
shoot hit me twenty one and a winner yes sirree
hit me another please
do you think youve had about enough
if the objective of the game is to approach a total of twenty one points i will definitely need another card
yeah
boy you have got the brass do you know what the odds are on a five card charlie hell youre just throwing your money away
hit me

howd you shut my mouth hey youre not one of them card counting fellas are you
the number of the cards and their values remain quite constant what would be the purpose in counting them
yeah
having fun data
fun sir while there is a certain amount of enjoyment involved i am mainly conducting research into
save it were getting out of here
understood sir
guys youre holding up the game
our apologies sir
ill watch your chips
thank you sir
hey the hat
sorry sir
deal them up

progress
weve accessed the range of encoding scheme alternates the difficulty is in the frequency range the interference is highly variable
see the problem may be with the envelope covering the structure there are hydrogencarbon helix patterns throughout
any transmissions are simply scattered and refracted at random no wonder you cant get through
exactly
those are some fairly aggressive computations lieutenant
im comparing the molecular integrity of that bubble against our phasers
is penetration possible
i dont know just yet it may be an option id like to run this test
make it so


lets try that again

lets find another way out of here

excuse me excuse me aside from the main door is there another exit i might use

excuse me
excuse me say i was wondering if you could tell me

theres a good deal of structural integrity worf
permission to use phaser sir
granted

sir i can find no other exits i believe we are trapped here
captains log supplemental we remain in orbit around theta eight still out of contact with the away team

were almost there captain well be able to attempt contact in a few minutes
captain the situation down there has changed
in what way
commander riker has become tense closed in hes feeling trapped

phasers are totally ineffective on all surfaces
sir our options appear quite limited
we dont have any if were going to get out of here were going to have to do it on our own im going to get some answers out of that desk clerk


are you crazy
wrong im finally getting some smarts
you think youre going to scare mickey d with that gun
im going to make him leave rita alone
kid shes a big girl and shes mickey ds girl
not any more not after tonight
look kid i like you i dont want to see you get hurt especially over some dame
dont call her that youll see youll see how tough mickey d is hes nothing
i want some answers
im sure the concierge will be delighted
we would like to get out of here now
the royales exits are clearly marked
thats not good enough
if you have a complaint about the service youve received during your stay here you can always take it up with the manager
fine id like to see him immediately
im afraid the manager is very busy

 riker can you read me
yes

theres a good deal of interference but you are getting through
number one why havent you left that building

we tried sir it seems like were trapped here were in no immediate danger

but i am concerned
something about your location is interfering with communication we are working on the problem
standing by sir
captain these frequencies are unstable
then find others
yes sir
what is going on down there

commander i am picking up something most unusual in another section of this structure it appears to be human dna
where
thirty one point nine metres above and to the right of us
perhaps those turbolifts could take us there

seems to be malfunctioning


the reading i received is from behind this door sir


my reading is intensifying sir
are you getting any life signs
none sir

definitely human male
looks like the poor devil died in his sleep
what a terrible way to die
he has been dead for two hundred and eighty three years sir the lack of any advanced decomposition is due to the sterile environment

why would anyone go to all this trouble its just window dressing for a dead man
commander
is this significant sir

american
fifty two stars sir places it between  and  ad it correlates with the debris we found colonel s richey rest in peace colonel
picard to riker
finally riker go ahead

youre coming through clearly now
whats your situation

this structure was apparently made to resemble twentieth century earth all efforts to exit have failed
we havent found a way to transport you back yet
i assumed as much sir weve also located the remains of a human request identity scan colonel richey american first initial s roughly the same time period

do it

commander some curiosities
books a novel hotel royale summarise please

information retrieved captain
number one
go ahead captain
we have the information you requested colonel stephen richey was the commanding officer of the explorer ship charybdis

which had a terrestrial launch date of july rd  it was the third manned attempt to travel beyond the confines of the earths solar system

its telemetry failed it was never heard from again do you believe that youve discovered the remains of colonel richey
yes and captain

weve found something else a novel by todd matthews entitled hotel royale which is the name of this structure data
captain this is the story of a group of compulsive gamblers caught up in a web of crime corruption and deceit

it is told by nefarious lothario mickey d who appears only at the climax to carry out the coldblooded murder of the hotel bellboy

there is also a subplot about an older man conspiring with a younger woman to murder her husband she is squandering her inheritance
captain this novel and everything data just described

seems to be exactly whats happening at this hotel
extraordinary
theres also one other thing a diary with only

obviously made by colonel richey
can you read it
yes i write this in the hope that it will someday be read by human eyes i can only surmise at this point but apparently our exploratory shuttle was contaminated by an alien life form which infected and killed all personnel except myself

i awakened to find myself here in the royale hotel precisely as described in the novel i found in my room

and for the last thirty eight years i have survived here i have come to understand that the alien contaminators created this place for me out of some sense of guilt presuming that the novel we had on board the shuttle about the hotel royale was in fact a guide to our preferred lifestyle and social habits obviously they thought this was the world from which i came

i hold no malice toward my benefactors they could not possibly know the hell they have put me through

for it was such a badly written book filled with endless clich and shallow characters i shall welcome death when it comes

i understand number one now we know why all that is there

why cant you get out

number one
yes sir
lieutenant la forge has a thought he believes we can phaser a slice in the field

surrounding the structure
that means the atmosphere of the planet would instantly rush in
our projected survival would be approximately twelve seconds

correct the cryogenic process would be nearly instantaneous
but i assume you could revive us
yes

in theory
you must understand number one

well wait here for months if necessary were just considering options
if youre trying to motivate us to find

our own way out of here youve succeeded captain

yes there is a female voice asking if we want room service
i believe she is asking if we want the room cleaned
tell her no
no
what did she say
she said the kitchen will be open twenty four hours if we change our minds
were going to explore the rest of the hotel well keep a comm line open you two go down to the lobby and see if theres anything that weve missed you talk to the guests and try to find out who or what they are ill check out the rest of the floors

computer locate and display the text of the novel entitled hotel royale by todd matthews
accessing
if the cause of the difficulties is in the novel we may find the solution within its pages ah  
it was a dark and stormy night
 its not a promising beginning
it may get better

i suggest we separate and blend in with these beings casual queries offered inconspicuously may prove fruitful

i need a four give me a four
oh shoot
how much do i have left here
honey now you know its bad luck to count your chips at the table
yeah
excuse me sir might i inquire where are you from
lubbock texas
and how did you get here
to vegas drove my car i got a ninety one caddy with only eighty thousand miles on it
where is your automobile now
out front i suppose what the hell difference does it make
could you take me there
hit me im losing my shirt
son why would i want to do that cant you see im trying to to help this little lady
i believe you are trapped inside the royale just as i am
sure does seem that way when youre losing dont it were just trying to turn this ladys wagon around and win back some lost change otherwise shes in a desperate situation and shes got nowhere to turn well almost nowhere
i stay right 
i wouldnt
the odds favour standing pat
what do i do
do you want a card or what
hit me  too many ive almost lost it all what am i going to do
there there there there there

what did you find
nothing
rita just called
she did what did she say
it was kind of hard to tell she was crying
crying damn mickey d thinks he can treat people any way he wants well thats all over now

you were told
its not for you to make the call its for rita
she sent me to tell you
okay boys look we cant afford to have any trouble in here why dont you just take this outside
yeah i like that come on baggage man


lets you and me take it outside
when i was a kid i used to look up to you guys the suit the fancy shoes i really thought that made you somebody but youre nobody she could make something out of her life

i dont believe this dialogue did humans really talk like that
not in real life remember everything thats going on down there is taken from what colonel richey calls a secondrate novel
like rita she could do something with her life she could be somebody if she only had the chance
with your permission sir

she is somebody shes my girl
you got her on the stuff thats the only reason she stays with you because you feed her sickness

you got to let me help her
well why dont we just go outside and talk about it
just watch yourself
dont worry
its all part of the novel dont interfere

you should have listened to me kid no womans worth dying for killing for not dying for

riker to enterprise

yes number one
a bizarre incident just took place
the shootout between the bellboy and mickey d

yes and mickey d just walked out the door how did he do that

its on page 

in the novel right how does it end

a bad love affair ends in a bloody shootout the hotel gets bought out and life goes on such as it is

the hotel gets bought by whom

it isnt specific it simply refers to foreign investors sale price twelve point five million united states

they return home leaving the assistant manager in charge
captain thats how were getting out were buying this place

it is all a question of probabilities quite simple really if one bets with any sequential consistency
elaborate
the combinations totalling seven or eleven have considerable value when achieved on the primary attempt with eight variations possible to create those totals the likelihood of those totals occurring is not significant however
okay okay can you do it
i believe so sir

eights a point eighter from decatur candy see the wise do it do it

oh snake eyes
single digits on each cube are not at all desirable
youre almost broke
relax honey its only money
yeah but if you lose it all i wont even have a place to sleep
dont worry your little head honey id never let that happen go babe lets go here they come babe

seven youre out
youre turn slick
go to work
maybe this turkeyll bring us some luck

six six is your number
hell my blind grandmother can make a six come on boy roll em
i thought seven and eleven had value
actually six is a valid point of course now the objective is to roll a duplicate six before hitting seven
but the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven
there is a certain degree of random fortune involved i believe that is why they call it gambling
yeah
seven seven away next shooter
so much for your new turkey
give slick another shot i got a feeling about you boy
commander these cubes are improperly balanced i believe their final resting position would be
can you repair them
i believe so i will make another attempt

baby needs a new pair of shoes
eleven attaboy do that a few more times and were all gonna get well
seven a winner
and another one keep going boy we got a hot one lets go lets go

double em up here we go
keep em rolling boy keep rolling seven a winner

status number one

rather a nice run of luck captain
dont get out of character commander
sir

the foreign investors in the book are described as flamboyantly generous

yes sir i understand

seven look at that
oh tex darlin youre brilliant
yeah and im good lookin too huh
isnt that enough
no dont want to come up short you are keeping count
yes sir twelve point three million perhaps i will bet seven hundred thousand
no bet it all
but sir the sale price of this edifice is twelve point five million
we need some spreading around money data
sir
bet it all
there you go a little something for you ziggy a little something for those cocktail waitresses why dont you run this outside give it to the parking lot attendants
youre very kind sir
here you go vanessa a little something for you too
thank you
when the train comes in everybody rides
yeah and im getting off at this station after eighteen passes the air gets a little too thin for this country boy im betting against you fella
are you nuts
i do not believe that is a prudent choice sir
hey thats what horse racings about roll em boy
seven a winner
the man has the touch
you knew you were going to throw that seven didnt you you just let me go down the tube
i tried to caution you sir
what was it i mean was it personal or what because i didnt show you my car
now
i wish to cash in sir
im afraid youve broken the bank
just take twelve point five million the purchase price of this hotel spread the rest around
youre the foreign investors
thats right we just bought this place lock stock and barrel consider it a done deal
i like you fellas you got style let me buy you guys a drink
just enjoy the game dont let them change the dice on you
you got it

enterprise this is the away team were clear of the structure

three to beam up
time to come home now number one transporter room we have a fix on the away team beam them up

come

sir
welcome back number one
very strange experience puzzling i still cant comprehend how colonel richeys vessel could have travelled out that far not on its own at any rate
perhaps they were brought here by whoever created that makebelieve world down there its possible they didnt know how fragile the humans aboard actually were only one of them survived
none of it makes any sense
like fermats theorem its a puzzle we may never solve
note  it was proved by british mathematician andrew wiles read about it
here

time squared



come on in

excellent exactly what i need ah mister worf and the good doctor bearing gifts
ale from ennan six your omelettes deserve no less
this is not an efficient method for the preparation of sustenance
no youre right data the ships computer would be more efficient but it wouldnt allow for the subtlety needed for great cooking it would give you all of the ingredients in predetermined measurements but wouldnt allow for flair or individuality and data as we both know flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence
for much of the history of mankind the breaking of bread was a symbol of friendship and community something we have gotten away from in the twentyfourth century

ah you have a practiced hand commander
yes i have my father to thank
your father liked to cook
no he hated it thats why he left the chore to me
it is my understanding that in most human families the woman shares in the cooking
there were only the two of us i never knew my mother she died when i was very young
where did you get these eggs
on our last stop
at starbase seventy three
yes
what kind of eggs did you say these were
owon for you data something special dont be afraid they wont bite you and for you mister worf

a cooks only as good as his ingredients

delicious
number one
go ahead
i would appreciate you joining me on the bridge
right away sir

number one weve picked up an automated signal from a federation shuttlecraft
a shuttlecraft hows that possible i thought we were the only manned federation vessel out here
apparently not
whats a shuttlecraft doing out this far wheres its mother ship
sensors indicate there is at least one life form on board the shuttle sir humanoid
perhaps someone to answer your questions number one open hailing frequencies
communication is not possible sir the shuttle is without power
set course to intercept
estimate intercept in three minutes
captains log stardate  while en route to the endicor system we have encountered a federation shuttlecraft which seems to have appeared out of nowhere there are no indications of where it came from or how it got out here

we are closing on shuttlecraft sir
thank you lieutenant on screen
magnify

prepare to lock on tractor beam
target vehicle we will be within tractor beam range in two seconds
set automatic locking device alert shuttlebay two

shuttlebay two prepare for retrieval procedure

locking tractor beam

number one
youre with me mister worf
doctor pulaski you are needed in shuttlebay two
ive been monitoring im on my way


engage secondary tractor beam

its a federation shuttlecraft all right
yet there are no federation bases or vessels in this area
ncc one seven zero one d uss enterprise shuttlecraft five

ncc one seven zero one d uss enterprise shuttlecraft five
how is this possible
commander come here

captain
yes number one
are you on the bridge
where else would i be
well right now i think you should be in shuttlebay two

why what is it
this i think you should see for yourself bring commander data


condition
the life signs are very confusing his heartbeat is strong but the pulse is off
is he injured
theres no signs of trauma
why is he unconscious what happened to him
i cant say the readings of his brain waves are very strange
strange in what way nonhuman artificial
no neither theyre just out of phase
can you revive him
i wouldnt even attempt it till we get him into sickbay come on lets get him back

counsellor
i have never felt anything quite like this before so its difficult to put into words that person is you
no
he is as much jeanluc picard as the person i am standing next to beyond that there is very little i can be sure of i will have to wait until he regains consciousness before knowing more
data i need to know whats on the shuttles logs
yes sir

captain both primary and reserve power has been drained from the shuttle i am going to have to connect to the enterprise in order to activate the shuttles systems
geordi

report to shuttlebay two immediately
im on my way

ill be in sickbay keep me informed
captain seen this
looks like the damage caused by an antimatter explosion
it must have been just out of range of the shuttlecraft
data i need those logs counsellor
well be on the bridge lieutenant


resume course and speed scanners at maximum range
maximum range

there you go you should have power now

what happened
the polarity is not compatible
thats not possible the connections idiot proof
the power requirements of the shuttle do not match those of the enterprise we will need a variable phase inverter to align the power from the enterprise to the circuits of the shuttle
data what do you think is going on here i dont mean just with the shuttle i mean everything
i do not have enough information


im just starting a complete medical workup his vital signs are distorted some of the indicators are totally depressed others are fluctuating wildly i cant explain any of it but he is alive the restraints are for his own protection
have you been able to determine why hes still unconscious
no but i have been able to rule out any head injury
wake him

what happened
apparently the normal stimulant had the opposite effect ill have to try something else

all right data i think ive got it now that ought to give you something making this power adjustment is very tricky by all rights this connection should blow all the shuttles circuits
perhaps you had better step out of the way
all right but remember youre not indestructible yourself you know
increase the power
powering up
adjust the invert two percent positive
two percent positive its the right decision but its having the opposite effect
yes
i dont understand i cant think of anything that would cause the circuit to change so radically
adjust the invert two percent negative
okay two percent negative thats it it shouldnt work but it does hey data take a look at the stardate  captain
go ahead
captain weve been able to reactivate the shuttle and the onboard clock indicates that the shuttle is

six hours in front of us captain do you read me if the shuttles from six hours into the future then so is the other captain picard
captains log supplemental part of the mystery has been solved the reason there are two number five shuttlecrafts is because one of them is from the future six hours to be exact and so presumably is the facsimile of me

try to wake him again

no
its a only a sedative
i know what it is dont sedate him let him be please let him to remain conscious
i have never seen anything like this are you all right
im fine doctor save your ministrations for your patient i want a staff meeting in five minutes doctor i assume you will want to remain here
yes i will monitor the conference from here
keep me informed of any changes no matter how small
captains log supplemental ive been informed that mister data has recovered the logs from the duplicate shuttlecraft i am more than apprehensive to play back a log which will not be recorded for several hours

captain weve retrieved all we are going to get from the shuttle logs including the last visual records everything before that is just a jumble
show me
the distortion is because we had to use a phase inverter to retrieve the logs the quality will improve slightly

according to the shuttle log the enterprise was destroyed three hours nineteen minutes from now
captain we have a portion of the last log entry its audio only
captains personal log supplemental i have just witnessed the total destruction of the uss enterprise with a loss of all hands save one me
all attempts to obtain further information from the shuttle have failed
well at least now we have something to go on
i just dont understand how you could have ended up in a shuttlecraft while the enterprise was being destroyed
nor i the last thing you would do is leave the bridge of the enterprise during an emergency
yes all right lets proceed on the premise that what we have just seen happened and that in less than four hours from now the enterprise will be destroyed and somehow although this is unfathomable i and i alone escape discussion
our destination is the endicor system were due to arrive in three days the charts show nothing of consequence certainly nothing to threaten the enterprise between here and there
sensors indicated no other vessels federation or otherwise in this area
data
i have nothing to offer there is not enough information upon which to base a hypothesis
well the shuttle apparently came from somewhere up ahead so rather than continuing on this course maybe we should stop here and let whatever is out there come to us
we may already be too late
what are you saying that stopping turning right or left or even reversing our course would be pointless
when we brought the shuttle and the other picard on board we committed to a sequence of events which may be unalterable
yes this is not a rock on the trail which once seen can easily be avoided this is much more complex
there is the theory of the moebius a twist in the fabric of space where time becomes a loop from which there is no escape
so when we reach that point whatever happened will happen again the enterprise will be destroyed the other picard will be sent back to meet with us and we do it all over again sounds like someones idea of hell to me
well i know this much we cant avoid the future
agreed so lets continue on course somewhere out there something will happen a decision will be made during the course of which i will be separated from the enterprise at the time the decision will seem to be correct but it wont be we have to anticipate and not make not make the same mistake once something is waiting for us out there lets try and determine what it is as quickly as possible

doctor
im just beginning to realise just how much of the body is held together by its own internal clock he was thrown out of time which caused his body systems to change their rhythm now slowly as we get closer to the time he left his internal body clock is realigning
youre saying that when our time intersects with the time he left in that instant he will function normally and and there will be two of us
right now that is my guess
doctor i dont think thats possible
im able to feel much more from him now captain his emotions are still a jumble but
counsellor
he desperately wants to leave this ship
captains log supplemental we continue on course to endicor we are now less than two hours away from our rendezvous with ourselves

worf
maximum scan nothing unusual to report
if this timetable is correct we could get an indication of something very soon
bridge this is sickbay
yes doctor

captain my patient is more coherent

im on my way you have the bridge number one


how is he
his vital signs are more normal which is to say more like ours he is calmer
hes aware of me
perhaps in some fashion
but he knows where he is whos here with him
i doubt it
what went wrong you know dont you what did you do what happened why did you leave the ship dont turn away look at me picard look at me
captain he doesnt understand you
he knows im here
yes but in a nightmare of disjointed images and halfheard voices hes in another dimension looking at us across a great chasm and hes feeling remorse at what he has witnessed hes afraid
what is he afraid of damn you help me why did you leave the ship
its no use captain he cant answer you
when we get closer to his time he may be able to
are you still convinced hes me
yes but youre not convinced
not in the slightest except for his features there is nothing about him that i find familiar counsellor i want you to stay with him he will be able to communicate with you before any on else

i dont know how long anyone could take this kind of anxiety state there has to be a breaking point
i think hes handling it very well
he has a lot of anger
yes because of what he represents
and what is that
doubt hes afraid that seeing him here and knowing what happened to the enterprise will make him timid or worse make him to hesitate
part of my job is to anticipate problems my duty is to the captain but first to the ship and its crew
doctor the captain is quite capable of command decisions
yes for now but this situation has put him under extreme pressure of a unique and very personal kind we both know that pressure will only increase you said yourself that he already has doubt
which is understandable and healthy
and could be potentially paralysing if we begin to see signs that hes acting in an irrational manner i have the authority and the duty to relieve him
i dont think that will be necessary
i hope youre right


what force or phenomenon could cause the shuttle to be thrown back in time
none that weve encountered in theory accelerating beyond warp ten
using the gravitational pull of a star to slingshot back in time is that what happened here
the shuttle doesnt have warp capability
no so some external force was needed
weve never encountered a natural force that powerful why only six hours why not a day or a year
are you saying there was some conscious mind at work here
theres no evidence either way
the traveller moved through time using the power of his mind
i dont think thats the case here
no and manheims experiments with gravity and time were rudimentary and uncontrollable
captain i think this is one instance where you should suppress your natural tendencies
oh really
one of your strengths is your ability to evaluate the dynamics of a situation and then take a definitive preemptive step take charge now youre frustrated because you not only cant see the solution you cant even define the problem
go on
what were facing is neither a person nor a place at least not yet its time
youre saying i should just sit down shut up and wait
i wouldnt have put it exactly like that
not something i do easily
your persian flaw
yes perhaps it is

captain to the bridge

report
this energy vortex has just appeared beneath us there was no warning

well at least the waitings over
captains log supplemental we have apparently intersected with something

it is similar to our tractor beam sir only much more powerful
bridge this is lieutenant la forge
bridge

the pull on the enterprise is steady im having to hold the warp engines at thirty percent in order to maintain our present position

transfer engine control to the bridge
on my way captain
captain there is a consciousness here not thought more like instinct
what do you think number one
i think were being probed
the beam is coming from the centre of the vortex sensors show it to be only a mass of energy
what is it trying to learn
i think its trying to determine if we are a life force
well stay and investigate
agreed
unless that was the mistake staying too long
possibly
we should go now
well
that would be the prudent move i never thought id hear myself saying something like that
under the circumstances sir i think youre right
but you would rather stay and find out what it is what is its intent
engineering transfer to bridge
mister la forge
sir
try and take us out of here maximum warp
aye sir ive set the velocity at warp nine
engage
warp engines are at ninety one percent
put it to the wall mister la forge
aye sir

i cant hold it
captain the engines cant handle the strain
all stop

mister la forge
im reengaging warp engines captain
status
all decks have reported no damage no injuries
captain the hold on the enterprise is still very strong im having to hold at warp seven just to maintain our position
everything we do tightens its grip lets see what we can learn launch a class one probe
aye sir

mister worf

that was personal
captain the power drain needed to hold this position is enormous
how long can you maintain it
just a few minutes and then were going to have to shut down again
captain some kind of energy

just surrounded my patient
is he still alive
yes

arm the photons mister worf lock on the centre of the vortex
photon torpedoes locked on target
hold for my order

like a rag in a dogs mouth
i am now at maximum warp
its you captain it was the entire ship but now it has focused its attention entirely on you
captain i cant hold it any longer if we dont shut down right now we are going
hold this position counsellor if i were to leave the enterprise would its attention still be focused on me
yes i think it would
youd never survive
but in those few seconds the enterprise might break free thats what he thats what the other picard must have thought
captain where are you going
you have the bridge number one
youre leaving the ship
we may be on a road that has no turns


hes very agitated
i must get to the shuttle
i know do you know where you are
the enterprise
yes but youre only vaguely aware of it and me do you know who i am no you dont do you
i must go
release him
do you know what you are doing
no release him
security to sickbay
no security disregard that order and clear all personnel repeat all personnel from shuttlebay two

i dont want any distractions you stay here

you made a decision to leave the ship
i must
why
the energy in the vortex wants me
youre certain
yes its an entity a life form which recognises the enterprise as an entity with me as its brain and it wants me

shuttlebay two
whats your other option
this is our only chance if i leave it may be distracted long enough for the enterprise to escape
youre wrong if you leave the enterprise will be destroyed dont you remember you saw it happen
if i dont leave the ship then the enterprise will be destroyed

if thats true then help me we want the same thing we both want the enterprise to be safe but there is a piece of information i dont have what is it
its me
you
captain
yes
we are about to lose warp drive
understood
understood

when you say it wants you do you mean its still you only you and not me
youre confusing me were almost out of time i must get to the shuttle
wait you can ill let you but first tell me what is what was your other choice
stand aside
you must tell me what was it you dont know what im talking about youre locked into a single intent unable to change unable to alter any part of your previous actions
i have to leave theres no other way
there must be
one but it would never work
what is it what would never work
i have to leave
what was the other choice we cant fight we cant escape we cant go forward
no no we cant go forward that would destroy the enterprise
was that it is that the other choice
i must leave
no  captain picard i can not allow you to leave before we can go forward the cycle must end

doctor pulaski report to shuttlebay two

bridge


number one were wasting our energy trying to escape it only weakens us helm set a course for the center of the vortex mister la forge on my command i want all the power you can muster
yes sir
were going in
yes
course set sir
now everyone hold their position no matter what engage
 ibi
captain picard

this is shuttlebay two the other picard and the shuttle are gone
explain
they just vanished

whats our position
we are back on course to endicor
stand down from red alert
all decks have reported in no damage no casualties
you have the bridge number one

a lot of questions number one damn few answers
maybe none of it was real perhaps we were all part of a shared illusion
or maybe he was thrown back in time so that we would be able to take another road make a different choice well they say if you travel far enough you will eventually meet yourself having experienced that number one its not something i would care to repeat
ill be on the bridge sir
the icarus factor

captains log stardate  we are en route to starbase montgomery for engineering consultations prompted by minor readout anomalies

i would consider them insignificant
what if youre wrong sorry but what if it is more than a mere discrepancy
then id say we have a problem
agreed well have starbase montgomery give us an independent reading
even if the molecular level controls have failed we can still recrystallise the dilithium without outside help
dont worry data my ego isnt at stake here
perhaps we can reprogram the system to correct the readout variables
well thats certainly another option but as were stopping at starbase montgomery anyway well let them do the analysis
i dont recall starbase montgomery on the mission itinerary
i think we could all use a twelve hour layover besides ive just received some personnel transfer directives priority matter
boarding or disembarking
captain picard were within hailing range of starbase montgomery
go to half impulse power  will you join me in the observation lounge when youre done

captain
number one ive just been recollecting the arrival of a new first officer on board the enterprise and a manual docking confidently achieved i may have been somewhat miserly in my congratulations then so let me make up for it now the captain of the starship ares is retiring congratulations youve been selected as his replacement
the ares shes in vegaomicron sector
and they have picked up indications of an intelligent life form though nothing confirmed
obviously starfleet will want to know more
thats why theyre asking for you not for your military proficiency but for your skill as an explorer and as a diplomat
vegaomicron itll take months at high warp just to get there
with no guarantee of finding anything when you arrive well you have twelve hours to think it over and if its not too premature congratulations captain

establish synchronous orbit
aye sir
starbase montgomery is sending a civilian advisor on board to brief you on the aress mission
a personal briefing
a strategic attach with specialised knowledge in the frontier regions i think youll find the briefing interesting
i hope its complete much of my decision will be based on it
commander riker to transporter room three
enjoy

ensign
ah youre right on time commander hes on his way now

dad youre the civilian advisor the strategic attach
i asked captain picard to keep it quiet i didnt want you to make you nervous or excited
its been fifteen years excitement is hardly the appropriate emotion
youve done well first officer on the enterprise quite a feather in your cap
ive worked hard
of course im proud of you son
if youll excuse me ive got my duties to attend to when youve settled in we can complete our briefing have security arrange an escort for this gentleman
aye sir

worf did you hear about commander rikers promotion
yes
he didnt know his father was coming he was completely surprised
so
can you imagine if it was your father
i never knew my father
and i didnt have a father long enough to know him
it is a waste of time to think of such things
i wasnt thinking about it but everybody needs somebody
enough


you know starbase montgomery really didnt have to send me all this help because weve already checked the entire dilithium spectrum for anomalous frequencies so you dont have to waste your time on that

wes are you okay
i was just talking to worf hes really eccentric at times
thats one word for it
he was really upset i mustve said something wrong
maybe worfs not too thrilled with the idea of losing commander riker to a new assignment i know im not
neither am i but with worf it was something else somethings really bothering him
think so


female
no
career career
family
that is trouble you choose your enemies you choose your friends but family thats in the stars
so ive heard

kyle riker excuse me ladies great to see you
kyle been a long time
this is more than a surprise its total shock
you mean you didnt bake me a cake
youre actually here
that makes two of us how about a drink
how about a kiss

they know each other
no kidding i know her too but we dont do that

you look wonderful

and it has nothing to do with commander rikers new assignment
no his reaction was just the opposite of mine completely unaffected
you see with all thats going on maybe youre overreacting
really you try talking to worf geordi im telling you he is not normal for worf
there is of course a genetic predisposition toward hostility among all klingons but worf has been unusually out of sorts
come on hes never been much on charm
well whatever is troubling him i think we should try to help he is our friend
i for one want to keep him friendly
suggestions
empirical study monitor the subject
right watch the subject for any signs of unusual behaviour
that wont be difficult
within the norm of klingon patterns of course discretion will be required
agreed when do we start
we will assist you as needed you found the problem
and you must solve it


thank you and after working out the fuurinkazan battle strategies at the tokyo base i was asked to come here to work for starfleet as a tactical advisor
im surprised you stayed our of the action as long as you did will please join us your father and i are just catching up
you never told me you knew him
well it wasnt exactly a secret it just never really came up
sit down son
im ready for that briefing whenever you are

good to see you too graham
you wouldnt be running for mayor would you
do pick up work for the federation long enough and itll happen to you too i thought about you a lot
kyle i dont need to hear what you dont need to say
we couldve been great together
possibly
is it true you got married
again and again
that make you three for three doesnt it
im not complaining each was good a man and were all still good friends
like us
close but different they were all a little more in touch with themselves
ouch
face facts kyle youre crusty you have a reputation for being hard as nails and getting the job done underneath it all youre not so bad some of us even love you and then theres will
then theres will

wesley should really be doing this on his own
but he needs his study time
i cant believe you fell for that i dont know data he looks perfectly normal to me
in solitude there is nothing to trigger unusual behaviour
good point lets not tamper with the status quo
but that would defeat the opportunity for our behavioural research in all probability he is simply lonely we can relieve his anxiety through socialisation
be my guest

excuse me lieutenant you seem to have lost the will to communicate with others you have friends here we we care about you why just recently geordi wesley and i were saying
with all due respect be gone sir

he seems quite sincere in his desire for solitude
seeing is believing huh

come in worf
may i have a moment sir
of course what is it
it is very difficult to say words are not always easy for me is that earth

yes alaska i was nine years old
that is a fish you are holding
and i didnt even catch it
but it looks like you were
i hooked it my father took the rod away he wouldnt let me reel it in he was afraid that i might lose it
you do not have good feelings for your father
no i im not sure what im feeling whats on your mind
you plan to leave the enterprise
ive been offered my own command
i would like to join you
i havent accepted the assignment yet
but sir it could be a dangerous mission there may be the potential for combat
that is not the purpose of the mission
still to die a true hero
worf youve made your point
then i know you will do the right thing

finally were alone maybe now we can talk
im here for the briefing sir
all you need to know is here

these mission details could have been transmitted
ive been hearing some good things about you
then why havent i heard from you
i know keeping in touch is not my strong suit its a funny thing about being a parent there arent any tech manuals no quick readouts to get you to the next set of variables you just got to wing it from day to day will when your mother died
excuse me ive got to study this mission briefing
will i came to the enterprise because look considering where you might be going i wanted to im here with my hand out son

poor guy picked up a flu virus on our last stop at nasreldine
sounds nasty whats the therapy
tryptophanlysine distillates with generous doses of pcs
pcs
pulaskis chicken soup
you havent lost your touch havent you
i like to help when they hurt i hurt
commander pulaskis greatest medical skill is her empathy you must be commander rikers father
yes but how
weve all heard about you and i felt certain things
this is deanna troi ships counsellor
kyle riker
i thought you two should meet deannas job is to keep us from deluding ourselves
let me guess betazoid
at your service
i have some lab work to do if youll excuse me


why do i get the feeling that this is a setup
because you are intelligent wise and quite correct
well ive never been set up better thats for sure
youre also very anxious about something its will isnt it youre not as close to him as youd like to be
oh i dont know we both have pretty good taste in women wouldnt you say
id like to help you if i can if youll let me
fine what is it you want from me i came here to bury the hatchet with my son only to find out the ground was frozen solid
you dont seem to be the kind of man to give up so easily
i didnt say i was giving up it would just be nice to get a little something from him
what is it you want from him
i dont know acknowledgement maybe or
respect is earned not bestowed
respect i dont need that from him
perhaps you want him to be proud of you you carry great pride in his accomplishments
absolutely look at him first officer of the enterprise just been offered his first command
yet you covet his success
please hed be lucky to have the career ive had
true youre well respected in your field
i may have something of a reputation for excellence
and false humility
my guess is that will finds you pretty fascinating candour seems to be a trait he admires
honesty is the trait he admires most and you should honestly consider why youre so competitive with your own son
competitive maybe in the past but ive come here to help will prepare for his first task as captain
are you sure hell accept such a dangerous assignment
hell accept it just because it is dangerous
how can you be so sure
because i would and we arent so different will and i

youve seen your mission briefing
yes i have
any questions
no other than a question about the aress first officer
oh yes his name is flaherty
yes the briefing mentions something about an uncanny linguistic skill
that is an understatement number one the last time i saw commander flaherty he spoke forty languages as i recall among the more exotic were romulan klingon giamon stroyerian
he speaks forty languages
he has this unique ability of instantaneously interpreting and extrapolating any verbal communication that he hears you will find him very useful in sector vegaomicron
yes im sure i will

come in
oh captain picard at last id like to thank you for all the help youve been to my son
my only regret is that your reunion marks wills farewell
but hes ready for this command
oh yes i have no doubt
captain may i have a word with my son
yes of course excuse me gentlemen

i wont be pushed into this decision
oh come on will dont you think youre ready for the ares
starfleet does
of course because youre the best candidate for the job i only want you to know im here if you need me
ive been on my own since i was fifteen i can take care of myself
please spare me the pain of your childhood i hung in for thirteen years if that wasnt enough its just too bad

data what if i missed something
the ships computer would have corrected immediately
maybe my inputs were incorrect
data geordi i figured out worfs problem
you spoke to him
no no i accessed the complete klingon cultural database it took me some time
okay wesley slow down what is the problem
its the tenth anniversary of worfs age of ascension
his what
the klingon age of ascension its a ritual of great significance a rite of initiation marking a new level of klingon spiritual attainment
and what is the significance of the anniversary of this event
its a day of celebration and ritual spent with ones fellow klingons worf doesnt have any klingon friends
were his friends
right but we dont practice klingon tradition and were not klingons worf is feeling culturally and socially isolated
so what do you suggest we do im not sure id like to invite a bunch of klingons on board
we can programme the ships computer to supply simulations on the holodeck
holographic klingons sure why not
we need only to programme the computer with details of the specific ceremony
the cultural database said the klingons family must attend
so were his family well go i just wonder what kind of party the klingons had in mind

have you got a minute
sure
i wanted to apologize for my remark in ten forward your personal is none of my business
even if it involves your father
even if it involves my father
did he ever tell you why he never remarried
what woman would have him with an ego like that
i would have in a cold minute twelve years ago kyle riker was a civilian strategist advising starfleet in its conflict with the tholians the starbase that he was operating from was attacked none of the base crew was expected to live and they all died all except your father your father alone had the will to endure to face the pain to live
i never knew any of that about him
ive never saw a man fight so hard in all my life
and you fell in love
yes and so did he but marriage was out of the question he had other priorities
his career
you know if i were you going out on the ares id jettison the emotional baggage youre still carrying around

now the klingon cultural database was very specific on the setting
now let me guess twenty piece orchestra magnificent ballroom everybody in formal wear
no there is some unusual test of inner strength involved
that would entail the use of klingon painstiks
painstiks sounds lovely
enduring physical suffering is considered a klingon spiritual test
you mean in order for worf to celebrate the anniversary of his ascension he has to be hurt and we have to witness this
we are his family

come

number one
id be a fool to turn that promotion down wouldnt i
i dont know and if youre asking me what i think you should do i dont know that either i can spell out for you albeit crudely what you are choosing between as the first officer of the enterprise you have a position of distinction prestige even glamour of a sort you are the second in command of starfleets flagship but still second in command your promotion will transfer you to a relatively insignificant ship in an obscure corner of the galaxy but it will be your ship and being who you are it will soon be vibrant with your authority your style your vision you know there really is no substitute for holding the reins
ill need a little more time to make this decision

find anything yet
not yet
there is nothing to find
no harm in checking i guess
really how would you like them to give the transporter operation a little onceover
no problem were totally shipshape
youre missing the point its just the idea that they even suspect a malfunction
if i were not a consummate professional and an android i would find this entire procedure insulting
thanks data

chief will you be able to attend a little party for lieutenant worf at seventeen hundred hours
a party for worf sounds intriguing id be delighted
its a surprise
my lips are sealed

i didnt want to leave without saying goodbye
i dont like goodbyes how about until next time
how about until next time
its been a pleasure serving with you commander
the feeling is mutual counsellor
im supposed to know how everyone feels but i cant read you right now
perhaps your own feelings are getting in the way
my job is to help others sort out their emotions my own feelings are beside the point
not to me our feelings are what make us all human
are you feeling sad
yes i am
so am i


im leaving at twenty one hundred hours can i have a minute

ive practised my best academy courtesy now its time for you to go
its time for us to have a talk so lower your shields
im asking you to leave or ill
youll what you know its a shame theres no anbojyutsu ring nearby
really there is deck twelve the gymnasium
we can clear the air once and for all
youre on

scuttlebutt says you wanted to see me
thats right i thought i knew you kyle
you do as well as anyone
then what is this i hear about an anbojyutsu match with will
youve heard
havent we grown beyond the point where we resolve our problems with physical conflict
i think youre overreacting
im overreacting youre the one whos going out to fight with his own son
dont think of it as a fight kate think of it as more of a contest
and suppose one of you is injured
i know where to find a good doctor kate
kyle
will and i have been playing anbojyutsu ever since he was eight old and he knows how to handle himself and so do i
dont take this personally but will is in his prime
and im no spring chicken i know dont worry hes never been able to beat me


computer is this it
correct klingon rite of ascension chamber
is this really necessary
if we want to get worf through his problem it is
computer please give us klingon personnel appropriate to this event

these images are specifically programmed for ascension rites
cute bunch
and they use those
those are klingon painstiks i once saw one of them used against a twoton rectyne monopod poor creature jumped five metres at the slightest touch it finally died from excessive cephalic pressures
you mean
thats right the animals head exploded like
i think thats enough chief obrien

i do not enjoy riddles counsellor
you will enjoy this one
i am in no mood for trifling or games not today
i know what an important day this is for you the anniversary of your rite of ascension
you know about that
all your friends on board do
that is impossible it is a secret known only to klingons
and certain resourceful young ensigns
wesley crusher what does he know about it
just bear with me
where are we going
the holodeck
this is truly trying my patience counsellor
i think you will approve
youre not coming in
no
open

an ascension ceremony
happy anniversary worf
shall we begin
i am ready

dahjaj suvwie jih tigwij saangnis iw biqtiqdaq jijah today i am a warrior i must show you my heart i travel the river of blood

the true test of klingon strength is to admit ones most profound feelings while under extreme duress
jibechrup may vilos

the battle is mine i crave only the blood of the enemy hihivqa

the bile of the vanquished flows over my hands maypequ moh

thank you

is lieutenant worf all right
hes never been happier
so it was a good ceremony
lets just say that i was not about to stay for refreshments
klingon culture is not in your taste
im just glad that humans have progressed beyond the need for barbaric display
have they commander riker and his father are in the gymnasium about to engage in barbarism of their own
dont remind me its something of which i do not approve
in spite of human evolution there are still some traits that are endemic to gender
you think that theyre going to knock each others brains out because theyre men
human males are unique fathers continue to regard their sons as children even into adulthood and sons continue to chafe against what they perceive as their fathers expectations of them
its almost as if they never really grow up at all isnt it
perhaps thats part of their charm and why we find them so attractive
particularly men like commander riker
and his father
i hope they dont hurt each other

anbojyutsu the ultimate evolution if the martial arts

i remember my early lessons
you could never get used to the sightless factor or to losing
true but ive had fifteen years to practise
well lets see if youve learned anything

onegaishimasu

well youve been practising
and remembering you should have been the one to die not her yoroshikuonegaishimasu
good get it all out yoroshikuonegaishimasu

matta  i had you
listen will you were too young to understand and i was too hurt to explain
you were never too hurt for anything
she was your mother but she was my wife and when she died all that kept me going was you
you had a strange way of showing it
i came here thinking we could talk this out but maybe youre right maybe i am no father and youre no son and this this fight is all we have left

wait
what is it now
you cant do that
what
hachidan kiritsu its illegal
youre kidding
all those years thats why i never won you were cheating
it worked didnt it kept you coming back for more
incredible you cheated me howd you get away with it
you were just a kid by the time you were twelve years old i knew i couldnt take you but i had to keep you interested i had to keep you challenged didnt i
i always hated you for that
damn it will you were barely out of diapers when she died you hardly knew her id loved her of course you carried the pain so did i i should have explained this to you a long time ago but it hurt too much then the wall grew up between us and living there you and me the wall got bigger you know its funny i can talk to a whole roomful of admirals about anything in the galaxy but i cant talk to you about how i feel
how do you feel
how do you think i love you son ive got to get back to the starbase
i know im glad you came

be careful now okay

starbase montgomerys briefing specialist and analytical team have beamed down sir
ah what were the analytical teams findings
they suggested we reprogram the system to correct the readout variables
precisely what data recommended as i recall at least it gave commander riker the opportunity to consider his promotion now that hes accepted we can leave him at starbase montgomery

number one
captain with your permission ive decided to stay on board the enterprise
granted
thank you sir take us out of orbit ensign crusher
breaking synchronous orbit sir
set course for beta kupsic that is still our destination velocity warp factor five
course and speed set sir
any particular reason for this change of heart
motivated selfinterest right now the best place for me to be is here
engage
pen pals

captains log stardate  we are the first manned vessel to enter the selcundi drema sector unmanned probes have recorded unusual levels of geological activity in all five planetary systems i am hoping the enterprise will find the answer to this enigma

commander ive been reviewing the unmanned probe scans at some point during the last one hundred and fifty years the fifth planet of selcundi drema has shattered forming an asteroid belt
id call that geological instability
is there any indication that this is the work of an unknown intelligence
this is geology not malevolence these planets live fast and die hard the question is why

youre sure you wont reconsider
no ill just watch you and be impressed
an optimistic vote of confidence from a nonrider
you know i never particularly thought of you as an animal person
small animals no but horses computer programme the holodeck for a woodland setting with a bridle path and an appropriate mount
type of mount andorian zabathu klingon sark
horse earth horse
breed
arabian the arabs believed that allah gathered the south wind and made the horse
on the holodeck weve made that legend come true
i like that oh yes computer english tack and i will control the animal myself
enter when ready


so you like horses for the romance
it goes deeper than that a fine war mare would sleep in a bedouins tent carry him into battle feed his children with her milk theres a bond which is created by mutual need hello beautiful
now i understand you dont want the comfort of a pet you want a companion

thank you i dont want to anthropomorphise anything i seems that some creatures have the capacity to fill spaces you never knew were empty
i had a betazoid kitten once my mother and the cat reacted badly to one another
sure you dont want to try its very relaxing we can find you something that will be quiet and gentle
no i prefer a mode of transportation that doesnt have a mind of its own
strange i would expect betazoids to be outstanding animal trainers
we become too involved in the thoughts and shifting passions of the beast we lose our way and get swept up in emotion
i should think the shifting passions of this beast would be far more terrifying

captain
yes number one

weve entered the first system i think you might want to come to the bridge

something interesting
spectacular and a little terrifying
im on my way

the first long range reading magnification ten to the sixth
quite impressive

and deadly the last unmanned probe showed a thriving ecosystem now theres nothing

this is commander rikers meeting
ill need your advice and recommendations as you know ive been given the responsibility of overseeing wesleys education to further that goal i would like to put him in charge of the planetary mineral surveys
its a big job with a lot of responsibility
the game isnt big enough unless it scares you a little
to do the job wesleys going to need a team it takes command presence to lead do you think hes ready for that
leadership grows from selfconfidence which is also part of a starfleet officers education
all of this is true but there is an old horse trainers adage about putting too much weight on a young back we dont want him to break under pressure
we seem to be shifting the focus here are we talking about a young officer on the fast track to the academy or are we talking about a young man that we are guiding through adolescence and into adulthood
you cant guide someone into adulthood the experiences are unique to each person whether wes succeeds or fails he will learn from the experience
i agree im just questioning the speed at which were moving
you think were pushing him too hard
i think thats a valid concern
tempering is taken to extremes
he is a boy not a sword
who will one day be a man and to extend the metaphor will need a fine edge that wont dull at the first touch of resistance
sooner or later hell have to feel the burden of command ensign crusher

report to the observation lounge


wesley ive assigned you the command of the planetary mineral surveys
sir thank you sir
you may not thank me once you see how much work it entails assemble a team and take a look at the records on the drema quadrant theres a mystery here weve got to solve it
yes sir a team sir
ensign this is a serious responsibility
i know sir
these officers are here to assist you not judge help you you should make use of them they are a valuable resource and by the way i respect an officer who is prepared to admit ignorance and ask a question rather than one who out of pride will blunder blindly forward
i understand sir
ensign youre dismissed
ill try not to disappoint you


is this part of your regular duties
no it is a personal project i have reset the sensors to scan for frequencies outside their usual range
such as
the dips and peaks of the galaxys magnetic field organic molecules in nebular clouds energetic cosmic rays
interesting would these scans also detect artificial transmissions as well as naturally occurring signals
of course
good
those signals are very faint and difficult to distinguish from background noise that is why i am boosting the power

i will be removing that equipment to my quarters
good

hi can i walk with you
yes
i need a little advice
well its free
walking or advice
both
its about my team im considering so many factors im confusing myself
what have you done so far
well ive broken down the task and picked the best people in those disciplines
so who have you got so far
ive got prixus in mineralogy and metallurgy alans and hildebrandt for volcanology and geomechanics i want davies for geochemistry but
but theyre all much older than you are
right and it makes me feel strange what do i do about personality conflicts
completely irrelevant these people are professionals if theres a personality conflict youre in charge you settle it
so you not only have to understand the job you also have to be a ships counsellor
sometimes
well thank you
captains log stardate  we are entering the second selcundi star system where acting ensign crusher will begin his planetary mineral survey the results of which may help unlock the geological puzzle


ensign davies
you got him
wesley crusher ive been put in charge of the planetary geological surveys and id like to have you on the team
sounds great who else is on it
i have prixus and alans and hildebrandt
its a shame you didnt talk to me first its just personal opinion but i like to break up married teams
i hadnt thought of that
dont worry theyll probably work out fine and if you need any help just give me a signal and ill take over for you we dont want you to get too beat up on your first command
thanks but im pretty sure ill be all right

computer identify please
sensors indicate lowlevel rf waves
is there a pattern
affirmative
naturally occurring
negative
key universal translator please
unable to comply weak signal
lock on comm link and boost
lock on complete
read please
insufficient signal strength
enhance please
is anybody out there
yes


wes
hi doctor pulaski
you have trouble behind that door
my teams in there ive got to assign planets set a schedule
it sounds like youve got everything under control
i havent had to deal with them yet not together not professionally
wes the minute you walk through that door theyre your team you have nothing to prove youve got the authority
thats just cos commander riker says i do
its up to you to hang on to it now youd better get in there and wes for whatever its worth i think youre going to do just fine
captains log stardate  it has been six weeks since our entrance into the selcundi drema sector each system has revealed the same disturbing geological upheavals on every planet

 it seems to be at this point we can expect the greatest tectonic stresses
i agree nice job
here are the results of my scan on the third selcundi system its just the same old song
didnt you tell me that uv absorptions like these are indicative of traker deposits
and where theres traker theres generally dilithium yes i did
so dont you think we ought to run an icospectrogram
well wes these traker readings are really faint its probably just a fools echo
i think id still run an icogram
wesley its a major undertaking to set up the scanner
were looking at five hours minimum
i know i know i dont want to do a half way job
wes theres being thorough and then theres wasting time its also the mark of a good officer to recognise the difference
maybe youre right

computer please access all volcanic and tectonic plate activity in drema four
accessing
computer locate captain picard
captain picard is on holodeck three


data
an excellent steed sir sorry to disturb you captain
its quite all right it must be important or you wouldnt be here
yes sir it is important very eight weeks ago i received a transmission a simple four word message is anybody out there i answered it
there is a loneliness inherent in that whisper from the darkness
yes sir i am glad that you understand sir
but it didnt end there
no sir we speak often it is a young female humanoid
her society is aware that there is interstellar life
no sir
oops just where does she think youre calling from
i have kept that somewhat vague sir but sarjenka that is her name has been quite specific telling me details of her family and friends and interspersed among these confidences have been some alarming references
go on
drema four has been enduring the same geological stresses we have found in the other systems
then your friend is in trouble
yes sir
what are you proposing
if we can determine the cause of these geological disturbances we might be able to reverse the process
violate the prime directive
i was hoping that you might have another option sir
we dont even know if this catastrophe is preventable call a conference in my quarters all senior staff
yes sir
and data all communication with this life form must cease
yes sir i understand sir


seeing the look on his face ill get you another drink  two more

thank you

family emergency  you dont look like a person who came here to relax
i didnt i need your advice yesterday when ensign davies turned in his geological survey i asked him to run an icospectrogram he didnt agree
do you think you were right
yes i guess i could have just been picking nits
or you could have been intimidated its tough to tell other people what to do
i suppose i could have made it an order but how do you give orders to somebody older and more experienced then you
the difference in ages between you and davies is not the issue here
i guess not
do you think it might have something to do with ego
no its just the opposite of ego every time i try to give an order something inside me says what makes my judgment so superior to these peoples
wes responsibility and authority go hand in hand i know youre responsible now weve got to teach you a little bit of authority one of the reasons youve been given command is so you can make a few right decisions that will establish a pattern of success and help build selfconfidence if you dont trust your own judgment you dont belong in the command chair
but what if im wrong
then youre wrong its arrogant to think youll never make a mistake
but what if its something really important i mean not just a mineral survey what if someone dies because i made a mistake
in your position its important to ask yourself one question what would picard do
hed listen to everyones opinion then make his own decision but hes captain picard
well it doesnt matter once picard makes his decision does anyone question it
no way
and why not
im not sure
commander riker report to the captains quarters
when you figure it out youll understand command im on my way i hope ive been able to help you let me know what you decide
ive made my decision im going to have davies run that icogram thank you sir
youre welcome  ill see you later
okay


ensign davies i want that icospectrogram run on the selcundi drema system
you got it

it is no longer a matter of how wrong data was or why he did it the dilemma exists we have to discuss the options and please talk freely
there are no options the prime directive is not a matter of degrees it is an absolute
i have a problem with that kind of rigidity it seems callous and even a little cowardly
doctor im sure that is not what the lieutenant meant but in a situation like this we have to be cautious what we do today may profoundly affect upon the future if we could see every possible outcome
wed be gods which were not if there is a cosmic plan is it not the height of hubris to think that we can or should interfere
so what are you saying that the dremans are fated to die
i think thats an option we should be considering
consider it considered and rejected
if there is a cosmic plan are we not a part of it our presence at this place at this moment in time could be a part of that fate
right and it could be part of that plan that we interfere
well that eliminates the possibility of fate
but commander the dremans are not a subject for philosophical debate they are a people
so we make an exception in the deaths of millions
yes
and is it the same situation if its an epidemic and not a geological calamity
absolutely
how about a war if generations of conflict is killing millions do we interfere ah well now were all a little less secure in our moral certitude and what if its not just killings if an oppressive government is enslaving millions you see the prime directive has many different functions not the least of which is to protect us to prevent us from allowing our emotions to overwhelm our judgement
my emotions are involved datas friend is going to die that means something
to data
does that invalidate the emotion
what if the dremans asked for our help
yes sarjenkas transmission could be viewed as a call for help
sophistry
ill buy that excuse were all jigging madly on the head of a pin anyway
she cannot ask for help from someone she does not know
she knows me
what a perfectly vicious little circle
we are going to allow her to die are we not
data i want you to sever the contact with drema four

isolating frequency
data data where are you why wont you answer are you angry me please please im so afraid data data where are you
wait oh data your whisper from the dark has now become a plea we cannot turn our backs
captains log stardate  we are entering into orbit of drema four the planet from which data received the distress signal sensors indicate that the volcanic activity is increasing

we found the reason for the geological instability
excellent
we would have missed it if ensign crusher hadnt requested an icogram but he did and
drema four has the largest deposit of dilithium ore ever recorded its also laid down in a very unusual pattern the crystals are growing to form perfectly aligned lattices
the ore is forming generator strata
which creates a piezoelectric effect
in plain english youre saying the dilithium is causing the geological catastrophe
right the crystals take the natural radiant heat of the planet
focus it and turn it into mechanical energy
which increases tectonic stresses
that tear the planet apart
and then the crystals break down which is why we found all these traces of illium 
so that takes care of the why now what can you do
that is going to take a little more work
can you reverse the process
we think so
no no theories no half answers yes or no
well get to work on it

sir datas out there right now monitoring the conditions on drema four the situations become pretty desperate for his friend hes calculated the safest location on the planets surface you can guess why
were just keep getting deeper and deeper in arent we
shes going to die theyre all going to die
unless
yes unless
all right you can tell commander data he has my permission to contact his friend and conduct her to a safer location number one you know where we are now
sir


sarjenka this is data respond please
unable to complete transmission
reason for failure
atmospheric activity interfering with rf signal

were modifying class one probes so they become resonators we will then use torpedo casings to protect them once they begin burrowing beneath the surface
how will these resonators destroy the crystals
by emitting harmonic vibrations which will shatter the lattices
the enterprise will monitor and adjust the frequency of the resonators
sounds like a plan lets get started

captain
tea earl grey hot
captain permission to beam down to drema four
what
i have been unable to contact sarjenka
data i appreciate your concern transporting to the surface is only going to make a bad situation worse
sir i feel it is important to determine the reason for
come on data
captain your orders were to deliver the message correct
yes
then what is the difference between sending the message and delivering it personally
a whopping big one and you know it
sir we have come this far
in for a penny in for a pound is that what youre saying mister data
yes sir
oh hell go
sir
number one handle the transporter go
where would you say we are now sir


obrien take a nap you didnt see any of this youre not involved
right sir ill just standing over here dozing off
data youve got ten minutes thats it if you meet anybody but sarjenka
i will signal for immediate beam out

commander riker to the bridge
damn
i just woke up sir
you know what to do
no problem sir ill have him out of there as smooth as ice


sarjenka wait im data
data data you came data where have you been
it would take too long to explain you and your family must leave
we already have we ran when the tremors began
then why are you here
my father wouldnt let us take anything but i had to have my transmitter i knew you would come back and i didnt want you to find only silence the way i did
i am sorry for that but it is very complicated does your family know where you are
no
you cannot survive in this
what are we going to do
enterprise two to beam up you must come with me
where are we going  to the stars

theres going to be hell to pay
where is commander riker
on the bridge where are you going
to the bridge
and youre going to take that
dont leave me here please dont leave me
quite impossible


sir three minutes to resonator launch
where is he
hell be here

he has brought a child onto my ship and on my bridge
im sure mister data has a very good explanation
i do sir she was frightened and did not wish to be left alone
mister data kindly assume your station counsellor will you escort her to sickbay
no data no im scared dont make me go
its all right no ones going to hurt you
no
well just go and get a treat and then
no
captain i will see to it that she is not in the way
one minute to launch
come on itll be all right
no just leave me alone i want data
counsellor allow me please sarjenka no one will harm you these are my friends
mister data take your station and keep her with you this does concern her
ten seconds
i will require my hand thank you
firing torpedoes

sensors locked on probes
torpedoes have reached their targets
resonators activated harmonic sequences have begun
what are you doing
we are attempting to quiet your planet if we succeed there will be no more quakes no more volcanoes
ensign when should the results be known
they should happen very quickly sir
and my parents and brothers
captain sensors indicate a planetwide reduction in tectonic stress levels
it worked we did it
your parents will be safe now
you did this for me
look sarjenka there is your home
data escort her to sickbay
aye sir
number one you have the bridge

doctor
yes captain
data and the alien are on their way down what would be involved in removing all memory of her communication with data

and her visit to this ship
assuming her brain structure is similar to ours the memories would be stored chemically on the neurons of the cerebral cortex theyre also time dependent i would have to scan for age of the chemical links and try to find

the relevant neurons
well do your best

you have many different kinds of people here
yes
when i am bigger can i be on your ship
i am certain that you could
i wish i could come with you now
i am afraid that is not possible
i know but i can still wish for it

doctor pulaski this is sarjenka
hello sarjenka
hello

what is this
an elanin singer stone it sings a different song for each person
what does it sing for you
it does not sing for me
why not
because i am a machine
sarjenka were going to run a few scans just to be sure youre all right datas will be right here dont worry


you did a good thing data
but are we doing a good thing now doctor
this is to protect her as much as us
by robbing her of her memories
to remember you and this ship would complicate her future she has to be the person she was born to be and youll remember


enterprise one to beam up


wes sit down
no thank you sir its going to be a long time before im qualified enough to sit here
you did a good job im proud of you
thank you sir does it get any easier
no

come

i came to apologise sir
no apologies are necessary you reminded us that there are obligations that go beyond duty
i appreciate your seeking other options sir your decision could have been unilateral
one of my officers one of my friends was troubled i had to help is sarjenka safely home
yes sir she will not remember me sir but i will remember her
remembrance and regrets they too are a part of friendship
yes sir
and understanding that has brought you a step closer to understanding humanity
q who


hot chocolate please
we dont ordinarily say please to food dispensers around here
well since its listed as intelligent circuitry why not after all working with so much artificial intelligence can be dehumanising right so why not combat that tendency with a little simple courtesy thank you
for someone who just arrived you certainly arent shy with your opinions
have i been talking too much
no
oh i do tend to have a bit of a motor mouth especially when im excited a nd you dont know how exciting it is to get this assignment everyone in class i mean everyone wants the enterprise i mean it would have been all right to spend some time on reiner six doing phase work with antimatter thats my specialty
i know thats why you got this assignment
i did it again its just that
i know youre excited look sonya
yes
i dont think you want to be around these control stations with that hot chocolate do you
oh im sorry i shouldnt even have this in engineering its just we were talking and i forgot i had it in my hand im going to go finish it over here lieutenant la forge this is not going to happen again

oh no oh im sorry oh captain
actually its my fault sir
indeed
oh i wasnt looking its all over you
yes ensign its all over me
at least let me sir
ensign er ensign
oh ensign sonya gomez
ensign gomez is a recent academy graduate she just transferred over at starbase one seventy three
is that so well ensign sonya gomez i think it will be simpler if i simply change my uniform
captain i must accept responsibility for this
yes chief engineer i think i understand
i just want to say sir that im very excited about this assignment and i promise to serve you and my ship your ship this ship to the best of my ability
yes ensign im sure that you will carry on

oh my first impressions right isnt that what they say first impressions are the most important
ill give you this its a meeting the captain wont soon forget

deck nine officers quarters


crewman what is going on
welcome picard to shuttlecraft six
q
there there havent we been careless a little cleaning service im only too than happy to provide

we agreed you would never trouble my ship again
i always keep my arrangements sir look were nowhere near your vessel

i read your graduating thesis now i wouldnt have requested you if you werent the best
where are we going
ten forward were going to forget about work we are going to sit talk relax look at the stars you need to learn how to slow down
oh no no no no no i cant do
you know youre awfully young to be so driven
yes i am i had to be i had to be the best because only the best get to be here geordi lieutenant
its okay go on
whatever is out here were going to be the first humans to see it and i want to be a part of that i want to understand it
sonya relax youre here youve made it but you wont last long banging into walls itll be there for you believe me
okay
look i promise i wont let anything exciting slip past without letting you know okay
okay
okay


bridge this is ten forward

guinan i dont remember you ever calling the bridge before
is everything alright
how do you mean
is there anything unusual happening
no guinan nothing out of the ordinary why do you ask

im not sure its just a feeling ive had it a couple of times before its probably nothing forget that i called ten forward out

the locator beacon wont help theyll never think to look for you this far away
enterprise this is picard stop this foolishness q return me to the enterprise
i suggest you change your attitude petulance does not become you we have business picard
keeping me a prisoner here will not compel me to discuss anything with you
it will in time

i appreciate your advice lieutenant and ill take it to heart
guinan
can i get you something
were fine is everything all right
i dont know
i think ill go check out engineering
ill go with you

wheres the captain
in his quarters
captain this is counsellor troi
computer locate captain picard
the captain is not on the ship
commander there is a shuttle missing from bay two
all stop
answering all stop sir
i have hailed the shuttle on all frequencies no response
sensors indicate no shuttle or other ships in this sector
we think we can assume the captain is aboard that shuttle
how could he get to the shuttlebay and leave the enterprise without us knowing thats not possible
take it easy wes were going to find him i want to begin a methodical search worf set sensors on maximum scan data use our present location as a centre plot a search pattern from these coordinates to cover the most area in the least time
search pattern has been input sir
engage mister crusher
first officers log stardate  we have not been able to determine why or how captain picard left the enterprise we cant even be certain he is in the missing shuttle although that is the assumption on which we are proceeding for the last six hours we have been searching without success

we have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a vessel without warp drive could traverse in the time allotted
widen the area


do we stay out here years decades i am ageless picard you are not
the enterprise will continue with riker as captain
you are an impossibly stubborn human
return me to my ship
if i return you to your ship will you agree to give my request a full hearing


youre right picard this is the proper venue for our discussion


commander my status board indicates that the shuttle is back in bay two
computer locate captain picard
captain picard is in ten forward

i knew it was you
you picard if you had half the sense you pretend to have you would get her off your ship immediately and if you like id be more than pleased to expedite her departure
you know him
we have had some dealings
those dealings were two centuries ago this creature is not what she appears to be shes an imp and where she goes trouble always follows
youre speaking of yourself q not guinan
guinan is that your name now
guinan is not the issue here you are we had an agreement that you would stop meddling with us
and so i have
what do you want q you state your business get on with it
i agree captain enough about this creature shes diverting us from the purpose of my being here

which is
ah the redoubtable commander riker and microbrain growl for me let me know you still care
worf
my purpose is to join you
to join us as what
as a member of the crew willing and able ready to serve this ship is already home for the indigent the unwanted the unworthy why not for a homeless entity
homeless
yes
the other members of the q continuum kicked you out
not all the q are alike some are almost respectable
ready and willing able to serve what would you do would you start as an ordinary crewman what task is too menial for an entity
sir do you mock me
not at all thats the last thing i would do you by definition are part of our charter our mission is to go forth to seek out new and different life forms and you certainly qualify as one of the most unique ive ever encountered to learn about you is frankly provocative but youre next of kin to chaos
captain at least allow me to present my argument
worf

after our last encounter i was asked to leave the q continuum since then ive been wandering vaguely bored really my existence without purpose then i remembered all the good times i had with you
the good times the first time we met you you put us on trial for the crimes of humanity
of which you were exonerated
the next time we saw you you asked me to join the q continuum
a big mistake that you did not accept my offer more and more i realise that here here is where i want to be think of the advantages now i neither expect nor require any special treatment and if necessary although i cant imagine why i will renounce my powers and become as weak and incompetent as all of you
no
no oh captain in fairness let me try i deserve at least that much
in fairness you disrupt this ship you kidnap the captain
i add a little excitement a little spice to your lives and all you do is complain wheres your adventurous spirit your imagination think picard think think of the possibilities
simply speaking we dont trust you
oh well you may not trust me but you do need me youre not prepared for what awaits you
how can we be prepared for that which we do not know but i do know that we are ready to encounter it
really
yes absolutely thats why were out here
oh the arrogance they dont have a clue as to whats out here
but they will learn adapt that is their greatest advantage
theyre moving faster than expected further than they should
by whose calculations
you judge yourselves against the pitiful adversaries you have encountered so far the romulans the klingons they are nothing compared to whats waiting picard you are about to move into areas of the galaxy containing wonders more incredible than you can possibly imagine and terrors to freeze your soul i offer myself as guide only to be rejected out of hand
well just have to do the best we can without you
what justifies that smugness
not smugness not arrogance but we are resolute we are determined and your help is not required
well just have to see how ready you are
q

bridge this is the captain all stop
answering all stop sir
status

according to these coordinates we have travelled seven thousand light years

and are located near the system j two five
travel time to the nearest starbase
at maximum warp in two years seven months three days eighteen hours we would reach starbase one eight five
why
why why to give you a taste of your future a preview of things to come con permiso capitan the hall is rented the orchestra engaged its now time to see if you can dance

guinan your people have been in this part of the galaxy
yes
what can you tell us
only that if i were you id start back now
captains log stardate  despite guinans warning i feel compelled to investigate this unexplored sector of the galaxy before heading back

captain the sixth planet in the system is class m
there is a system of roads on this planet which indicates a highly industrialised civilisation but where there should be cities there are only great rips in the surface
it is as though some great force just scooped all the machine elements off the face of the planet
it is identical to what happened to the outposts along the neutral zone
captain we are being probed
what is the source of the probe
a ship it is on an intercept course
on screen magnify

full scan
go to yellow alert
going to yellow alert
keep the shields down we dont want to appear provocative
aye sir
mister data what can you tell us
the ship is strangely generalised in design there is no specific bridge no command centre there is no engineering section i can identify no living quarters
life signs
there is no indication of life
lieutenant worf what is its alert status
i detect no shields no weapons of any known design
hailing frequencies
open
this is captain jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise
no response
this is captain picard representing the united federation of planets guinan

activate your viewscreen i would like you to monitor whats going on up here i may need your input


im here captain

viewscreens activated i have the other ship
youre familiar with this life form
yes

my people encountered them a century ago they destroyed our cities

they scattered my people throughout the galaxy

theyre called the borg protect yourself captain or theyll destroy you

shields up
aye sir

all decks stand by

security report to main engineering we have an intruder

lieutenant status
it seemed to make a visual survey of the engine core sir then it moved in here
interesting isnt it not a he not a she not like anything youve ever seen an enhanced humanoid
what is it you want we mean you no harm do you understand me
understand you youre nothing to him hes not interested in your life form hes just a scout the first of many hes here to analyse your technology he may attempt to gain control of the ship i wouldnt let him

stop i cannot allow you to interfere with the operation of this ship mister worf
ensign

mister worf use whatever means to neutralise the intruder


because her people had contact with the borg i have requested guinan to participate in this conference you are aware of what occurred just now in main engineering
yes
what happened between your people and the borg
i wasnt there personally but from what im told they swarmed through our system and when they left there was little or nothing left of my people
guinan if they were that aggressive why didnt the borg attack they could have but they didnt
they dont do that individually its not their way when they decide to come theyre going to come in force they dont do anything piecemeal
then the initial encounter was solely for the purpose of gathering information
yes
how do we reason with them let them know that we are not a threat
you dont at least ive never known anyone who did
captain we are being hailed
on screen

this is captain jeanluc picard of the
 we have analysed your defensive capabilities as being unable to withstand us if you defend yourselves you will be punished
counsellor
were not dealing with an individual mind they dont have a single leader its the collective minds of all of them
that would have definite advantages
yes a single leader can make mistakes its far less likely in the combined whole
picard picard are you sure you dont want me as a member of your crew
captain the borg have locked on to us with some form of tractor beam
were on our way


report lieutenant
the beam is draining our shields
if they pull down our shields were helpless
warp eight any heading engage
captain the beam is holding us here
increase power
shields weakening
shields will be down in eighteen seconds
locate the exact source of the tractor beam lock on phasers
phasers locked on target
fire
they still have us
shields are down sir

a type of laser beam is slicing into the saucer section
carving us up like a roast
with whatever force necessary terminate that beam fire when ready

again mister worf

tractor beam is released sir force field is maintaining our hull integrity
damage report
coming in sir sections twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine on decks four five and six destroyed
casualties
eighteen were in those sections and are missing
what is the condition of the alien ship
they have sustained damage to twenty percent of their vessel life support minimal
conference

i cant get the shields up
divert power from anywhere you need it anywhere except for life support
no it wouldnt help the circuits which control the shields theyve been fused
if you cant reprogram then reroute
eighteen people dead just like that
i know just put it out of your head
no i cant i keep seeing them
sonya stop it well have time to grieve later right now lets just get those shields operative
right right of course

guinan how much more can you tell us about these creatures
bits and pieces
anything would help
theyre made up of organic and artificial life which has been developing for thousands of centuries
the borg is the ultimate user theyre unlike any threat your federation has ever faced theyre not interested in political conquest wealth or power as you know it theyre simply interested in your ship its technology theyve identified it as something they can consume
you brought us here you exposed us to them and you cost us the lives of our shipmates
oh please
number one eighteen of our people have died please tell us this is one of your illusions
oh no this is as real as your so called life gets

this is lieutenant la forge captain weve been able to restore power to the shields
very good
captain i have the casualty list coming on screen
cancel well deal with that later
sir if were going to have further dealings with the borg now or in the future i think that we should find out all we can about them
visit their ship
in my opinion thats the only choice
assemble a minimal away team
what
mister worf transporter room three data
i wouldnt go there if i were you
oh i dont know guinan they paid us a visit it seems only fair that we return the courtesy
captains log supplemental we have been attacked without provocation by an alien race which guinan calls the borg it appears that we have neutralised their vessel commander riker is leading an away team in an attempt to learn more about them

there are no life sign readings
ive laid in coordinates which should set you down in the least damaged section of the borg ship
set phasers on stun be ready to increase power in case we need it energise


i wonder why they dont react to us or why the enterprise didnt read any life signs especially with this many of them
perhaps because this ship was scanned for individual life signs apparently when they are in these slots they become part of the whole and no longer read as separate life forms
captain

go ahead number one
our readings were incorrect the borg crew survived

they appear to be in some kind of stasis
explain
there are slots along the wall kind of like compartments there are two borg in each
captain i would theorise that the borg are somehow interconnected through these slots and are working collectively
were going try to access their main computer

commander i believe each slot is designed for a specific borg here is where the connection is made
like a juggernaut it could begin moving at any moment
the technology required to achieve this biological and artificial interface is far beyond our capabilities there are many advantages
speed being the most obvious this ship literally just thinks what it wants and then it happens

fascinating
they either dont see us or dont see us as a threat

transporter chief

obrien here captain
if your lock on the away team wavers in the slightest beam them back immediately
count on it sir


captain this is incredible weve entered what appears to be the borg nursery
describe it
from the look of it the borg are born as biological life form it seems that almost immediately after birth they begin artificial implants apparently the borg have developed the technology

to link artificial intelligence directly into the humanoid brain

astounding
commander
what is it
the ship appears to be regenerating perhaps this explains why they have not taken notice of our presence their collective effort is being directed into repairing this vessel
captain

the borg seem to be using their combined power to repair the ship
transporter chief beam the away team directly to the bridge

lets get the hell out of here warp eight now mister crusher engage
captain the borg are in pursuit
on screen magnify
increase to ten to the third power

its continuing to regenerate
lets see if we can outrun them lieutenant la forge i want maximum warp

for as long as we can hold it
yes sir we are passing warp eight point five

eight point eight warp nine
arm the photon torpedoes see if we can slow them down
torpedoes armed
fire

they had no effect
bridge this is engineering we are now at warp nine point six five
the borg are still gaining
they will follow this ship until you exhaust your fuel they will wear down your defences then you will be theirs admit it picard youre out of your league you should have stayed where you belonged
captains log supplemental we are unable to maintain the gap between the enterprise and the borg ship

engineering to bridge
go ahead
youve got all we can give you
i understand mister la forge
captain the enemy vessel is firing on us there are no reports of any damage to the enterprise
captain the target was not the ship the weapon was designed to drain the shields
confirmed shield effectiveness has been reduced twelve percent
captain the borg ship is closing
theyre firing again shields have been reduced forty one percent another hit and we will be defenceless
arm the photon torpedoes
torpedoes armed
fire the photons
the borg ship was not damaged
you cant outrun them you cant destroy them if you damage them the essence of what they are remains they regenerate and keep coming eventually you will weaken your reserves will be gone they are relentless
the borg ship is firing we have lost shields again

captain weve just lost the warp engines

wheres your stubbornness now picard your arrogance do you still profess to be prepared for what awaits you
the borg ship is reestablishing its tractor beam
lock on photon torpedoes
yes sir
without our shields at this range there is a high degree of probability that a photon detonation could destroy the enterprise
prepare to fire

ill be leaving now you thought you could handle it so handle it
q end this
moi what makes you think i am either inclined or capable to terminate this encounter
if we all die here now you will not be able to gloat you wanted to frighten us were frightened you wanted to show us that we were inadequate for the moment i grant that you wanted me to say i need you i need you

position
zero seven zero mark six three sir back where we started

that was a difficult admission another man would have been humiliated to say those words another man would have rather died than ask for help
i understand what youve done here q but i think the lesson could have been learned without the loss of eighteen members of my crew
if you cant take a little bloody nose maybe you ought to go back home and crawl under your bed its not safe out here its wondrous with treasures to satiate desires both subtle and gross but its not for the timid

mister crusher set course for the nearest starbase
course laid in for starbase eighty three sir
engage


q set a series of events into motion bringing contact with the borg much sooner than it should have come now perhaps when youre ready it might be possible to establish a relationship with them but for now for right now youre just raw material to them since they are aware of your existence
they will be coming
you can bet on it
maybe q did the right thing for the wrong reason
how so
well perhaps what we most needed was a kick in our complacency to prepare us ready for what lies ahead
samaritan snare

captains log stardate  were en route to the epsilon nine sector for astronomical survey of a new pulsar cluster in the meantime ensign crusher will be diverting to starbase five one five for starfleet exams

this just came in for you from starfleet

testing parameters
do not be apprehensive wes i found the academy examinations quite elementary
you would
your earlier test results were good enough to get you academy credit for your work here i dont think you have anything to worry about
those academy cadets can be extremely competitive
but you have the practical experience wes
commander riker is correct while the information imparted to cadets at the academy is unquestionably vital for prospective starfleet officers it nevertheless requires a significant period of supplementary systems training and situational disciplines
didnt i just say that
yes sir but not quite as perspicuously

i will not have you telling me what course to set
as chief medical officer i am ordering you to report to starbase five one five immediately
oh please i feel fine
the truth is youve ignored this far too long
this ship has a mission to carry out
an astronomical survey to be conducted by the science officers i believe
and i was looking forward to seeing the epsilon pulsar cluster for myself
then well perform the procedure right here
absolutely not
my staff and i are fully capable of giving you the replacement
thats not the point it would be  it would be inappropriate for you to carry out the procedure
captain picard i had no idea you do have an ego dont you
meaning
youre concerned about your image dont worry if you get yourself down to starbase five one five your image will be safe with me


captain excuse me
ensign i understand youre leaving for starbase five one five
yes sir i was just going to shuttlebay two
good i have business there i shall accompany you
you will i mean yes sir
prepare the shuttle for immediate departure
aye sir
something i can take care of for you on starbase five one five
hardly number one
but youll miss the epsilon pulsar survey
im well aware of that fact you have the bridge carry on


come yes what is it number one
is something wrong this trip to starbase five one five is rather unexpected
ensign crusher and i will rendezvous with you on your return from the epsilon pulsar cluster
forgive my saying so sir but youre being rather enigmatic
consider it captains privilege
as first officer i have complete security clearance
this has nothing to do with ships business number one suffice it to say it is strictly a matter of image

relax wes youll do fine on your exams
yeah
its not my exams im worried about its captain picard
why hes not taking the exams
its just the two of us in a shuttlecraft for six hours what am i going to talk to captain picard about for six hours
archaeology semantics literature art you could learn a lot from captain picard

ah captain picard nice day for a little trip


shuttle number two is ready for departure
the enterprise is at impulse speed you are cleared for take off


data wasnt the captain looking forward to this mission to the epsilon pulsar cluster
so he said
then what would make him change his mind why would he leave the ship now

aye sir
viewer
deploy shields sir
hold fast data
basic early design capable of sublight travel only
sir we are being hailed
on screen
i am first officer william riker of the uss enterprise were responding to your distress signal

what is your problem
we are far from home

arent we all but you sent out a mayday

do you need help
we are pakleds our ship is the mondor it is broken

we are far from home we need help
let me guess their rubber band broke right
sensors indicate engineering problems theyre experiencing total guidance system failure with less than twenty four hours reserve power
maybe i can help
what brings you so far from home
we look for things
what were you looking for
things we need
can you be more specific
things that make us go we need help
what is the nature of your mission
we look for things
did you hear an echo
commander from the looks of their ship i could have them up and running in no time
you sure
yeah no problem
very well our chief engineer will beam over to help you close
commander do we truly need to send our chief engineer over to them
obviously they need our help
why do we not simply give them the information they need to make their own repairs
do you honestly get the impression they could handle our technical specifications
we do not know anything about them
acknowledged mister worf we have an obligation to render aid report to the transporter room with all necessary gear
aye sir

we need more information
do you have anything else on them
they are a relatively benign species
dont they seem a little slow
they may merely have poorly developed language skills
what about weapons
scanners shows limited armaments
i think we can relax mister worf they cant even move their ship without our help we certainly have them outmanned and outgunned

eta thirteen thirty hours sir its not exactly warp speed
more like a late twentysecond century interplanetary journey
sir
you should read more history ensign
yes sir
complete waste of time
pardon
i shouldnt be taking this trip at all i should be back on board the enterprise
why are you coming with me to starbase five one five sir
well its certainly not my idea im sorry ensign i didnt mean to take it out on you i just hate the prospect of another damned cardiac replacement
cardiac replacement i didnt know
well now you do
a parthenogenetic implant
what else would it be my heart was injured and a replacement was necessary that would have been it except that the replacement is faulty
why would anyone use a faulty replacement
just pilot the shuttle ensign


whoa whoa wait a minute its okay im here to help
we are far from home
whos in charge of engineering
my friend his name is reginod
think i could meet him
he is reginod
yes i think you mentioned that
we look for things
so ive heard
can you make our ship go
yes i think so
we look for things to make us go
fellas why dont you show me where your guidance system is okay excuse me
he is smart


commander lieutenant la forge is on an alien ship
yes were rendering assistance to some curious throwbacks
how they ever mastered the rudiments of space travel is a genuine curiosity
commander those aliens what they feel is not helplessness lieutenant la forge is in great danger hes in danger great danger
can you be more specific counsellor
its not our help they want
well our help is all theyre going to get they cant force us into anything can they
you think theyre weak
look at them theyre certainly not jarada or romulans
our betazoid counsellor is often aware of things beyond our perceptive abilities

van dorens technique has been perfected to two point four percent
sir
the cardiac replacement procedure it has a very low mortality rate two point four percent
those are pretty good odds
just not overly thrilled at the prospect of having my innards becoming the subject of starfleet gossip
of course not sir why didnt you just have doctor pulaski perform the operation im sure you couldve trusted her to keep it quiet
lets say i have personal reasons and leave it at that shall we

the power needs to be rerouted through this venturi chamber before it can be channelled to the engines coils
it is broken
yeah but not for long see we are going to reconfigure these separators here and over here
lieutenant la forge this is commander riker come in
yes commander go ahead

are you all right
sure why do you ask
counsellor troi has expressed misgivings about your absence from the enterprise
i dont think theres anything to worry about
understood as soon as you complete the repairs i want you back here
yes sir i should be done here momentarily

you see like that  there your guidance is now up and running

main power failure
will our ship go now
your guidance is operational but youre not going anywhere not with a main power failure
it is broken
can you make it go
commander riker

i have a problem
on screen
it looks like this is going to take a little bit longer than i anticipated

i guess you would have preferred commander riker as a travelling companion
what
its okay youre not too comfortable with me i understand
ensign wesley thats not true youre a fine young man
you dont have to say that sir its pretty obvious how you feel
is it how so
everyone knows you dont like kids thats too bad youd have made a good father
thank you

didnt you ever wish you had kids of your own
wishing for a thing does not make it so


we send him over there for one set of repairs now they need him for more
apparently their ship is apparently quite fragile
this is riker on the enterprise
almost got it commander
we look for things
apparently your ship is in need of more than minor repair
things to make it go
we will use our tractor beam to tow you to the nearest base
he can make it go
yes but we need our chief engineer back on board our ship

he is smart
all done commander
prepare to beam over
yes sir

you are good
we aim to please
we need you
im flattered look fellas i hate to repair and run but if youll excuse me one to beam aboard

hey dont

transporter room beam la forge back immediately
aye negative response sir
try again
negative response
the pakled ship has a shield up sir
a shield what kind
it appears to be beyond their technology similar to romulan shields
do not interfere with our transporter beam drop your shields

status
viewer transmission terminated and blocked
hail on all frequencies
running frequency search negative sir
theyre ignoring us
apparently so
shields up
shields up
sensors at maximum sensitivity
sensors at maximum
phasers ready sir

would you care for some coffee ensign
no thank you sir
how about a sandwich
i dont think so sir
oh come on its been hours you must be hungry

thank you sir
here 
were you ever married
never had the time
dont you ever get lonely
for ambitious starfleet officers there are certain costs involved one must be cautious of longterm commitments wesley
no problem where women are concerned i am in complete control
really i always rather had to work at that
have you always been so disciplined
good lord no if i was i wouldnt have this problem
i dont understand
well i was a young starfleet officer not many years older than you are now top of my academy class green as hell and oh so cocky too cocky as it turned out
what happened
several friends and i were on leave at farspace starbase earhart it was little more than a galactic outpost in those days
was this before the klingons joined the federation
thats right well my mates and i were at the bonestell recreation facility which was something of a dead rough crossroads at the time filled with an assorted bunch of galactic riffraff when a trio of nausicaans came in they were clearly spoiling for a confrontation with a group of freshfaced starfleet officers such as ourselves well everyone in the group had the good sense to give these nausicaans a wide berth to stand off everyone that is except me i stood toe to toe with the worst of the three and i told him what i thought of him his pals his planet and i possibly made some passing reference to his questionable parentage and the next thing i knew all three of them were on me and i was fighting for my life i was actually doing quite well for a while too
you fought them and won
i had this one nausicaan down in this somewhat devious jointlock when unbeknownst to me one of his chums drew his weapon and impaled me through the back curious sensation actually not much pain shock certainly at the sight of serrated metal sticking through my chest a certain giddy warmth in fact i do actually remember that i laughed out loud well it pierced my heart of course well if wed not been so near to a medical facility i would surely have died
really then what happened
nothing i was no hero wesley i was an undisciplined loudmouthed opinionated young man who was way out of his league i learned a very hard very painful lesson that day but i learned it well i hope you never have to learn it the same way care for another sandwich
please

come on data
i am programming the comm system to scan the interference patterns but a full analysis will take time


you be careful with that thing
you want to hurt us
what i came here to help you
we can make more
make more weapons
wait a minute you have a replicator
it is not broken
i didnt come here to give you weapons
you will make more

commander a photon torpedo may penetrate their shield
any hostile move on our part could jeopardise geordi
agreed but what do the pakleds want
counsellor
they have what they want for now

were approaching starbase five one five sir
at last did you read that book i gave you
some of it
thats reassuring
i just dont have much time
there is no greater challenge than the study of philosophy
but william james wont be in my starfleet exams
the important things never will be anyone can be trained in the mechanics of piloting a starship
but starfleet academy
it takes more open your mind to the past art history philosophy and all this may mean something

its all deception nothing the pakleds have said or done has been sincere
intensified scan shows their guidance system to be perfectly intact as is their power generator
then what was geordi repairing
apparently the putative malfunctions were carefully programmed into their ships computer
i didnt think the pakleds had that kind of technology
they seem to have made some technological leaps forward commander
why would they go through the charade of needing our help
for the sole purpose of making lieutenant la forge their prisoner
captains personal log stardate  we have arrived at starbase five one five im still quite uneasy despite assurances that this medical procedure poses little risk

i hope you wont be late for your exams
i still have some time sir
why do i get the distinct impression youre acting like some kind of escort
doctor pulaski asked me to make sure you actually went inside
that woman she would
sir
yes what is it ensign
i enjoyed our trip together sir
so did i

they are initiating visual contact sir
maybe now well find out what they really want
enterprise
we demand that you return our crewmember immediately
request denied
lower your shield
request denied

stop it what do you want
you think we are not smart
i think you need to continue to develop
we are smart
prove it return our man to us
you want him
yes damn it
good we want all computer information from your ship now

weve got a man held hostage by alien forces and all i have are nooption options i need some input
is geordi all right
hes already been hit by multiple phaser stuns
he could need medical attention
security team stands ready to take the initiative sir
data
our options have not changed we can either respond to the pakled demand or not we can either use force or not
allowing them access to our computer is a complete breech of starfleet security
then force it must be


dont worry about a thing captain weve done this a hundred times and were ready when you are
just get on with it doctor ive got work to do
activate sterile field neural callipers

this will be a secondary cardiac procedure with midline entry and excision of the early model unit i anticipate no complications as the patient has had positive primary results and exhibits extraordinary physical condition well all be home in time for dinner tissue mitigator

theres limited information available on pakled culture but the eclectic range of their equipment suggests their technology was borrowed from others
and now they have become militant
so it would seem
rationale
they are unwilling to wait for the timely evolution of their species intellectual capacity they want instant knowledge instant power and gratification
the more they get the more they want
and the more aggressive and dangerous they become i think its time we set some limits
to what effect sir we are faced with an impossible conundrum
suppose we turn their impatience and greed against them
but how
perhaps geordi should give them something they want something important then we simply create the right moment for him to take it away and get him the hell out of there
would you be suggesting a ruse of some sort
i would
but what if we fail whatll happen to geordi then
we have no other choice we have to try

theres been some capillary reaction here lets proceed carefully well need sharper focus on the thoracic polychromatics and verification of myocardial enzyme balance

let me talk to them ill get you their computer banks
we want to be smart
so open the hailing frequency theyll listen to me
we are smart
we need their computer things
yes yes


hey let me talk to him ill get you their computer banks
we want to be smart
so open the hailing frequency theyll listen to me
we are smart
we need their computer things
yes yes

commander riker
yes lieutenant were here
the pakleds seem pretty sincere
we want what we want
our computer banks are nonnegotiable
we want them
believe me theyre nothing if not persistent
we want to be nothing if not persistent
nobody ever said they were great conversationalists
where did they get their shields
yes we like shields
well from what ive seen half the systems on this ship have been stolen from romulans klingons jarada just about anybody theyve ever came in contact with
we like to be smart
confirmed lieutenant la forge they steal technology
but they lack the ability to use it properly
youre an excellent chief engineer lieutenant la forge
thank you sir
and of course your knowledge of phaser and photon weaponry is unmatched
thats nice of you to say sir but really lieutenant worf
our missions are always inherently dangerous and any of us could be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice at any time
yes sir but
speaking of time this may be your time i shall personally miss you
goodbye geordi i shall miss you at weapons systems analysis
and i guess youll just have to arm your photon torpedo countdowns without me
as well as our hydrogen collectors fond farewell
he knows about weapons
you can make us strong
its not something i really like to talk about
any classified weapons knowledge you share with your captors will be considered treason
but i may have no choice
you will die without honour
thanks a lot worf
you will never attain the twenty fourth level of awareness
twentyfour thats quite a challenge
indeed twenty four is the gateway to heroic salvation

do you think he understands
hed better
hes afraid
we all are counsellor

you are smart
not smart enough im still here
make us strong
i thought you wanted me to help you go why dont we work on that guidance system okay
make us strong or die

its not working somethings wrong the metabolation occlusions arent holding damn it i cant stop the heterocyclic declination fuse

again we need a biomolecular physiologist in here this man is dying
right away sir

youve got to be kidding
make us strong
come on theres not enough juice in these to blow up a passing asteroid
do it make us strong
i suppose we could increase the antimatter charges
yes we like power
yeah
do not try to trick us we can tell


metabolation
negative
heterocyclics
failing and capillary integrity too unpredictable to attempt a resect
youre unwilling to make the attempt
im not qualified
i know someone who is

are you sure he can do it sir geordis an engineer not a weapons specialist
if anyone can improvise its geordi
what makes you think the pakleds even have that kind of gear on board
ongoing scanning indicates progressive weapons potential the timing will be crucial geordi must correctly interpret our intentions
geordis up to speed i trust his instincts
the pakleds did hear our little fiction about geordis weapons knowledge
exactly and since they equate intelligence with strength they wont pass up the chance to use that knowledge can you do it
count on it
bridge to commander riker
go ahead bridge

i am receiving an emergency summons from starbase five one five captain picard

is close to death
be ready

we are strong
youre now armed to the teeth
teeth are for chewing
you have photon torpedo you are strong
we are strong we have power

positive indication of armed photon torpedoes commander
geordi did it
starbase requests we proceed to base at warp nine
weve got to go
yes the captain needs our help
we cant leave geordi behind i want the pakleds on that screen and i want them now
forced spectrum communications are spotty at best sir
do it
this is the enterprise return our personnel or face immediate reprisal
we are strong now we have better weapons
are you prepared to use them
we are a force now we will have respect power
we dont have time for this you want power heres power riker to ensign gomez

ready commander riker
prepare firing sequencing

start firing countdown from twenty four

i cant believe it my friends my people theyre trying to kill us kill me
believe it they are violent
okay they want to play rough thats fine with me just let me check something
good he is on our side now

begin firing sequence
twenty four twenty three

twenty two twenty one twenty
firing sequence proceeding sir
hold fast
eighteen seventeen

computer  sixteen fifteen
dont do anything yet
fourteen thirteen
what are you doing
making sure your systems are operative
we will attack we are strong

nine eight seven six five

we should attack now
just another second we cant afford a misfire here
two one
hurry

fire


now

no too late
we have fired they will be destroyed
they used their crimson force field
it did not shoot
no the crimson force field has disarmed us
they are smart
we are not strong
drop your shields

allow us transport lieutenant la forge immediately
shields are down
transporter room beam one to the bridge
aye sir

set heading for starbase five one five warp nine
blowing that hydrogen exhaust through the bussard collectors sure put on a nice light show
harmless but effective were you able disable the photons
just in time thats why youre still here

deactivating neural callipers

what the hell are you doing here
saving your life
oh come on this is a routine procedure quite commonplace
true but you are not a commonplace man youll be out of recovery in four hours
i didnt want you involved in this
youre welcome
if youre here the entire crew must know
youre still the captain invincible
thank you


i beg your pardon
looks like things are back to normal
im pleased to report that ensign crushers starfleet exam results permit him to continue his studies on board the enterprise furthermore any rumours of my brush with death are greatly exaggerated is that clear
yes sir
then ensign crusher set course for the epsilon sector warp five engage
up the long ladder



number one will you join me in the ready room
yes sir

ive just come from a meeting with admiral moore he wanted to discuss this

recognise it
sounds like it might be an sos
good guess youre quicker than starbase research it took them hours to determine this was a distress beacon
when was it detected
last month just kicked in without any warning
who used the beacon
its terran
captain im familiar with most earth codes and
interesting yes that code hasnt been used in centuries
what was its origin point
ficus sector
captain i dont think theres any record of an earth colony in that area
now we know theres someone out there and theyre asking for help
but who
lets try and find out computer download all information regarding signal beacon from starbase mainframe
distress beacon used by the european hegemony
the european hegemony
a loose alliance formed in the early part of the twenty second century it was the first stirrings of world government you should read more history number one computer locate exact dates in which this signal beacon was in general use
old earth calendar  until 
no extraterrestrial source ever used this code
negative
locate all earth deep space launches from  until  with a destination in or near the ficus sector
working

nothing for ficus
damn it whos out there
lost sheep
lets go see if we can find them


medical emergency doctor pulaski to the bridge

what happened
he just collapsed sir
captains log stardate  were departing from starbase seven three to investigate the source of the mysterious distress signal meanwhile my security officer remains in sickbay where doctor pulaski is searching for the cause of his collapse

i am fine
youre not fine you fainted
i did not faint klingons do not faint
excuse me ill rephrase this klingon suffered a dramatic drop in blood pressure his blood glucose level dropped there was deficient blood flow resulting from circulatory failure in other words he curled up his toes and laid unconscious on the floor
doctor there is no need to insult me
worf i am worried now something is wrong klingons dont faint forgive me i just cant think of another word that applies youre sick
klingons do not give in to illness
just stay right where you are i have to check something with the computer lieutenant you have ropngor
but that is a childhood ailment
yes
how shall i live down the humiliation
worf you cant help
still for a warrior to find himself in such a situation
so youve got the klingon version of the measles
how would commander riker feel if he had the measles
pretty silly
doctor pulaski how is lieutenant worf
hes in no danger worf was just observing a klingon ritual involving fasting and he didnt take into account that you have to decrease your physical activity as you decrease your caloric intake pulaski out
thank you i am in your debt

come

captain i have been considering the problem of the missing ship although there is no record of a launch to the ficus sector which would not be unusual considering the chaos of the early twenty second century someone had to load that ship
the manifest
yes sir
there it is ss mariposa loaded th november  destination ficus sector captain walter granger commanding
mariposa the spanish word for butterfly
thank you data
i thought it might be significant sir
it doesnt appear to be data
no sir
you learn a lot about people from their luggage two hundred and twenty five yoshimitsu computers five monitor beacon satellites seven hundred cellular commlinks fifty spinning wheels
 spinning wheels accessing a device for spinning yarn or thread that consists of a large foot or hand driven wheel and one spindle
cattle chickens pigs not dna the actual livestock incredible why would anyone carry such an insane mix of cargo
spindle a thin rounded tapering rod
data
perhaps they were planning for the worst sir
theorise data give me some background
in the early twentysecond century earth was recovering from world war three a major philosopher of the period was liam dieghan founder of the neotranscendentalists who advocated a return to a simpler life in which one lived in harmony with nature and learned under her gentle tutelage
thank you data but if this was a ship full of utopians why carry all this technological baggage
i have insufficient information from which to form a cogent theory sir


doctor i wished to thank you for protecting my
your secret is safe with me worf im honoured no one has ever performed the klingon tea ceremony for me

there that should do it
you know the ceremony
i understand the externals not the mysteries im not a klingon
you must not drink the tea it is deadly to humans
and none too good for klingons
it is a test of bravery of ones ability to look at the face of mortality it is also a reminder that death is an experience best shared like the tea
worf youre a romantic
it is among the klingons that love poetry achieves its fullest flower
hold that thought

antidote if were going to share lets share  now quote me a little of that poetry

initiate sensor sweeps
aye sir the systems sun has entered a period of severe flare activity
now we know what triggered the sos
class m readings from the fifth planet in the system
take us in
shields at maximum
sensors indicate human life form readings thirty metres below the planets surface
hailing on all frequencies no response so far but the flares may be interfering with communications
there is no evidence of an advanced communication network
they brought a lot of technology where is it
there is no artificial power source on the planet
the stellar flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency computer projections indicate they will brush the planet in three point six hours
evacuation will be difficult we can lower our shields for transport only between the flares
captain these people have been isolated for three hundred years they could be very unsophisticated the shock of suddenly being transported onto a spaceship could frighten them to say the least
your point is well taken counsellor number one youre going to have to go down there
on my way
captains log stardate  commander riker has reached the caverns where he is making preparations to begin the evacuation

whats the situation number one
there are roughly two hundred people down here
their condition
surprisingly good
are they willing to leave
yes but
well get them up here
im having a little debate with the colonys leader it seems
theres no time number one initiate the transport
but sir
whatever the problem well handle it up here
aye aye sir were on our way all of us riker out

first load ready mister obrien
energising

captain youd better get somebody down here right away

take the pig out there will you very good
obrien i think that third wave should be in position
shoo damn you shoo
aye sir
obrien is it  i should have known twould be a good irishman that was running this ship

what the devil is going on here number one
ah captain picard is it the man who makes decisions for me and mine without so much as a by your leave
this is my security chief lieutenant worf
 i dont suppose security is much of a problem for you danilo odell sir at your service
what are these animals doing here number one
im sorry sir it was either this or arguing till hell froze over
captain picard sir we cant leave our animals here to die besides how could we build our future without our animals
all right chief obrien transport this group directly to cargo hold seven and beam the remaining refugees from the planet directly to that hold
yes sir
right lads everybody back onto the infernal machine
everybody up here

captain captain twas very good of you sir to rescue us from our troubles
my pleasure
sir you must be worth quite a bit to own a fine ship like this
i dont own the enterprise i command her
whatever sir would you happen to be married
no why
no well you see sir i have a daughter
felicitations
would you be interested sir
no
youre quite sure
quite sure
hes quite sure

whats the total
two hundred and twenty three
count on two more in the next few days
set course for the nearest starbase
you know they were anachronistic in  it will be interesting to see how they cope
theyll learn and adapt if danilo odells any indication theyll be running this place inside of a week

lieutenant worf here report
fire in cargo hold seven
the bringloidi
what have they done to my ship now

keep the area clear
report
fire has been contained no damage
unseal the doors
my god picard the place is a bloody death trap lightning bolts falling from the ceiling

what the hell was that thing
automated fire system a force field contains the flame until the remaining oxygen within the field has been consumed
what if i had been under that thing
you would have been standing in the fire
well leaving that aside for the moment i mean what would have happened to me
you would have suffocated and died
sweet mercy
oh there you are your hospitality leaves a hell of a lot to be desired you dont offer us a bite or a sup and when we build a fire to cook a little something the place goes mad
my apologies i was unaware that you had not been instructed in the use of the food dispensers
and what are you staring at have you never seen a woman before
i thought i had
commander may i present my daughter brenna odell
pleased to meet you maam
you may have all the time in the world but ive dozens of frightened and hungry children and women to look after
and what about the men
well im sure theyll find their comfort as they always do in the bottom of a mug of home brew
pay no heed commander shes a fine girl shes not usually so sharp tongued
dado

sir  thats the last thing i expected
sometimes number one you just have to bow to the absurd
captain captain sir how did the ship sense the fire
the ships computer
computer
the ships computers sense a localised increase
men always talking when theres work to be done and shouldnt you be flying this ship or whatever it is you do
sir i think ill stay and give her some help

that isnt necessary the ship will clean itself
well good for the bloody ship  tell me commander riker where does a girl go to wash her feet on this ship
as the first officer i feel its my responsibility to show you all the amenities

she is very like a klingon woman
ah captain theres just one other thing it slipped my mind in all the hustle and bustle
the point mister odell
well in all your travels have you heard anything from the other colony
the other colony
captains log supplemental a review of stellar charts has revealed a class m planet only half a light year from the bringloid system i am proceeding on the premise that it was the destination of the colony which possessed the more sophisticated equipment

william riker youre a mess

you dont have to do that
and if i dont who will
i can see why your father wants to marry you off
oh and why is that
so he can have a pipe and mug of beer in peace
youve shown me so many wonders on your great ship but theres still one thing you havent shown me
whats that
im still waiting to wash my feet
right behind that door
william is something wrong
what do you mean
do you not like girls
of course i do oh is there a technique to this foot washing
you generally start at the top and work your way down
i think i can handle that

i was hoping you might

you sent for me
ah yes yes now were brewing poteen but we need to find a way to heat it without this bloody ship firing bloody lightning bolts at us
you can obtain spirituous liquours from the food dispensers
oh no no no its not that synthehol bilge that obrien offered me is it
no if you wish it can be real alcohol
good
with all of the deleterious effects intact
as it should be you see lad every moment of pleasure in life has to be purchased by an equal moment of pain whiskey

terrible its got no bite
chechtluth

now thats what i call a wee drop of the creature
father
remember what i said about the moment of pain well tis about to begin hello my darling
oh my darling is it i might have known are you drunk yet or can you talk with doctor pulaski about the children
what about them
she wants to send them to school with the ships children
what do you think
i think its a good idea so go handle it  im sure theres something you can be doing with your time  and as for you
what
why did you have to tell them that this magic wall can give them more than meat and potatoes now well never get a lick of work out of them
madam have you considered a career in security
if its anything like babysitting im an authority

captains log supplemental we are approaching the class m planet where we hope to find the other colonists

signal from the planet captain
on screen this is jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise representing the united federation of planets
this is wonderful welcome captain im wilson granger prime minister of mariposa
no doubt a descendant of captain walter granger
not quite a descendant we feared earth had suffered some catastrophe when no one came back to check on us
im afraid the truth is you got lost in the bureaucracy but despite the lateness of our arrival were here now and were eager to renew ties
splendid please come down and allow us to extend our hospitality to you and your crew
thank you form an away team number one
i would urge caution
caution whats wrong
hes hiding something
well check it out mister worf doctor pulaski join us in transporter room three for an away detail


welcome to mariposa im victor granger minister of health
commander william riker doctor pulaski lieutenant worf
a pleasure ill escort you to the prime minister this way please
twin brothers
your arrival really is serendipitous
oh how so
well perhaps ill let the prime minister to explain that

triplets worf there is something damn odd down here

quadruplets

doctor is your title scientific or medical
medical
ah excellent
is there some medical problem we should know about
i think it best if the er
prime minister explains that somehow i thought you might
yes excuse me gentlemen please follow me

this way please doctor

welcome to mariposa
doctor katherine pulaski
this is my chief of staff elizabeth vallis
tell me is your entire population made up of clones prime minister
clones
clones
clones
captains log supplemental prime minister granger has requested an urgent meeting to discuss the future of the mariposan colony ive invited him to the enterprise

captain we need your help three hundred years ago during our landing on mariposa the skin of our ship was breached only five of the colonists survived the progenitors werent willing to just give up and die and they were scientists
so they used that expertise and turned to cloning
yes we had no other option two women and three men represented an insufficient gene pool from which to build a society
how did you suppress the natural sexual drive drugs punitive laws
in the beginning a little bit of each now after three hundred years the entire concept of sexual reproduction is a little repugnant to us
how did you overcome the problem of replicative fading
we havent
you have got a problem
wait i dont understand replicative fading
each time you clone youre making a copy of a copy subtle errors creep into the chromosomes and eventually you end up with a nonviable clone
how can we help you
we need an infusion of fresh dna i was hoping that you would be willing to share some tissue samples
you want to clone us
yes
no way not me
how can you possibly be harmed
its not a question of harm one william riker is unique perhaps even special but a hundred of him a thousand of him diminishes me in ways i cant even imagine
you would be preserving yourself
human beings have other ways of doing that we have children
i think you will find that attitude prevalent among all the enterprise people
i see well if you are not willing to share your dna will you at least send some people to repair our malfunctioning equipment
yes of course number one put a technical team together lets get these repairs underway
yes sir lieutenant la forge prepare a technical support away team meet me in transporter room three

captain with your permission i would like to return to the planet it could be my last opportunity to study replicative fading with your permission of course mister prime minister
youd be most welcome perhaps you will find a solution that we have overlooked
well i appreciate the compliment but i dont think thats very likely and repairing that equipment will certainly not solve your problems
what other solution do we have doctor remember there are only five of us
captains log supplemental commander riker and doctor pulaski have returned to mariposa with a team of enterprise technicians

the repairs are almost complete i wish there was something more we could do
are you sure you wont reconsider
about the cloning
yes
out of the question

excuse me sir i was looking for commander riker
im afraid i havent seen him
doctor pulaski
sorry i cant help you
well i guess ill just have to hunt for them sorry to disturb you



hey so what happened to you two down on mariposa is everything all right
is there any reason why it shouldnt be
yeah every time i asked where you were some clone lied to me
lied to you
commander with this i can see better than your average person now when someone lies there are certain physical manifestations variations in blush response pupil dilation pulse breath rate doesnt always work with aliens but humans gotem nailed
the clones lied about our whereabouts i dont remember anything happening i was working in their medical facility and got a call to report to grangers office i ran into will on the way
now wait a minute granger said he hadnt seen either one of you did you make it to his office
i think i dont remember

so whats the prognosis doc
geordi youll be pleased to know that youre not missing any epithelial cells
great
will and i however are
meaning
although you can clone from any cell in the body the cells lining the stomach are the best choice because theyre relatively undifferentiated
where are you going
to their cloning lab


stop murderers
like hell youre a damn thief
gentlemen please
what else could we do we asked for your help and you refused us were desperate desperate
and that gave you the right to assault us to rob us
we have the right to survive

doctor how desperate is the colonys situation
theyve got two or three generations then the fading will be terminal theyre among the walking dead now they just havent been buried
i want the cloning equipment inspected who knows how many tissue samples were stolen we certainly have a right to exercise control over our own bodies
youll get no argument from me
i know the mariposan culture seems alien even frightening but really we do have much in common theyre human beings fighting for survival would we do any less
are you saying we should give them the dna samples they require
thats just postponing the inevitable if they get an infusion of fresh dna in fifteen generations theyll just go back to the same problems cloning isnt the answer what they need is breeding stock
the bringloidi
yes they have the energy and drive and the clones possess the emotional maturity and the technological knowledge
they started out together it seems only fitting they should end up together
its a match made in heaven
unfortunately it will have to be a shotgun wedding

im sorry captain its out of the question youre trying to dump your problems on us we have problems of our own
dont you understand the bringloidi can help you
look at him how could we ever integrate that into our society
youre no prize yourself
primitive hostile disruptive it would require enormous effort to even educate them
oh forget it captain picard im not going to come in here with my hat in my hand begging charity from this blatherskite
now stop i will not allow posturing and bigotry to destroy this meeting now please sit down now commander riker has asked that your laboratories be inspected for stolen tissue samples and i understand his concern we may have to transport all your equipment here to the enterprise
i see when reason fails youll resort to blackmail
fine destroy yourselves
its not so bad captain in fifty years well have a new class m planet complete with cities and ready for colonisation
you see the end is closer than you like to think
i dont know there are so many difficulties
look man we are decent hard working people were willing to learn
theyre so different
it is the differences that have made us strong
for three hundred years we have denied the carnal side of our nature how can we learn to put that aside
well you put a young couple together and you let nature take its course
now if this is going to work youre going to have to alter your society too monogamous marriage will not be possible for several generations
i dont quite understand
thirty couples are enough to create a viable genetic base but the broader the base the healthier and the safer the society so it will be best if each woman bringloidi and mariposan had at least three children by three different men
i think i could handle that yes
oh god its so
frightening
repugnant
so its a done deal and heres my hand on it  right now lets go and stake out my three women send in the clones
i must be out of my mind
starfleet will probably agree with you

excuse me sir captain thank you brenna brenna a word

isnt that just like a man you make these grandiose decisions but you never stop to consider the poor women
miss odell i
you men draw a mug and solve all the problems of the world while the beer goes down but when it comes to the practical matters it always falls to the women to make your grand dreams come true
miss odell you were the one who wanted a new home
but i dont know if i want to be eve
its your choice if you wish you can stay on the enterprise we will drop you at a starbase then you can go where you wish
leave my da
if this is going to work these people will need your strength your guidance
oh damn what does he do again
prime minister
sounds important
oh it is
sounds like he might have more than two coins to rub together three husbands
manhunt

captains log stardate  we are in orbit around antede three awaiting the arrival of two dignitaries our mission is to escort them to a conference on planet pacifica where they will be given the opportunity to join the federation


i thought you might find this interesting mister crusher few humans have ever seen an antedean in the flesh

welcome im jeanluc picard captain of the enterprise
are they alright captain
yes this is their preferred way of space travel
their physical condition is good enough considering the circumstances
it is a selfinduced catatonic state their way of dealing with the trauma of spaceflight
will we try to revive them
no not until we reach the pacifica conference three days from now doctor have you prepared a sickbay facility to accommodate our guests
as soon as i can make some adjustments their physiology is unusual you can store them for a few hours
sure ill have them kept out of the way here
mister worf provide security
aye sir

whats in that container
vermicula its their food when they come out of stasis theyll be very hungry

they eat this
in great quantities
what a handsome race

so what did you think of the antedeans wesley
they are rather strangelooking commander
judging a being by its physical appearance is the last major human prejudice wesley
your point is well taken mister data im sure that to the antedeans we are equally unattractive
captain we are being hailed by a small transport vessel just coming into range
oh my god
whats the problem
whats she doing here
on screen captain
starship enterprise come in
we have you on our viewer pilot
enterprise i have a passenger a vip passenger who im ordered to
oh let me talk to them im sure im more articulate than that
mother
captain we are receiving starfleet orders granting a lwaxana
lwaxana troi daughter of the fifth house holder of the sacred chalice of rixx heir to the holy rings of betazed
full ambassadorial status sir
it looks like its back into that dress uniform sir
and yours as well commander she is listed as representing the betazed government at the conference
mother please dont do this to me
do what to you little one oh jeanluc what naughty thoughts but how wonderful you still think of me like that

its so like my mother to do the unexpected
it will be pleasant to have her as a guest of the enterprise again energise

legs where are the legs
where they belong mother right under you
oh i hate that i will never completely trust this device jeanluc
captain picard mother

aaagh
explain to her
im sorry they startled you mrs troi theyre antedean delegates theyre being stored here temporarily
delegates last time i saw something like that it was being served on a plate darling well well well and you jeanluc i wasnt aware you had such handsome legs my valet is waiting you may beam him aboard now
you remember mister homn of course
it would be hard to forget mister homn
i retain his services despite the outlandishly lustful thoughts he spews in my direction you can put that down homn we cant deny the captain the honour of carrying my belongings
i will not interfere with homns duties this time
thats not what youre really thinking jeanluc you forget im a telepath
mrstroi since this obviously significant to you ill  ill carry it

just down this corridor
he has nice legs too little one is he still yours
humans no longer own each other that way mother
really thats a custom we may have to introduce again

thank you
glad to help

well i trust you will be comfortable here if you will excuse me
i am be serving a betazoid dinner of greeting tonight captain it is an ambassadorial function
it sounds delightful

hes a fine man solid reliable hes a little on the stuffy side but all in all hes not that bad
i cant believe you mother you sound like youre sizing up a commodity
but thats exactly what men are darling especially human men was your father ever unhappy with me
no he worshipped you but i dont think ill ever learn to see men the way you do
you will as you mature darling and the men in your life are going to bless you for it youre so beautiful

and she actually complimented captain picard on his legs
i would have thought a telepath would be more discreet sir
exactly the opposite she knows whats in your mind and she lets you know whats on hers
gentlemen i think we must not lose sight of the fact that were talking about someone who has been granted ambassadorial rank even though she may appear somewhat eccentric lwaxana troi must be treated with the appropriate respect is that understood picard to pulaski
yes captain
when did you last time you look in on the antedean guests

doing so right now captain
are they still catatonic
status of the beings is unchanged pulse still steady respiration normal for them

understood keep me informed picard out ill be in my quarters it will be a dress uniform dinner gentlemen
sir

to which dinner was the captain referring sir
nothing ive been invited to any of you very interesting


doctor youre not attending the dinner with the rest of us this evening
ive already eaten but thanks captain


i seem to be a little early im sure the others will be here soon the other officers commander riker counsellor troi

hello jeanluc so glad you could come

a toast to earthmen who despite their faults have that unique ability to charm women of all races in all corners of the galaxy
speaking on behalf of men of earth which is indeed an awesome responsibility i thank you
i know what youre thinking captain
you do
youre wondering whether im seeing any other man on a serious basis
well actually i wasnt
i wouldnt worry about it jeanluc competition seems to bring out the best in the human male
the fact is i wasnt expecting this setting i had assumed that my senior bridge officers would be attending
you never assume anything where lwaxana troi is concerned betazoid women are full of surprises strange im not really very hungry tonight i wonder whats made me lose my appetite any ideas

of course youre giving thanks for your food id forgotten about that i wonder how many other cultures have similar customs
i dont know
well lets find out commander data
yes captain
mrs troi and i are having a very interesting discussion about various societies ways of giving thanks the betazoid use of the chime for instance
the use of the chime is unique but not at all dissimilar to the

ooolans of marejaretus six who use two large stones which are continuously struck during the meal those at the dinner must eat until the stones are broken

or the oligarchy on atifs four which require a young
data this is fascinating dont you agree mrs troi commander if your duties permit why dont you join us for dessert im sure that mrs troi would much appreciate the pleasure of your company
what

indeed sir im on my way data out

how could you possibly think i would want to share our special time together with that that robot of yours
because of datas wonderful afterdinner conversation his anecdotes are the stuff of legends aboard this ship

so by using the square root of pi and multiplying it by nine to the third power i was able to accurately calculate the distance between the omicron system and the crab nebula
fascinating data absolutely fascinating im sure mrs troi would love to hear the one about the anomalous chemical composition of brown dwarf stars
not really
yes captain that is a particularly spellbinding subject in most stars the rare earth element europium is enriched relative to samarium and gadolinium
is that so
it is however

your mother seems quite an interesting woman deanna
perhaps i should tell you something about my mothers condition at this time
condition at this time
its something that occurs to betazoid females as they enter midlife we call it the phase
midlife as in a human females menopause
similar its only at midlife that a betazed female becomes well fully sexual if you know what i mean
yes i think i do i also think that i saw the captain on his way to her quarters
i wonder if i shouldnt warn him
no as ships doctor id consider it excellent exercise for his reflexes and agility
doctor 
for staying ahead of your mother
yes an animal is always at its best when hunted
or when hunting


and at this point the second coorbital satellite avoids a collision with the first

deanna darling thank the four deities youre here
i hope im not interrupting
no i must as a matter of fact be getting back to the bridge
captain perhaps i should remain and further entertain our guest
no i mean im sure youre needed on the bridge as well
well thank you for a delicious meal we must do this again sometime
i know we will

well little one the captain is every bit as charming as your father was

data you will never know just how much i owe you for that
indeed captain i know many more interesting anecdotes sir for example
data
sir
later
yes sir

why would you come aboard at a time like this
i had no choice i was going to pacifica you were going to pacifica
dont be absurd mother you knew what would happen

what stage is it in
i have it completely under control
what stage is it in
well far enough along for me to enjoy it little one
now i know why you wore that dress
dont be ridiculous this simple little dress nothing provocative about it
what are we going to do
im going to do the only honourable thing there is to do and id say your captain has the inside track
mother dont even think it
why not he was thinking about it all through dinner

i was what i tell you deanna for a telepath your mothers accuracy leaves much to be desired
actually her telepathic prowess is quite advanced except for now
except for now
dont misunderstand me counsellor your mother is a beautiful person
my mother is beginning a physiological phase its one that all betazoid women must deal with as they enter midlife
yes its something troi warned me about when we first started to see each other a betazoid woman when she goes through this phase quadruples her sex drive
or more
or more you never told me that
i didnt want to frighten you she has opted for the only dignified option open to her
isolation
she has decided to focus all of her sexual energy on one male who will of course eventually become her husband it seems captain that you are the early favourite
congratulations sir
im not amused number one there must be some way to convince her that its quite impossible without offending her
you cannot apply human style logic to this captain a betazoid woman in the phase would be shocked and deeply resentful should you spurn any such advances she would take it personally
well under the circumstances i think it would be prudent if i were to make myself less available for the duration of this journey
agreed

im afraid so mother
oh well he was too old for me anyway homn perhaps we should consider my alternate plan
alternate plan
you worry too much little one your mother has the situation well in hand

thank you

youre through ducking me hill
computer freeze programme variations on a theme computer perhaps i am not clearly defining my intent
the flexibility of the programme is limited to the parameters of the dixon hill novels
yes of course

even in this state they possess a certain dignity a graceful countenance
if you say so lieutenant
i see is this how you felt when you first saw me
well maybe at first a little but now that ive seen more klingons ive come to think youre handsome for a klingon that didnt quite come out the way i meant sir

i still say they look better in sauce when will the good captain revive them
not until we reach pacifica maam
you seem a fine boy one day youll grow up to be a big strong man but im afraid i cannot afford to wait for you to mature now thats more like it your thoughts theyre primal savage i like that in a man
i am not a man
which is in your favour men so often being irrational and egotistical but unfortunately ive grown accustomed to human companionship pity youd have made a fine choice well whos next mister homn

ah yes lets do it im not getting any younger

what was that all about

so madeline ill see you later activate programme
leaving dix youre not to rexs bar are you
rexs bar why do you ask
its one of the messages i left on your desk
that sounds like an excellent idea would you care to join me
me have a drink with you
why not
there aint no why not about it its just that this is the first time you ever asked
is that a problem
not for me but youd better take this 
why
because if were going to rexs bar youre gonna need it


hey dix what do you know and what do you say see this  germanys getting ready to invade england
whos going to stop them
somebodyd better
just as long as it isnt us the last thing america needs to do is fight in another world war
actually the second world war although disastrous did end with the united states taking its place as a dominant world power and cultural influence in the second half of the twentieth century additionally that war was a catalyst of technological advancement developments in rocketry and fission resonate on into the twenty fourth century
i dont know if i should pour you one dix sounds like youve got a snootful already
whats this
the usual
ah now let me see that would be scotch neat
what else

and for the lady
rye and ginger

money i keep forgetting the need to carry money i must remember not to let this happen again
right i dont mind you being on the cuff but youre up the sleeve halfway to my collar
is that why you wanted to see me about my bar bill
no its on account of jimmy cuzzo
jimmy cuzzo i know that name
hes why i gave you the gun
what was the name of that case he was involved in the parrots claw
jeez dix cuzzos the guy who iced marty ofarron they never would have nailed him if it hadnt been for you your testimony got him arraigned
yeah yours and mine
so you brought me here because you didnt want to face him alone
i dont want to face him at all im hoping that seeing us together will slow him up long enough to get some things straight
and if it doesnt
then you just have to kill him

bridge this is doctor pulaski

weve just completed the transfer the antedeans are now in sickbay
acknowledged doctor

mother what are you doing here you cant just stroll on to the bridge whenever you feel like it
i didnt just stroll on dear i took the turbo tube or whatever you call it the captains not here
he is busy elsewhere maam
i have other interests as well
youre scheming something mother dont try to fool me i can tell
youre always so melodramatic little one im not scheming im deciding
mother not him
and why not him hes adorable


pulaski to bridge
riker here
the antedeans are coming around they are currently in the early stages of post hibernation

how long until theyre fully conscious
id guess it to be a matter of hours now
very well ill inform the captain if youll excuse me maam
youre going to see the captain but i thought he was tied up on ships business
in a manner of speaking he is im not going to be disturbing him ill just give him the message
excellent timing then you may also inform him about us
us
you dont mind if i let our ships crew know first do you william friends dear friends you are all invited to a prestigious occasion on the planet pacifica
no
there on the shores of the western sea in a traditional betazoid ceremony your commander riker and i will be joined in the union of matrimony
married
until death us do part
mrs troi i dont know how to tell you this
i know how you feel dear youre overwhelmed with excitement believe me i understand well talk about the details later right now there are preparations to be made

why did you stop me someone needs to set her straight
i think ill leave that to the captain
coward
commander are you planning on going into the holodeck
i thought i might would you like to join me
could you postpone our departure for just five minutes sir
no problem

you said you had responsibilities what exactly did you mean
you know about my mothers cousin the girl from san antonio i told you about

jimmy

im as jumpy as haircut lapinski trying to land on a fraction
sorry to bother you captain
captain
call me dix
sorry to bother you dix but our two passengers have awakened
then its time for me to go
what about jimmy cuzzo you cant leave rex to face him alone
ill be back before jimmy cuzzo arrives i guarantee it will be taken care of just relax
your friendsve got time for one drink havent they dix
oh yes of course one more round these are my associates this is nails from chicago and this is
carlos
from south america this is madeline my secretary and i want you to meet rex you know i dont think i ever heard your last name
hm dont think i have one just rex thats all so fellas tell me your troubles
well troubles weve got some captain it seems that a certain woman both wealthy and beautiful now thinks that that shes going to marry me
shes got looks and bucks sounds like youve got yourself a heck of a deal

my fianc just has to see how i look in this come along homn

hello computer is commander riker still on the bridge
negative riker is currently in holodeck three
holodeck where is that
follow the comm panel lights they will lead you there

good god whats that

ill bet thats the broad with the big bucks come on over here darlin i got the best stool in the house saved for you
so this is where youve been hiding jeanluc im surprised you let this part of the ship get this dirty oh relax commander youve been making your true feelings quite clear obviously you feel unable to handle me
anyway why would a beautiful highclass lady like yourself want to hook up with a mug like that youre too good for him if you ask me
you are a very interesting person
youre not so bad yourself in fact youre as much class as this joints ever seen here on the house its french almost
this is the most remarkable man i have never met anyone quite like him
i dont suppose you have
hes strong i get no thoughts from him at all nothing ive never known a man so able to keep his true feelings completely hidden
thats because
no man has ever been such a mystery to me i usually know their thoughts before they do
but not with me huh
no and i never realised how erotic that could be carry my beverage to that table we have some things to discuss
should we tell her
i think it would be only fair but lets allow her the moment

food food food food food
worf the vermicula

pulaski to captain picard
go ahead doctor
our passengers are on their feet

understood
id better get to the bridge
whats their condition

hungry would you like to be shown to your rooms

are you coming mrs troi
not just yet tell william im sorry but rex and i are getting married
mrs troi your government expects us to deliver you to the conference on time and thats what i intend to do
pity duty calls darling but ill be back for you later
mrs troi there is something you ought to know about rex
oh


imagine allowing me to go on like that with that man who doesnt even exist
but you always say you like surprises mother

why are they still here
we thought that since youre going to the same conference you might like to beam down with the other delegates
theyre not delegates those two are assassins
that is an outrage lies we demand you transport at once
dont bother to deny it your minds are so unsophisticated i can read your thoughts in my sleep their robes are lined with ultritium highly explosive virtually undetectable by your transporter
she is correct sir i am detecting large amounts of ultritium
well of course you are they were planning on blowing up the entire conference
mister worf take them to level five disarm them hold them for questioning
aye sir
ah well i didnt find a mate but i did save the conference as well as your reputations all in a days work i suppose
goodbye mrs troi and thank you energise chief obrien
 jeanluc shame on you for thinking such a thing
the emissary



looking good ill go five
five here
and five more
i believe the wiser course of action here is to bend
you mean fold data
that is correct fold to bend to make compact or to capitulate
i raise fifty
i do not believe lieutenant worf understands all the nuances of this betting procedure
i wouldnt be so quick to judge data his piles a lot bigger than yours
than any of ours
the cards have been favouring the lieutenant but that is the result of random chance therefore a temporary condition
you hope
talk or play not both
fifty right
fifty is the bet whats the matter feet getting cold
my cards are getting cold here you go
im glad you stayed in i need the chips
talk talk talk
okay heres the action fifty and another fifty
ouch fold fold fold
your fifty and fifty more
love to play but not with these cards
looks like its just us handsome ill see you

beats my straight
the iceman wins again
you took my last chip you could at least smile worf
smiling would break his concentration
your deal
 geordi

the game is seven card stud after the queen oneeyed jacks and low card in the hole are wild
wait a minute let me write this down

i open with fifty
bridge to commander riker were receiving a class eleven emergency signal from starfleet command
on my way
fifty you were bluffing
klingons never bluff
yeah right

mister data
emergency signal reads as follows enterprise to divert to coordinates fourtwothree by one one two by five one immediately further orders forthcoming
thats it whats the emergency
the message does not elaborate
youd think theyd at least give us a hint
course laid in captain
warp eight whenever starfleet gets enigmatic i know were about to face a challenge engage
our destination is a point near the boradis system
that area was colonized fairly recently as i recall
the first federation outpost was established thirty four years ago on boradis three
since then the federation has colonised several planets in that sector
yet we are not headed for a specific colony the coordinates given are outside the boradis system
any problems reported in that area
none sir
what the devil is going on
captain starfleet command is hailing us
about time on screen

greetings captain picard
my compliments admiral gromek
captain you will soon be joined by a federation special emissary from starbase one five three we are now transmitting the specifics
we are receiving sir
the rendezvous will be a bit tricky so it is imperative you reach the intercept point on schedule
understood and the mission
the envoy will fill you in you are to cooperate fully
admiral can you give me any details
negative
admiral its a little difficult to prepare for a mission i know nothing about
i sympathise jeanluc but starfleet command considers this a top security matter once the envoy has briefed you i think you will understand our caution gromek out
data what ship is carrying the envoy
apparently there were no starships available on starbase one five three the envoy is aboard a class eight probe
a class eight probe is just over two metres long
yes thats true number one but if the transmitters and the sensors were removed and lifesupport installed there would be just enough room for one person
and it is designed to travel at warp nine
by sending the probe to meet us rather than diverting the enterprise they are saving us six point one hours
obviously starfleet feels that time is of the essence
but still to seal someone inside a class eight probe and launch it off its a hell of a way to transport a federation dignitary
 coming to three one mark one one three i
we are on a course precisely parallel to the probe sir
increase speed to warp eight point nine
eight point nine aye
full sensors aft
scanning
data if we project our course beyond the rendezvous coordinates what lies ahead
as far as i can determine sir very little there are four colonies in the boradis system as well as nine other outposts scattered throughout the sector
i have it sir bearing zero five mark two three one velocity warp nine
i see it
adjust speed to intercept
probe is coming up to starboard range eighty two hundred tractor beam ready
mister la forge

transporter ready captain

range now seventy five hundred
steady as she goes
probe is standing abeam
engage tractor
transporter beam locked captain
energise


probe aboard captain

acknowledged number one
ill welcome our visitor
resume original course and speed
aye sir


all yours commander

something wrong doctor
im not sure the readings are quite interesting

i greet you i am kehleyr
nuqneh qaleghnes
you speak klingon
a little i am commander william riker this is chief medical officer katherine pulaski i hope your voyage wasnt too unpleasant
klingons are not supposed to mind hardship nonetheless i am delighted to be out of that damned coffin
i dont blame you its not the most luxurious accommodation starfleet has to offer
whoever said that getting there was half the fun never rode in a class eight probe
how are you feeling your vital signs are rather atypical for a klingon
no doubt because i am only half klingon
oh
yes my father was klingon my mother was human


captain allow me to present special federation emissary kehleyr
welcome aboard im jeanluc picard this is counsellor troi lieutenant commander data and this is lieutenant
worf so this is where youve been hiding i told you wed meet again arent you going to greet me
i have nothing to say to you
havent changed a bit well i missed you too two days ago starbase three three six received an automated transmission from a klingon ship the tong that ship was sent out over seventy five years ago
when the federation and the klingon empire were still at war
the message was directed to the klingon high command it said only that the ship was returning home and was about to reach its awakening point
which suggests that the crew had been in cryogenic sleep for that long journey
exactly
and when this crew is revived
well have a ship full of klingons who think the war is still going on
so our task is to find the ship and tell the klingons theyre no longer at war
why us wouldnt a klingon ship be a better choice
a klingon ship the prang is on its way but its two days behind us that may be too late
why too late
when the tong crew awakens it will be within striking range of several federation outposts
there are thirteen colonies with minimal defences in that sector
nice ripe targets for a klingon warship
and you believe you can convince these klingons that the humans are now their allies
no not a chance if you ask me talking will be a waste of time klingons of that era were raised to despise humans well try diplomacy but i promise you it wont work and then youll have to destroy them
no
no captain these klingons are killers youll have no choice
we shall find another choice i want options and i want them before we encounter the klingon ship lieutenant im assigning you to help the emissary dismissed
i will escort you to the guest quarters
captain

lieutenant
sir i suggest commander riker or data would better serve special emissary kehleyr
are there any personal reasons you dont want the assignment
yes
any professional reasons
no  i withdraw my request captain
good

i didnt know it was possible for a human and a klingon to produce a child
actually the dna is compatible with a fair amount of help rather like my parents
i know exactly what you mean my father was human and my mother is a betazoid
really it was the other way around for me my mother was human you mustve grown up like i did trapped between cultures
i never felt trapped i tried to experience the richness and diversity of the two worlds
perhaps you got the best of each

myself i think i got the worst of each
oh i doubt that
oh yes having my mothers sense of humour is bad enough its gotten me into plenty of trouble
and your klingon side
that i keep under tight control its like a terrible temper its not something i want people to see
everyone has tempers
not like mine sometimes i feel theres a monster inside of me fighting to get out
and it frightens you
of course it does my klingon side can be terrifying even to me
it gives you strength its a part of you
that doesnt mean i have to like it


you are late
sorry had to make myself beautiful
i fail to understand why
worf were alone now you dont have to act like a klingon glacier i dont bite well thats wrong i do bite
shall we proceed with our assigned duties
you werent this aloof six years ago or dont you remember
there is nothing wrong with my memory
well theres something wrong with the rest of you youre not even looking at me
i am familiar with your appearance
and it gives you no pleasure to see me again it isnt as if we tried it and it didnt work you know you never gave it a chance
i never
i mean as i see it we have some unfinished business you and i
not as far as im concerned according to the library computer the captain of the tong is ktemoc but there is nothing regarding the ships mission
probably some secret military objective
perhaps but we have no evidence of that
why else would there be no record of the mission
the records may simply have been lost
what does it matter our concern is the present the possible threat
and to contend with that threat we need information
we have all the information we need
that is foolish knowing their mission might help us understand them
there is nothing to understand these are klingons theyll attack in their minds were the enemy and theres no way were going to talk them out of that
and i do not appreciate being interrupted
and i do not appreciate wasting my time
we were instructed to come up with options
there arent any the assignments hopeless
there are always options
oh are there tell me whatever happened to that wonderful klingon fatalism of yours
my experiences aboard this ship have taught me that most problems have more than one solution
starfleet hasnt improved you one bit youre as stubborn as ever
are you going to carry out your duties or arent you
all right i will upon due consideration of the problem and careful examination of all possible options my original recommendation stands meeting adjourned


come

youre upset
your finelyhoned betazoid sense tells you that
well that and the table
i warned you about my klingon half
may i make a suggestion
i thank you counsellor but i dont want any counseling
actually i was going to suggest something else
oh
i find the exercise programs on the holodeck rigorous enough to put my mind off most frustrations
and itll keep me from wrecking the ship
that too


enter programme
show me the exercise menu hold calisthenics programme of lieutenant worf
programme complete you may enter when ready



status mister data
based on the last assumed position of the klingon vessel its apparent trajectory and our estimates of their cruising speed we should be in scanner range in fifteen hours eight minutes

lieutenant
special emissary kehleyr has declared a short recess sir i wish to run a full diagnostic test on all tactical backup equipment
we just ran a full test of those systems
i feel it necessary to check them again
lieutenant i commend your diligence however im concerned that youre working yourself too hard
sir considering the unknown elements we are about to face
lieutenant i order you to relax
i am relaxed yes sir

ive never before seen the lieutenant so unsettled
the icemans finally melting



its not much of a programme
computer level two

some calisthenics programs are better than others
you still can make jokes
you dont like people with a sense of humour
i did not say that
worf youre the perfect klingon the ultimate minimalist talk to me
ive noted that some people use humour as a shield they talk much yet say little
whereas others take a simpler approach say nothing
when one does not have the words
or is loath to speak them why didnt we do this six years ago
we were not ready
i was
no we were both too young too unaware we lacked commitment
perhaps we lacked courage as well
no longer tlhingan jih
wait you cant mean
we are mated
yes i know i was there but
and now we must solemnise our union with the oath
im not going to become your wife
you already are
dont give me that klingon nonsense
you would dishonour our sacred traditions
theyre not sacred theyre absurd marrying you is out of the question for a million reasons
none of which stopped you earlier
worf it was what it was glorious and wonderful and all that but it doesnt mean anything
that is a human attitude
i am human
you are also klingon
so that means we should bond for life
it is our way
yours not mine
tlhingan jih
i will not take the oath
then this night had no meaning and that i will not believe
believe what you will

approaching the coordinates
slow to impulse
short and longrange sensor scans negative captain
lay in a standard search pattern
search pattern laid in
full impulse engage
i hope we find them before they come out of their nap
agreed theres not an outpost in this area could defend itself against a klingon warship


ive been working on our assignment trying a few computer simulations
your devotion to duty is commendable if belated
unwilling to be alone with me
i asked lieutenant commander data to help us analyse the alternatives
an android chaperon
android of course is correct but i fail to see how chaperon is applicable in this situation
never mind i guess i cant blame you tell me one thing you would have gone through with the oath wouldnt you regardless of the consequences to our careers to our lives
honour demanded no less
what do you want is honour all you care about dont you feel anything else no comment huh poor android whose behaviour do you find more perplexing human or klingon
at the moment i would find it difficult to choose
so would i okay when we locate the tong there are two possibilities first

we find the ship before it reaches the awakening point in that case we simply keep the crew asleep
is that feasible
we can beam an away team onto the tong and override the cryogenic controls sure
then we await the arrival of the klingon ship prang
so that when the tongs crew awakens theyre surrounded by their fellow klingons
that would be ideal
but theres the second possibility that the crew of the tong has already revived
they realise theyre in federation territory and attack the nearest outpost
they could have been on a scientific voyage
klingons of that ear doing research for its own sake
the point is they may be reasonable
the point is that this is beside the point these are klingons at war with us whatever their mission was once they see a federation target theyll attack
could the tong be disabled rather than destroyed
we could probably knock out their warp drive engines without damaging the rest of their ship
that would gain you nothing disable the ship and ktemoc will destroy it himself
klingons do not surrender
if we dont reach the tong before its crew wakes up you have no alternatives
i cant not accept that there must be some way that we can make the klingons listen if we can only convince them
captain we are detecting a ship

bearing three onesix mark four two

extreme sensor range
lay in intercept course go to yellow alert

shields are up
better lock in phasers this may be the only chance you get
intercept course laid in
hold this position lets see if theyve spotted us magnification one hundred mister data
sensors show life forms aboard but i am unable to ascertain whether they are awake or dormant however the vessels propulsion systems are inactive so i would hypothesize that the crew is asleep

however i could be in error
shields holding
theyve cloaked themselves
well captain youve had your chance

transferring engineering to the bridge
can you find them
i think so those old shields werent particularly efficient at blocking gamma ray output if i can tune the sensors to a particular band of there got them transferring coordinates to helm
intercept warp two
warp two sir
captain let them die like klingons in battle they deserve that much
captain i have another option
captains log stardate  despite their cloaking shields we have located the klingon vessel tong in an effort to avoid further confrontation were about to implement the option presented by lieutenant worf

the tong has changed course to three two mark eight one increasing to warp three
standard evasive manoeuvre
helm stay with them
yes sir
the tong is now on a heading of four two mark one one three they are accelerating to warp five
theyre going to make a break for it
overtake warp eight
aye
now put us right in their path and come to a full stop full power to shields
full power sir
well weve thrown down the gauntlet lets see if they pick it up
they are slowing to impulse sir

phaser hit on forward shields firming up now no damage
i guess weve piqued their interest now
agreed lets give them the chance to look their enemy in the face ready lieutenant
open hailing frequencies
open sir
what what is this

captain ktemoc have you lost your mind halt your vessel and drop your shields
what treachery is this by whose authority
i am worf commanding the enterprise and it is you who have committed an act of treason by firing upon this ship
i have standing orders to fire on all federation ships
you fool did it not occur to you that the war would be over by now
i have no proof of that
trust your eyes or is your brain still stuck in its long slumber
how do i know this is not a federation trick how can i be sure
captain as you are new to this century i have tried to be patient but i will tolerate no further insubordination drop your shields immediately
and if i refuse
then die in ignorance i can waste no more time on you phasers to full power
aye sir phasers ready target locked
you dare not destroy us we are on a crucial mission by order of the klingon high command
has the tong dropped its shields
no sir
very well fire all phasers
wait lower the shields i yield command of the tong to you captain worf long live the klingon empire
a wise decision captain commander kehleyr will board your ship and take command the klingon cruiser prang will soon arrive and escort you home and captain
yes
welcome to the twenty fourth century

i return command of the ship to you captain
thank you lieutenant congratulations a very fine first command well done
how did you like command
comfortable chair
and you wore it well

one to beam aboard the tong
all set
i relieve you
yes lieutenant

the klingon vessel prang will rendezvous with you in three days
in the meantime ill begin the assimilation of these klingons to our era
is there anything else you require
no nothing else damn you worf youd let me go without saying another word wouldnt you
what needs to be said
nothing everything were about to go our separate ways again
and that disturbs you
i hid the truth from you last night did have meaning i was tempted to take the oath with you but it scared me ive never had such strong feelings toward anyone
nor have i
then it was more than just a point of honour maybe someday when our paths cross again i wont be as easy to get rid of
kehleyr i will not be complete without you
peak performance

captains log stardate  despite misgivings i have agreed to starfleets request that the enterprise divert to the braslota system to take part in a war game exercise joining us as observer and mediator is the zakdorn master strategist sirna kolrami


mister kolrami captain jeanluc picard welcome aboard
captain i bring greetings from those at starfleet command
would you care to be shown to your quarters
i require little rest captain i prefer that we commence with our mission

despite their reputations this zakdorn does not appear to be a very formidable warrior
in the game of military brinksmanship individual physical prowess is less important than the perception of a species as a whole for over nine millennia potential foes have regarded the zakdorns as having the greatest innately strategic minds in the galaxy
so no one is willing to test that perception in combat
exactly
then the reputation means nothing


the braslota system in orbit around the second planet is the eightyyear old starcruiser hathaway he is still your first choice
commander riker will captain the hathaway
you will have forty eight hours to ready your vessel before the enterprise attacks
and well experience actual battle conditions
correct engineering will disconnect the enterprises weapons and link the system with the modified laserpulse beam all hits will be recorded electronically if the computer registers damage it will act accordingly shutting down the affected areas for the appropriate repair time additional questions captain picard it is my understanding that you initially resisted starfleets request for this simulation
yes
may i know why
starfleet is not a military organisation its purpose is exploration
then why am i here
with the borg threat i decided that my officers and i needed to hone our tactical skills in a crisis situation it is prudent to have several options
i prefer brains over brawn as well i think its a waste of effort to test our combat skills its a minor province in the makeup of a starship captain
your objection is noted let us hope your distaste for the exercise will not affect your strategic abilities
mister kolrami when i agree to do something i do it do you care to surrender now captain


well number one you are allowed a complement of forty so select whom you will save of course mister data who will serve as my first officer during your absence
i had envisioned you defining the crew
on my ship the leader of an away team has total control of the mission if you want to judge leadership why not start at the beginning
very well captain

my what a charmer
doctor
captain he needs an attitude adjustment
the zakdornian culture is replete with selfassuredness and confidence seldom is it undeserved for example kolrami is a third level grand master at the game of strategema


another millimetre thats it a little more there thats excellent
lieutenant
yes commander
youve heard of the simulation aboard the hathaway
yes sir and the best of luck to you ive researched the old avidyne engines theyre archaic by our standards very touchy

anticipating the worst do you think they can be whipped into shape in forty eight hours
ive already taken the liberty of putting together a few necessities
f


enter
am i disturbing you

just finished
you know of the simulation what do you think
waste of time
its just designed to be an exercise
useless if there is nothing to lose no sacrifice then there is nothing to gain
you mean besides pride well in this case it doesnt matter i probably havent got a chance
there is always a chance
slim the hathaways most sophisticated weapon system even in a computer mockup cant hope to defeat the enterprise
well still
youre outmanned youre outgunned youre outequipped what else have you got
guile
join me
the honour is to serve

begin longrange scanning of all sectors within three light years of braslota how is your crew shaping up
its complete but i would like to request an addition
anyone in particular
with your permission i would like acting ensign crusher aboard for educational observation

thank you captain

it appears we will have some time before reaching braslota i was wondering if youd agree to play me in a game of strategema
although i am intrigued by the audacity of your request i cant fathom why you wish the encounter
i enjoy a challenge
very well an opponent of limited dimensions can often be quite diverting
thank you

so youre going to beat him
nope
well then its going to be a close one
no
but you have got a chance
nah
are you going to bother to show up
sure kolrami is the best ever at strategema just to get to play him is a privilege
other aside from your being privileged is there anything else i can look forward to
nope
this is going to be exciting


against an opponent of approximate skill strategema can last well over one thousand moves
i wouldnt bet on us being here that long
i have wagered heavily in the ships pool that you will take him past the sixth plateau
and if i dont
i will be irritated
forever curious this urge to compete
its a human response that inborn craving to gauge your capabilities through conflict
doctor there are other ways to challenge oneself
perhaps but they all lack a certain thrill
data humans sometimes find it helpful to have an outsider set the standard by which theyre judged
to avoid deceiving oneself
maybe you should challenge kolrami to strategema
why doctor
because when someone is that smug you occasionally have to deflate them just a little
yeah data id like to see your neural flex tear him down a peg
to what end
computer actuation positions for strategema ready begin
come on commander come on now
will
you can do it you can get him come on commander come on you got him you got him watch out here you go

thats it
im afraid so
but but you only made twentythree moves
yes congratulations


commander riker theres your next challenge
away team assembled and ready to transport commander
i may get over there and want to come right home
good luck number one captain
the simulation will commence in forty eight hours


there should be some emergency bridge lighting here

not good
ah youre wrong mister worf its fantastic and its ours  mister worf
sir lieutenant la forge is a superior officer the honour should be his
worf this is a battle simulation youre my tactical officer ive discussed this with geordi and we agreed you need to be at my side
besides worf if engineerings anything like the bridge im going to have my hands full

attention crew of the uss hathaway this is your captain over the next two days you might lose a lot of sleep but with your skill and your stamina well have this old lady ready to fly i want hourly progress reports from all stations riker out

nice job geordi

now what are the possibilities of warp drive
not good there are only a few dilithium fragments left in the holding clamps even if we had crystals that were intact theres no antimatter to fuel the drive
any recommendations
no sir
we havent got a prayer

would you like to transfer back

to the enterprise mister crusher
no sir

wes remember our purpose is to improvise

its the effort that counts

open

i believe the rules are understood by all
the weapons conversion lieutenant burke

 complete captain
signal received locked on
shes really been stripped down captain
the only offensive systems youll need will be simulated by computer
whats the zakdornian word for mismatch
challenge we do not whine about the inequities of life and how you perform in a mismatch is precisely what is of interest to starfleet after all when one is in the superior position one is expected to win
screen off you have the bridge mister data
aye sir

lieutenant commander data i am intrigued by your challenge doctor pulaski informed me of your desire to play a game of strategema
but i expressed no such interest
what commander data means is that he would never have asked you himself but i know hes very interested in pitting his skill against yours
play against a machine why should i wish to
i dont blame you its no fun going into a game when you know youre going to lose
but i wouldnt lose now youre no doubt going to tell me that i have to prove it to you
come on data you cant let that pass
indeed i  cannot
then you will play for the honour of your ship
the honour of the ship its your reputation thats on the line

with my knowledge of the enterprises security override we may be able to convince the sensors that an enemy ship is approaching their instruments would lie to them
if you can pull that off mister worf it might just give us the edge were looking for
 but what about the viewscreen
if i am successful the computer will project a false image of the enemy ship on the main viewscreen
so unless someone runs to a window and looks out
theyre going to fall for it


the linings still smooth we should to be able to do something with these dilithium fragments we scavenged
sure the system is functional but without antimatter what difference does it make
geordi i have to return to the enterprise
wes weve only got thirty two hours
this is important
and this isnt

attempt the routing bypass here if it works they will be surprised
where am i going to get the opticable

anywhere
captain i left an experiment running back on the enterprise may i go back and shut it down
its that important
it has to be monitored and it is my final grade in plasma physics

message from the hathaway sir
on screen
request permission for ensign crusher to reboard the enterprise
why
apparently he was so anxious to be join the away team he left a very critical experiment unattended
have you any objection
he should be escorted and have no contact with anything save his research
permission granted mister burke will you handle that
aye sir
i saw no sense in riker choosing him anyway just a noncommissioned child

i cant believe i forgot about this its a good lesson not to let excitement cloud your thinking
yeah
its very dull i spent six weeks setting this up
lot of work
oh no this is ruined
thats too bad look is this going to take much longer
im going to have to dispose of this safely its very volatile ill beam it off the enterprise and leave it particalised
fine lets just do it
ill transfer the coordinates to the transporter room




in the present context what did she mean by bust him up
in her own way doctor pulaski was instructing you to take the shortest route to victory
as opposed to what
ready begin

i cant believe it the computer beaten by flesh and blood
you advanced quite far against such a worthy opponent
thoroughly enjoyable mister data i am at your disposal for a rematch
thank you but what would be the point

how can you lose youre supposed to be infallible
obviously i am not

ensign where is commander data

he has temporarily removed himself from bridge duty sir
your crew is excellently trained captain a tribute to your leadership although i doubt their extensive preparation will be needed
why is that
i do not expect captain riker will present much of a challenge
mister kolrami may i speak with you in private

i would like to know the root of your prejudice for my first officer
captain i
mister kolrami you have been nothing but denigrating and abusive of commander riker since coming aboard this ship now i would like some explanation
having studied william rikers file prior to this assignment i have found him wanting
in what regard
his work record is exemplary but as you well know a starship captain is not manufactured he or she is born from inside from the character of the individual my interviews have revealed a man who displays circumstantially inappropriate joviality belying the seriousness of his station
dont confuse style with intent only a fool would question commander rikers dedication to starfleet and the men and women under his command he is simply the finest officer with whom i have ever served
we shall see if your faith is well founded
the test is if a crew will follow where commander riker leads his joviality is the means by which he creates that loyalty and i will match his command style with your statistics any time

shades of gray



there you are whats wrong
something jabbed me here in the calf

obrien commander rikers been injured lock on and bring him up
stand by
geordi its just
a scratch right sorry commander we cant take any chances were the first survey team to set foot on this planet we dont know what the risks are

obrien whats the hold up
the transporters detected unidentified microbes in commander rikers body

well cant the biofilter screen them out
apparently not

but doctor pulaski has been notified

acknowledged
i wasnt ready to leave here anyway

heres the biofilters analysis of the microbes
thats not much to go on
i can override and beam commander riker aboard 
no id better go down and make an evaluation there

i hope these are the right coordinates just kidding doctor i know how much you love the transporter
about as much as i love comical transporter chiefs
ready

over here doctor
fill me in
i was walking along minding my own business doing a simple geological sweep something stuck me in the leg
any pain
no just a little numb thats all
do you know what it was that stuck you
weve been looking for it no luck
well whatever it was it left something behind im going to take you up to sickbay obrien this is doctor pulaski

medical override is authorised
acknowledged

this is the strangest feeling my whole leg just went dead
captains log stardate  during a geological survey on surata four commander riker has become infected by an unidentified microbe

number one
captain
put your foot where it didnt belong
the doctor said she was getting bored i just thought id give her a challenge
that you did the commanders nervous system has been invaded by an unknown microorganism not a bacteria not a virus but with the elements of both theres the point of entry the microbes are infecting the great sciatic nerve and they are multiplying at an incredible rate there
can you remove it
not surgically the organisms fuse to the nerve intertwining at the molecular level
thats why the transporters biofilters werent able to extract it
theres no evidence of nerve damage but the organisms are impeding nervous function
my legs still asleep
prognosis
the infection is spreading it will eventually reach the brain
and if it interfered with neural activity there
commander riker could die
how can i help
i need to know more about its composition
and for that you need a sample
exactly
commander data mister la forge prepare to beam down to the planet
aye sir

i must reiterate it would be better if i went alone
dont like my company
your company is not at issue your vulnerability to the microorganism is
ill watch where i step besides how do we know that this bug doesnt like androids more than it likes humans
possible but highly unlikely in any event why risk both of us
because i know exactly where commander riker was when it happened
mister obrien energise

he was right over here
i am detecting no animal life within fifty kilometres however i am reading extensive animal remains mostly fossilised
a graveyard
i do not know
data that a look at this

the structure is rhizomatous
careful
i am always careful
it appears to be dead
im not so sure i can see thermal variations let it go for a second data lets try something perhaps it likes humans more than androids
if you are correct you are placing yourself in grave danger
im counting on those great android reflexes of yours

that must be what were looking for
i would tend to agree

stand by obrien got it energise

thanks obrien another minute and wed have been fossils ourselves
not precisely geordi true fossilisation requires several millennia
heres your sample captain
get it to sickbay right away

report
captain commander rikers injury was not accidental certain vines on the planet evidently seek out warmblooded beings and deliberately infect them
to what end
unknown sir it is conceivable there is a symbiotic relationship involved
go on
there are numerous animal remains in the area leading me to hypothesize that the vines could be predatory
vines infect animals in order to kill them
it is possible for commander rikers sake i hope my hypothesis is in error
unfortunately mister data your hypotheses rarely are

all negative
is there nothing that will cure this infection
this microorganism is very mysterious i cant even figure out whats keeping it alive
or how to kill it
oh i can kill it but not without destroying the nerves its inhabiting
i know youre doing your best doctor
my best may not be good enough

comfortable
why wouldnt i be comfortable theyre waiting on me hand and foot i hope that they dont find out that im faking it
i wish you were faking it ive seen the thorn
yes doctor showed it to me too rather harmlesslooking thing i thought
and deadly im sorry
well these things happen
when least expected
im surprised they dont happen more often after all we are exploring the unknown
and the unknown can be benign or malevolent
captain one of the things ive learned anything on these voyages on this ship and from you is that most life forms act out of an instinct for survival not out of malice
its an important lesson and i admire your lack of resentment number one
if you drop a hammer on your foot its hardly useful to get mad at the hammer

anything
not yet
what can i do
you can get out of my hair
aye aye doctor


this bug is persistent ill admit that but im not worried we rikers are ornery too as a matter of fact my great grandfather once got bit by a rattlesnake after three days of intense pain the snake died
youre a very entertaining patient
i try
yes youre making quite an effort to be cheerful
you of all people should know
you feel what anyone in your position would feel
as the first officer on this ship i have to set an example
even now
now more than ever deanna facing death is the ultimate test of character i dont want to die but if i have to id like to do it with a little pride
and a lot of impudence
you bet dying is bad enough but to lose my sense of humour forget it
imzadi
i havent given up yet

its spread to the spinal column its weakening his autonomic nervous system judging by its present rate of growth and its infiltration pattern the infection will spread to the brain within an hour
medical log stardate  i cant keep the alien infection from spreading to commander rikers brain once there it will kill him by dampening neural impulses the only way i can keep him alive is to force the neurons to stay active by stimulating them directly with electrical impulses


lets proceed

good stand by with five milligrams of tricordrazine in case of seizure here goes


the last outpost

 tasha data geordi worf anybody

weve stimulated random wave activity but the patterns are dangerously erratic
hang on will hang on
the wave patterns are still too irregular
why wont they stabilise
wait ive found the right amplitude there the patterns are steadier
is the stimulation preventing the infection from taking hold
for now the vertex waves indicate a kcomplex corresponding to an rem state
hes dreaming

encounter at farpoint holodeck

hello

marvellous how easily humans do that i still need much practice
there are some puzzles down on the planet that the captain wants answered he suggested that i take you with me on the away team ill be leading
i shall endeavour to function adequately sir
yes when the captain suggested you i looked up your record
yes sir a wise procedure sir always
then your rank of lieutenant commander is honorary
no sir starfleet class of  honours in probability mechanics and exobiology
but your files they say youre a
machine correct sir does that trouble you
to be honest yes a little
understood sir prejudice is very human
now that does trouble me do you consider yourself superior to us
i am superior sir in many ways but i would gladly give it up to be human
nice to meet you pinocchio a joke
ah intriguing
youre going to be an interesting companion mister data

the dauphin  ten forward

what should i say how do i act what do i do
guinan i need your help could you step over here a minute
sounds simple enough
now the first words out of your mouth are the most important you may want to start with something like this here you are the most beautiful woman in the galaxy but that might not work
yes yes it would
you dont know how long ive wanted to tell you that
but you were afraid
yes
of me
of us of what we might become
commander
or that you might think that was a line
maybe i do think its a line
then you think im not sincere
i didnt say that theres nothing wrong with a line its like a knock on the door
then youre inviting me in
im not sending you away
thats more than i expected
is it as much as you hoped
to hope is to recognise the possibility i had only dreams
dreams can be dangerous
not these dreams i dream of a galaxy where your eyes are stars and the universe worships the night
careful putting me on a pedestal so high you may not be able to reach me
then ill learn how to fly you are the heart in my day and the soul in my night
i dont think this is my style
shut up kid tell me more about my eyes

the icarus factor  trois office

i didnt want to leave without saying goodbye
i dont like goodbyes how about until next time
how about until next time
its been a pleasure working with you commander
the feeling is mutual counsellor
im supposed to know how everyone feels but i cant read you right now
perhaps your own feelings are getting in the way
my job is to help others sort out their emotions my own feelings are beside the point
not to me our feelings are what make us all human
are you feeling sad
yes i am
so am i

hes relaxed experiencing feelings of warmth and friendship
hes reliving memories its a natural side effect of neural stimulation look at this the organisms metabolism has changed i wonder if the stimulation is affecting them somehow im going to refocus the impulse pattern on the interpretative cortex
to intensify his memories
exactly well see if that has an effect on the microbes

justice  edo council chambers

everyone weve brought the visitors
please enjoy what we have

  bourbon street bar

gentlemen if this is what you call enhancement youve got a gift for understatement whats a knockout like you doing in a computergenerated joint like this
waiting for you
waiting for me you cant be serious
oh yes will ive never been more serious in my life

something wrong
no its just that commander rikers emotions are rather passionate
as in erotic
very much so

  bourbon street bar

a dream is that what this is is that what i am
i know you are a computergenerated image but your smell your touch the way you feel even the things you say and think seem so real
thank you
how far can this relationship go i mean how real are you
as real as you need me to be

angel one  beatas quarters

you resist dont you find me attractive
yes i find you very attractive
you attract me like no man ever has
its not my function to seduce or be seduced by the leader of another world
its not the reason
no its not but will you still respect me in the morning
i hope so

up the long ladder  rikers quarters

william is something wrong
what do you mean
do you not like girls
of course i do oh is there a technique to this foot washing
you generally start at the top and work your way down
i think i can handle that
i was hoping you might

the organisms responded all right their growth rate has doubled
then all weve done is made things worse
now we know the organisms growth rate is related to the memories hes experiencing
or the emotions that they produce
different mental processes generate different chemicals perhaps the organisms are sensitive to brain endorphins
then if some types of endorphins attract them
others will repel them im going to change the differential current pattern and see what happens

skin of evil

were not going without our shuttle crew
i warn you
enough we have people who need attention we wont hurt you but we must help them

number one
the creature attacked us lieutenant yar is down
it seems to feed on our phaser energy
we had no effect on it

whats lieutenant yars condition doctor crusher report
shes dead

the child  trois quarters

im losing life signs
you must save him
im sorry

growth rate has definitely slowed what is he feeling can you tell
sadness
which is the opposite of before and its having the opposite effect on the infection
then your theorys correct the organisms are sensitive to different types of endorphins
and negative emotions
such as sadness
produce endorphins that inhibit the organisms growth
then weve found a way to repel the infection
assuming were not too late already
how much time do we have
im not sure his vital signs are getting weaker i dont want to risk another dose of tricordrazine unless i have to i must refocus the pattern again we need to isolate memories that generate stronger negative emotions

a matter of honour  pagh bridge

i know i can count on every klingon warrior in this crew to serve and die in that battle so i ask you again commander riker where are your loyalties
i have been assigned to serve this ship and to obey your orders and i will do exactly that
will you take an oath to that effect
i just did
 do not believe him he lies
 speak in their language this is your second officer lieutenant klag
is there something you wanted to say to me lieutenant
yes sir i do not believe you
then i take it you challenge my authority over you
correct
and your position on this captain
i would say it your first command decision


conspiracy  quinns quarters

ready for your tour admiral
quite ready commander
whats in the case
actually i brought it for doctor crusher but perhaps you would like you to see it first
what is it
a form of life it was discovered accidentally by a survey team on an uncharted planet
why havent we heard anything about that
oh youll be hearing about it shortly but first there remains much scientific study to be done after all it is a superior form of life
superior
totally come have a look
i think ill summon my science officer

it wont like your science officer it does like you vitamins they do wonders for the body

riker to security guest quarters seventeen emergency


skin of evil


weve reduced the growth rate even further but not enough and his vital signs are deteriorating
but weve isolated the specific areas to stimulate the feelings were primal survival emotions
they must be producing a type of endorphin thats poisonous to the organisms
cant you intensify that emotion
i can refocus the impulse pattern even tighter but i dont know if he can withstand it hes extremely weak
do we have a choice
no if we dont neutralise the infection within half an hour hell be dead
medical log supplemental commander rikers condition is still critical ive discovered a way to reverse the infections growth rate but i may be too late

hes getting weaker isnt he
respiration shallow heartbeat extremely irregular but we cant delay any longer

symbiosis  observation lounge


you will take us to our planet and leave us there with our medicine or this person dies dont you see i have no choice we were sent to bring the felicium back the suffering on my planet is too great people are dying it doesnt matter whether were entitled to it or not we must have it
let him go
you will take us there now or give us a shuttle but we must have the medicine if you refuse this person will die
i will not be coerced
i will do it i will kill him

the last outpost


who are you


skin of evil


help data somethings got me
touch him and he dies
no no dont

enterprise

armus has enveloped commander riker
im beaming you up

if any of you leave now he dies

and so do the survivors of the crash


the growth rates down to seven percent the organisms are still impairing his neural functions respirations erratic pulse grossly irregular blood pressure almost nil tricordrazine
can we tighten the pattern further

  engineering

 recognise picard jeanluc captain recognise riker william t commander
set autodestruct sequence
does the first officer concur
yes set autodestruct sequence now
autodestruct will detonate in four minutes and fiftynine seconds

heart of glory  batris

i am korris
well handle the formalities later right now we have to get off this ship are there any others survivors
no
i believe i have found a quicker way out of here sir
check him out

he is alive sir but just barely
then pick the body and lets get out of here
no i will carry him
as you wish
come on lets go

tasha go to transporter room three i want you there when the away team returns
aye sir

commander we are out of time this ship is blowing
transporter room have you got a lock on us

too much interference you have to get farther away from the engineering section

sir the engineering section is critical destruction of the batris is imminent
theyre out of options do it

now


the growth rates almost down to zero
thats not good enough

conspiracy  room


we seek peaceful coexistence


data somethings got me

sickbay to bridge
yes doctor
weve eradicated the infection
im on my way

youre still here
i could ask you the same question
how do you feel
beat you wouldnt believe the dreams i was having
oh yes we would
youll be pleased to know that weve terminated the infection
great work doctor now if i can get out of here id like to get back
lie still i have a few dozen tests to run first
why i feel fine
there may be some residual memory loss i just want to be sure you still know who you are

of course i know who i am im captain jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise

im delighted that youre feeling better captain the admiral and i were worried about you
captain i do not believe you have the authority to promote me to the rank of admiral
the ensigns of command



captain doctor i am honoured by your presence but may i suggest you attend the second concert
why data
ensign ortiz will perform the violin part my rendition will be less enjoyable
oh
although i am technically proficient according to my fellow performers i lack soul
data telling us why youre going to fail before you make the attempt is never wise
but is not honesty always the preferred choice
excessive honesty can be disastrous particularly in a commander
indeed
knowing your limitations is one thing advertising them to a crew can damage your credibility as a leader
because you will lose their confidence
and you may begin to believe in those limitations yourself

captain were receiving a message from the sheliak corporate


origin point of the message confirmed sir it is from the shelia star system
the sheliak have not attempted to communicate with the federation for a hundred and eleven years why are they doing it now
on screen

 federation creatures there are humans on the fifth planet of tau cygna this planet was ceded to the corporate in section one hundred and thirtythree paragraph seventy seven of the treaty of armens we will begin settlement of this world in four days remove the humans
what the devil
federation creatures there are humans on the fifth planet
cancel message
tau cygna five is in the de laure belt heavy concentrations of hyperonic radiation
humans cant survive in that environment exposure to hyperonic radiation is fatal
then the sheliak are asking us to chase ghosts
no number one the sheliak havent broken a century of silence to send us after phantoms an investigation is in order set course for tau cygna five

captain human life form readings from the planet
so the sheliak werent hallucinating
numbers
impossible to get an accurate reading high levels of radiation are disrupting our sensors
hyperonic radiation also interferes with ships transporters they are now inoperable
so are the ships phasers
how can humans survive down there
they must have found a way to adapt milans work with radiation sensitivity suggests it is possible perhaps with extensive viral therapy
well whoever they are and however they survived weve got to get them off the planet
by treaty that world still belongs to the sheliak
who are within their rights to demand the removal of these trespassers
and if we dont remove them the sheliak will forcefully
how forcefully
the sheliak consider humans a lower life form they would have no compunctions about exterminating the intruders
mister data as you are unaffected by hyperonic radiation id like you to go to the planet via shuttlecraft and commence evacuation procedures
aye sir
number one any speculation on what we might find down there
my guess would be a lone survey ship maybe a dozen or so survivors


i think its some sort of shuttlecraft
wheres it from
look at the markings it must be from the federation
greetings gentlemen
we saw your ship youre the first visitor weve had in
the first visitor weve ever had
youre not human
that is correct i am an android i am lieutenant commander data of the federation starship enterprise
our greatgrandparents were citizens of the federation but you dont want to waste time talking to us
you want to speak to gosheven well take you to him
im sure the federation will be very proud of us wait until you see all weve accomplished
and who precisely is us
dont you know oh no i dont guess you would were descendants of the original settlers from the colony ship artemis

got it the artemis launched ninety two years ago destination septimus minor when they failed to check in starfleet began an extensive search
what carried the artemis

so far off course
my local informant does not have that information in the early days on tau cygna five survival was more important than history
understood how many are there
fifteen thousand two hundred fifty three sir

fifteen thousand
three days no transporters well never get them out in time
shuttles
loading all the enterprise shuttlecraft to capacity evacuation will take four weeks four days
we need more time mister data prepare the colonists for an evacuation
aye sir
get me the sheliak
their home world is quite distant captain this will take some time


gosheven look whats come
lieutenant commander data of the starship enterprise
hes an android
so he is well now that youre here what do you want
my mission is to prepare this colony for evacuation
why
because this planet belongs to the sheliak
and who is this sheliak
the term is plural the sheliak are a nonhumanoid intelligent life form classification r
well this colonys been here over ninety years weve never seen a sheliak id say that makes tau cygna five our planet
the original destination of the artemis was septimus minor
the guidance system on the artemis failed took them off course far off course our ancestors were lucky to find any place to land
and when they did the radiation started killing them
hyperonic radiation took the lives of a third of the colonists before they learned they could adapt to it
but our colony survived and prospered
look around we have brought water to the desert built a community
your accomplishments are truly remarkable yet the sheliak and the federation have a treaty which clearly makes this planet sheliak domain
then change the treaty
that may not be possible the sheliak wish to colonise this planet and are unwilling to share it with humans if you are still here when the sheliak colony ship arrives they will eradicate you
theyd kill all of us
they have little regard for human life thus the most sensible course is to prepare a contingency plan for the evacuation of your people
were not evacuating
perhaps i have not made myself clear
yes you have let me be equally clear theres going to be no evacuation youve delivered your message so go back to your ship i have work to do

nice catch wonderful reflexes sorry to test you like that but i was curious

found a new toy have we ardi
toy this is the most incredible android ive ever seen
have you seen many
actually no youre the first
only you would get this excited over a walking calculator
cybernetic intelligence fascinates me are your neural pathways duotronic
no positronic
i didnt know that was possible whats your memory capacity how many operations per second i have a million questions
im afraid i have no time to answer a million questions i have a mission to accomplish i need to know more about your people and gosheven seems unwilling to talk to me further
im ardrian mckenzie perhaps i can help you


gentlemen were giving you an assignment one thing we dont want to hear is that it is impossible
i need the transporters to function despite the hyperonic radiation
yeah but thats im yes sir

even if we get the sheliak to talk theyre not likely to be accommodating
captain when the treaty was first negotiated the federation sent three hundred and seventy two legal experts what do we have
thee and me

no response
try them again boost the signal strength
sheliak corporate this is the starship enterprise respond please

conversation is neither required nor desired
conversation is necessary if we are to find a solution to our mutual problem
our involvement in federation illegality is not indicated
both parties are involved sir
remove the humans from the tau cygna system three earth days remain
let us negotiate in good faith
negotiate to what purpose the treaty is signed
there is a thriving colony on that planet rather than uproot these people may i offer a compromise
denied
why
the law is paramount we are entitled
this is not a law it is a treaty it is designed to smooth relations between peoples not to act as a strait

jacket

you really think well have to leave tau cygna five
the possibility does exist yet gosheven seems unwilling to prepare for it why
maybe because youre an android i dont think gosheven likes the idea of machines ordering him around
i am not ordering him to do anything i am merely trying to persuade him that his people should prepare to evacuate do you believe my suggested course of action should be followed
of course
in spite of the fact that i am an android
because of that fact i dont have any silly prejudice against computers i like them not that any computer we have is half as sophisticated as you are

no i would say not
people can be selfish irrational stubborn malicious you name it but computers dont have those failings
and you conclude because of this that i am impartial hence you accept my recommendations yet gosheven does not
picard to commander data
data here
the sheliak wont bargain
understood sir

im contacting starfleet to arrange transport get those people prepared to evacuation we may have to move quickly

aye sir we must speak to gosheven immediately


gentlemen hows it coming what the hell is that
our first attempt
keep at it we need those transporters


you see this do you have any idea what it is or what it means
it is water a substance composed of two atoms of hydrogen
its not water its blood and its sweat its the result of a ninety years of combined effort this isnt a town its a monument to every man woman and child whos lived and died on tau cygna five
gosheven youre talking nonsense
am i my grandfather is buried on that mountain he died in a rock slide surveying the route for this aqueduct this colony exists because of his sacrifice and the sacrifice of thousands of others no were not leaving
the sheliak will not accept humans on their planet and they will not hesitate to use force to remove you
we will not be bullied off our land not by you and not by the sheliak

stubborn and irrational now what do we do
are his sentiments typical of the colonists
i hope not
if i can convince enough people of the necessity of leaving
dont you mean if we can convince

come
yes sir
three weeks starfleet is profuse in their apologies but it will still be three weeks until the arrival of a colony transport ship equipped with dedicated personnel shuttles
we cant wait three weeks
then the sheliak must agree to extend our deadline they plan to settle tau cygna five two days from now
one of their ships must already be en route
were going to intercept that ship
the sheliak may interpret that as a hostile act
a risk we have to take

the enterprise is going to try to intercept the sheliak colony ship your job well you know what your job is
commander

in human parlance i do not believe i can get the job done my training has prepared me for starship command duties as a cultural contact i am proving to be

less than exemplary
whats the situation
their leader refuses my counsel

he denies the logic of my arguments and speaks of structures they have built

then try something else
i have sir

in the last three hours and eight minutes i have spoken to fifty six colonists ten of those refused to believe a threat exists twenty two favour staying and fighting the sheliak sixteen prefer negotiation or

some form of passive resistance only eight were willing to consider evacuation and of those eight
data i cant help you i dont know these people i havent talked to them you have use that fancy

positronic brain of yours and carry out your mission
sir if i do not succeed how violent is the sheliak reaction likely to be

the treaty is the only thing that prevented them from eradicating the colony the moment they discovered it

ah
ah is right data

the lives of fifteen thousand people are riding on you

youd better get innovative riker out
data were having an effect so many people are asking questions about the sheliak that gosheven has called a public meeting
is there any indication that gosheven has changed his position
no but a meeting will give you the chance to present your recommendations
so far my attempts at persuasion have been ineffective

why did you do that
you appeared to need it
among humans a kiss usually serves to seal a friendship or indicate support attraction affection in this context i must assume that your intention was to express support
you dont really understand human behaviour do you
that is something of an understatement
sometimes i dont either androids are a lot more rational
thus far that quality has not helped me to accomplish my mission
a rational argument isnt always enough maybe to be more persuasive you need to use a little reverse psychology
elicit a desired behaviour by advocating its opposite that implies deception does it not
a little but if it helps us get our point across
perhaps this is a situation where excessive honesty can be detrimental


now are we progressing mister la forge
about like youd expect sir
splendid splendid carry on

he wants the impossible
thats the short definition of captain


youve all heard of the android starfleet sent here and youve been discussing why hes come ive called this meeting to replace misinformation with cold hard fact
i wish to speak
no leave now
do you consider your position so weak that it cannot withstand debate
let him talk
you know of the sheliak threat starfleet wishes to evacuate you for your own protection yet gosheven has decided otherwise that is his right and i will not waste time trying to reverse that decision i admire your conviction in the face of certain defeat though doomed your effort will be valiant and when you die you will die for land and honour your children will understand that they are dying for a worthy cause long after the battle is over their courage will be remembered and extolled
remembered by who
yes that is true there will be no one left alive to remember
 a valiant try android but what a low opinion you must have of us
i was simply attempting to describe your inevitable destruction in a manner that would have an emotional effect
and he describes it pretty damned well
are you ready to follow this machine give up without a fight he says were going to lose but i think thats just his cowardice talking
what if hes right and youre wrong shouldnt we consider that possibility
this colony exists because generations gave their lives for it many people died before we found a way to adapt to the radiation and many more died bringing water to the desert my grandfather
is buried on that mountain well wholl be left to bury you
have you considered what this evacuation means everything we have we abandon everything that we have built turns into dust everything that we have accomplished means nothing well i say no you elected me your leader follow me now i dont think our chances are as hopeless as he says and im willing to stake our lives on it any objections good because here we stand
aye we stand with you

then here you die

mister data i just want you to know that gosheven doesnt speak for all of us i see no reason to die needlessly
and you
im not sure goshevens done well for us but id like to hear more of what you have to say
there are many others that feel the same way but theyre very uneasy about confronting gosheven
get them together and well meet at my house

in our dealings with other nonhumanoid races there has been some point of reference not so with the sheliak
but we must have something in common we communicate
barely they have learned several federation languages but theirs continues to elude us
telepaths
attempted and failed actually the fact that any alien race communicates with another is quite remarkable we are stranded on a planet we have no language in common but i want to teach you mine  ssmarith what did i just say
cup glass
are you sure i may have meant liquid clear brown hot we conceptualise the universe in relatively the same way
point taken
in your talks you must be extremely accurate the treaty is five hundred thousand words the length was to accommodate the sheliak they consider our language irrational and demanded this level of complexity to avoid any future misunderstandings
captain we have the vessel carrying the sheliak colonists on visual
on my way so it begins

hailing frequencies
open
this is captain jeanluc picard of the starship enterprise
your purpose enterprise
we desire facetoface negotiation to settle the crisis on tau cygna five
meaningless
we are entitled to consultation under paragraph six hundred and fifty three subparagraph nine
granted

was that an invitation
i am taking it as such counsellor you have the bridge number one
helm maintain relative position mister worf tell transporter room two to stand by
aye sir

and once the federation resettles us well be left alone
if you so desire
we do we like to do things on our own
the federation will offer as little or as much help as you dictate
kentor are you with us
yes the question is how do we convince gosheven
why do we need to
because hes respected most people will do what he says
they respect you too if you take a stand theyll fall in line
i dont know goshevens got a lot of supporters
dont forget that kentor im disappointed i thought wed settled this
apparently that is not correct
still stirring up trouble
since when is talk trouble
its over dont you get it you had your say you lost
i appear to be reversing that defeat
no youre not youre just stubborn well let me tell you something

so am i
damn you gosheven
you killed him
ive killed no one i merely shut down a machine thats it everyone its time to go home youll see that im right


advance and speak
director we will comply with your request to remove the colony from tau cygna five but we need time
the given time has elapsed we carry the membership and we will proceed with their debarkation
the temporary presence of these humans should not interfere with your plans
unacceptable you must remove the creatures
im trying but the needed ship will not be available for three weeks
then you are in violation
i have admitted that i am only asking for a little flexibility
section five hundred and one paragraph seven hundred and sixteen subparagraph five unwanted lifeforms inhabiting h class worlds may be removed at the discretion of the sheliak corporate
we will remove them but you must grant us the time we require
you need time picard of the enterprise we will save you time we will eradicate the human infestation
they are not vermin they are citizens of the federation i will not permit this outrage
intelligent converse is impossible you do not discuss you gibber
between intelligent species of good will


i take it the sheliak just hung up on us again


i was afraid your neural pathways were scrambled beyond repair
i am equipped with diagnostic circuits and am able to correct many malfunctions
im not surprised at goshevens behaviour but kentor and the others they said they were with us i guess words dont mean very much
perhaps that is a part of our difficulty words are all we have been using humans seem to take much stronger notice of actions i require a phaser
whats a phaser
a type of weapon unfortunately it does not function in the presence of hyperonic radiation i will have to be innovative


hyperonic radiation randomises phaser beams but i believe i can improvise a servocircuit which will compensate by continuously recollimating the output
youre using your own neural subprocessors to build a smarter phaser
essentially correct get word to gosheven tell him i am coming to the pumping station tell him i am going to destroy the aqueduct
hell try to stop you
i sincerely hope so

go to yellow alert shields up
aye sir
mister riker put us nose to nose with the sheliak ship any move she makes match it
aye sir
mister worf hailing frequency
open they are not responding
they dont have to answer they just have to listen sheliak vessel you will have to get past me to get at the colony on tau cygna five
no response
close channel and get me that treaty theyve been beating us over the head with it for three days lets see if we cant find something in it that we can turn to our own advantage


stop that was the stun setting this is not

i can reduce this pumping station to a pile of debris but i trust my point is clear i am one android with a single weapon there are hundreds of sheliak on the way and their weapons are far more powerful they may not offer you a target they can obliterate you from orbit you will die never having seen the faces of your killers the choice is yours
there are other places other challenges

i really was willing to stay here and die for this
i know that this is just a thing and things can be replaced lives cannot


this is hopeless fighting would be preferable

thats it
i dont follow you sir
mister worf get me the sheliak
yes sir coming through sir
pursuant to paragraph one thousand two hundred and ninety i hereby formally request third party arbitration of our dispute
you have the right
furthermore pursuant to subsection d three i name the grisellas to arbitrate
grisellas
unfortunately they are currently in their hibernation cycle however they will awaken in six months at which time we can get this matter settled now do you want to wait or give me my three weeks
absurd we carry the membership we can brook no delay
then i declare the treaty in abeyance
wait negotiation is permiss

you enjoyed that
youre damned right
captain they are hailing us

sir

on screen
you may have your three weeks picard of the enterprise
thank you

captain we can do it we can modify the transporters
excellent
itll take fifteen years and a research team of a hundred
mister la forge i believe we will postpone
yes sir

lieutenant commander data to enterprise i am preparing to leave tau cygna five and await rendezvous instructions
acknowledged stand by
hi the evacuation plan is going well when the ship arrives well be ready to leave you succeeded
i could not have succeeded without your support and insight i am grateful for your assistance
good then you wont forget me
i am incapable of forgetting i will remember every detail of my visit here with perfect clarity
but nothing more
i do not understand
i guess what i really want to know is do you have any feelings for me
i have no feelings of any kind
no of course you dont

what was that for
you appeared to need it
so you saw i was unhappy and did what you concluded would make me feel better rational to the last

bye

come welcome home mister data well done
thank you sir
the good doctor was kind enough to provide me with a recording of your concert your performance shows feeling
as i have recently reminded others sir i have no feeling
its hard to believe your playing is quite beautiful
strictly speaking sir it is not my playing it is a precise imitation of the techniques of jascha heifetz and trenka bronken
is there nothing of data in what im hearing you see you chose the violinists heifetz and bronken have radically different styles different techniques yet you combined them successfully
i suppose i have learned to be creative sir when necessary
mister data i look forward to your next concert

evolution



riker to ensign crusher
go ahead

forget to set your alarm wesley
yes sir

im very sorry ill be right there this
captains log stardate  we have entered a spectacular binary star system in the kavis alpha sector on a most critical mission of astrophysical research our eminent guest doctor paul stubbs will attempt to study the decay of neutronium expelled at relativistic speeds by a massive stellar explosion which will occur here in a matter of hours


ensign our position
approaching one million kilometres from the neutron star sir
slow to one third impulse power
 spectacular isnt it my young friend
yes sir
over and over again the intense gravitational pull of the little neutron star sucks up the star material from the red giant and it builds up on the surface until it explodes every one hundred and ninety six years like clockwork and it is but eighteen hours away
eighteen hours seven minutes and ten seconds doctor
the interstellar counterpart to earths old faithful the only predictable burst of energy in the universe that can accomplish our goal

doctor stubbs if you would like to make one final inspection of the unit
captain ive been inspecting the egg for the last twenty years you may lay it when ready
begin launch sequence
shuttlebay two standby to launch the egg

standing by commander

five minutes to launch site

stabilise
the ship isnt responding sir
engineering

report mister la forge
checking for failure of inertial dampeners instruments say theyre working

captain were heading straight into the path of that stellar matter
shields up
negative the shields will not respond
thirty seconds to impact sir
manual override on shields
shields are rising
reset dampeners

mister la forge
dampeners not responding

unable to reset
reverse impulse engines

initiating reverse sequence now

our momentum is still carrying us into the path of the stellar matter
twelve seconds to impact sir
prepare for impact medical personnel report to the bridge commander data check all systems
all systems functioning normally sir
computer explain control malfunction
no control malfunction has been recorded


lay down carefully there you go
doctor stubbs the captain asked me to tell you that our systems are back to normal and we can try another launch attempt as soon as youre ready
quite a dynamic family team you crushers
well its nice to be together again i was at starfleet medical for a year i missed about two inches of him
im not sure id want my mother to be flying through space with me no i take that back i am sure i wouldnt want her my mother is a formidable woman too a woman of letters a great critic
i know
good lord son you didnt read that unauthorised biography is this all this boy does doctor fly the ship and read doesnt he ever have any fun
sure he does
actually most of my free time is taken up with my studies im trying to get into starfleet academy and i earn credits for the time spent on the enterprise but its just not the same
are you ready to sit up
well i am whole again thank you doctor come along wesley lets go see if humpty dumpty is still in one piece

computer fix the food slot
the food slot is functioning properly
well check again
the food slot is functioning properly
computer deactivate food slot

were analysing the engineering systems data captain so far were showing nothing unusual

in the computer log for that time period
run a level one diagnostic series come i want a computer thats one hundred percent to expedite doctor stubbs experiment as well as the food slots in sickbay picard out
which seem to be working again for the moment anyway
what can i do for you doctor
jeanluc how would you feel if you were a seventeen year old and the only starfleet officer whose mother was on board
inhibited i suppose but then im not wesley and if you are concerned about him i see no evidence that there is a problem
i know but in a funny kind of way thats exactly my point we talk we smile its almost too polite
beverly isnt it just a matter of time i know how difficult it was for you being away
tell me about him
well hes becoming a very fine officer he works as hard as any member of the crew riker says his studies are on line
no tell me about him
hes his fathers son honest trusting strong
does he have many friends has he ever been in love jeanluc im worried hes come so far so fast and since ive been back i dont feel
his dependence beverly look hes seventeen years old
what were you doing when you were seventeen
probably getting into more trouble than wesley i can assure you
so was i isnt that what seventeens supposed to be

no cracks in the armour well do just fine
how can you be so calm about this if i was about to make this kind of breakthrough
i have never doubted for a moment that this day would come wesley and i suspect that some day it will come for you as well i see a lot of me in you in my youth they called me a vunderkind do you understand vunderkind
its german isnt it
it means wonder child it is reserved for those of us who achieve early in life now the burden is yours
burden
to fulfill your potential you will never come up against a greater adversary than your own potential my young friend
red alert return to quarters immediately

still no visual contact thats impossible mister worf same magnification fifty degrees starboard
worf youre absolutely sure
sensors clearly indicate the approach of a borg vessel
shields up
shields are not responding
manual override is jammed its not going to work this time we dont have the shields captain
captain theyre firing energy weapons at us
evasive action
bring her round to two seven five mark three
predict current vector of borg ship
vector is gone and so is the borg vessel
youre telling me this is another computer glitch
it is conceivable that he was viewing a synthetically generated image sir
that our computer was daydreaming

computer identify malfunction immediately
pawn to bishop four knight to kings rook three bishop to queens bishop four knight to knight five queens knight to king two
controls are not responding sir
queen to bishop three bishop to bishop two
impulse engines are down
try warp engines
no sorry commander id better get back to engineering
mister la forge i want lieutenant worf to accompany you get me a full report on the prospects of getting our shields back number one mister data will you join me in the conference room as soon as possible its time to discuss the future of this mission if there still is one

the fact of the matter is we are dealing with a potential breakdown of the main computer
thats hard to accept
the system automatically provides for selfcorrection captain there has not been a systemswide technological failure on a starship in seventy nine years
excuse me captain but doctor stubbs is waiting outside

captain im sure you have everything under control id just like to know whats going on
of course doctor sit down counsellor commander la forge is attempting repairs even as we speak
attempting that doesnt sound particularly reassuring
doctor if at all possible we will continue this mission as planned
captain if we miss our chance now we dont get another for two centuries there will be many questions asked by starfleet if the enterprise fails in its duty
nevertheless my first and foremost consideration will be to ensure the safety of this ship and its crew
ensure the safety captain or are you really talking about playing it safe
my dear doctor in our current position when that star explodes youll get to watch your experiment from the inside out
i would rather die than leave
i dont believe you speak for the majority of the crew
doctor stubbs i know how much this means to you
my dear counsellor no insult intended but please turn off your beam into my soul i will share the feelings i wish to share well if we do not leave in time so be it its one sure way into the record books eh

his nonchalance is studied and practised
even my sensory perception picked that up
hes put his entire selfworth on the line with this experiment he is telling the truth when he says hed rather die than leave

call up the crosssection of computer core processor four five one i want to see elements zero two hundred through zero three hundred
aye sir
in order to get some power i had to bypass the computer core essentially hotwire the connection whoa whoa right there look at that lesion no wonder were coming apart at the seams its definitely some kind of continuing disintegration but from what i cant tell you and i havent the slightest idea how to stop it
its just a mechanical problem though right
increase magnification factor fifty i dont know wes but looking at it you know if i didnt know any better id say someone had climbed in there and started taking it apart




guinan i didnt think anyone would be here
ive never been any good at being confined to quarters as my husbands will attest to whats that
im just setting traps
i run a clean place
i know its not that its im scared guinan i think that everything thats been going wrong might be my fault
you want to tell me about it
ive been working on my final project for advanced genetics its on nanotechnology ive been studying the nanites we have in the sickbay genetic supplies theyre these little tiny robots with gigabytes of mechanical computer memory theyre designed to enter living cells and conduct repairs theyre supposed to remain confined to the lab
are you saying there are nanites loose
two of them thats all i just wanted to see how they would interact and function in tandem you see in my experiment i had proposed a theory that by working together they could combine their skills and increase their usefulness it was working
so you made better nanites
i was pulling an allnighter to collect my final data i fell asleep and when i woke up i saw the container had been left open its just a science project
you know a doctor friend once said the same thing to me frankenstein was his name
theyre really harmless i mean theyre equipped with only the most basic skills its almost impossible they could be responsible
almost
doctor crusher to wesley crusher
go ahead
i stopped by your quarters wes i assumed youd be there since youre off duty
i know i just i had some things to do
orders are orders mister crusher
on my way you wont tell anybody will you i know i will if its true
wes do you think youre going to get a good grade
i always get an a

so did doctor frankenstein
captains log supplemental our computer core has clearly been tampered with and yet there is no sign of a breach of security on board we have engines back and will attempt to complete our mission but without a reliable computer doctor stubbs experiment is in serious jeopardy

manual restart sequence
manual restart successful impulse engine functions all appear normal

aye sir

what in heavens name
it is stars and stripes forever sir by john phillip sousa a popular american composer of band music in the early twentieth century
yes yes i know that
computer shut off the music
the music is on all communications channels sir
weapons power communications were being stripped one system at a time
shut off the power to the bridge

commander la forge can you get us out of this star system safely
no
not now doctor
ill try captain i dont want to overload the engines
do it gently but do it
well circuit in auxiliary power to the bridge somehow well silence sousa if he decides to play an encore
the priority is to find out who or what is doing this number one the bridge such as it is is yours

the egg that stubbs laid
no one will say that
nobody will say anything at all wesley we will not even be mentioned i could live with failure well maybe not but never even to try to miss your one chance at bat do you know baseball
yes my father taught it to me when i was young
once centuries ago it was the beloved national pastime of the americas wesley abandoned by a society that prized fast food and faster games lost to impatience but i have seen the great players make the great plays
do you recreate them on a holodeck
no in here  with the knowledge of statistics runs hits and errors times at bat box scores men like us do not need holodecks wesley i have played seasons in my mind it was my reward to myself for patience knowing my turn would come call your shot point to a star one great blast and the crowd rises a brand new era in astrophysics postponed one hundred and ninety six years on account of rain


we have to talk you really look like you could use some rest wesley
i know its okay really
no its not okay really
look mom im just checking some traps that i set to see if i can find out whats happening to the enterprise
on someones orders
were running out of time for doctor stubbs
you cant put everything on your shoulders wesley even when youre off duty youre on duty
mom you dont understand
you are a seventeen year old boy
im also an acting officer and i have responsibilities
im beginning to think maybe youve taken on too many responsibilities
look i have done everything that everyone has asked of me and more and how can you know you havent even been here
im here now wesley come on ill help you what are you looking for wesley
i think ive made a horrible mistake


nanites tiny machines built from the atom up designed to have exposure only to the inside of nucleii during cellular surgeries until then they are kept tightly confined in a nonfunctioning state
these are not ordinary nanites
no they have evolved
evolved how does a machine evolve
its true i am responsible for this i allowed two of the nanites to interact for a school project i wanted to increase their capabilities and they escaped
school project just how far have these things evolved
well this is a sample of linear memory crystal from our computer core

its like candy to them
as you can see theyre able to mechanically replicate themselves
it is conceivable that with each new generation they enhance their own design the rate of evolution would be extraordinary
how many generations are we dealing with here
engineering display computer core processor four five one element zero two nine nine
increase magnification factor one thousand
can it be possible they know what theyre doing
why would they attack us
why does a mosquito bite your ear and who cares the answer is simple call an exterminator
doctor stubbs these nanites are now working with a new collective intelligence operating together teaching each other skills
oh really im sorry but this is nonsense you cant have a civilisation of computer chips theyre made in a plant in dakar senegal ive watched the construction
then how do you explain what weve seen here
its no more mysterious than watching a strain of the leutscher virus reproduce itself and that at least is a bona fide lifeform how many disease germs and viruses have you destroyed in your time doctor crusher
doctor stubbs we cannot exterminate something that may or may not be intelligent
my good captain
theres still time ensign will you work with mister data to try to remove them safely if things get worse well use stronger measures

gentlemen i need a computer that is one hundred percent in less than eight hours and we still have core reconstruction to consider
were trying low gamma bursts we think it might slow down their productivity
have you considered a high level charge
high level gamma radiation would kill them doctor
i know


i cant get the story of gulliver out of my head overpowered by lilliputians how long do we have to wait
we can continue to bypass the part of the computer thats affected but if the nanites are spreading through the whole the ship
do you smell a change what 


picard to la forge we have an environmental system malfunction on the bridge acknowledge
aye sir
nitrogen oxide toxic levels
working on it captain

ive switched to manual control of the air handling system

mister worf report
he entered a computer access room and sterilised one of the processors with gamma radiation
the nanites in the upper core are all dead captain
you have no choice now it is a matter of survival
doctor stubbs if you were a member of my crew sir i would
but i am not a member of your crew sir i am a representative of the highest command of the federation which has directed you to perform my experiment
if any man woman or child on this ship is harmed as a result of your experiment i will have your head before the highest command in the federation
good lord you are talking about machines with a screw loose simply turn them off and be done with them
doctor stubbs your own actions have provided evidence to the contrary when you destroyed the nanites in the core they responded by interfering with our life support systems it is difficult to accept these as random actions by machines with loose screws in effect you may have proven that the nanites do have a collective intelligence
captain the ship is at risk extermination may be our only alternative
a good point
lieutenant worf i want doctor stubbs confined to his quarters until further notice

mister data can you find me some way to communicate with these things
with intelligence there is the capability of language but it will depend on how far their evolution has brought them we could modify the circuitry in the universal translator to make it capable of communications with them
proceed

may i come in
you just cant resist can you counsellor
i only want to help
yes yes to break the shell to get in touch with my true feelings
im only worried about your state of mind doctor
all right counsellor what is it that has you so worried
your singlemindedness your need to have this experiment work
but it will picard has no choice now he must defend the enterprise counsellor when this is all over i will show you new manhattan on beth delta one as youve never seen it and we will laugh over glasses of champagne
your self portrait is so practiced so polished
yes isnt it though
it is stretched so tight the tension fills this room and if you finally fail i fear it will snap
a good try counsellor but sometimes when you reach beneath a mans self portrait as you so eloquently put it deep down inside what you find is nothing at all

lockman on first dark on second thompson at the plate branca on the mound


hes coming around
i cannot believe this was not an arbitrary attack
has data made any progress in contacting them
picard you must protect me kill them


commander riker on my signal we will gammairradiate all computer systems throughout the enterprise lets put an end to this conflict
worf prepare to activate gamma pulse generators
electromagnetic scanners ready captain

captain i have established contact

as we continue captain they are virtually learning the concept of communication each new generation is making modifications
can we actually talk to them yet
i believe it is worth an attempt sir
commander riker bring doctor stubbs to the bridge

i dont think this is a wise idea they have already tried to kill me once
one sure way into the record books doctor

i am ready sir
tell them the human who destroyed their comrades is here and wishes to address them
captain if i
you sir you will explain your error and apologise and pray that we can negotiate a peace we can all live with is that clear
captain if a face to face negotiation would be helpful i would like to volunteer myself as a conduit
yourself data
i can easily furnish the nanites with a schematic design of my neurological structure entering my neural network would require no more than their most basic skills
thats what they were designed for
they could penetrate the molecular fabric of my handcovering into my nerve circuitry and interface with my verbal programs
if they have control of a starfleet commander they become an even greater threat
how can we be sure we can get them out of you
it would be a considerable risk sir but it would also represent a gesture of trust on our part it could be an important step toward peace sir
all right data propose it to the nanites
the answer is yes

they are ready captain
proceed

you are very strange looking creatures
in our travels we have encountered many other creatures perhaps even strangerlooking than ourselves but we try to coexist peacefully with them
why did you attack us
we misinterpreted your actions as an attack on us
we were seeking raw materials for our replicating process
yes but you endangered this vessel in which we all travel you nearly killed a crewmember
we meant no harm we were exploring
i understand we are also explorers we mean no harm to any other living creature
i am the one responsible for the deaths in the computer core
we know who you are
i deeply regret the incident i am a scientist on an important mission your colleagues exploration of the core memory put our mission at risk i was only trying to protect a lifetime of work from being destroyed i am at your mercy
what is at your mercy
he asks your forgiveness this conflict was started by mistakes on both sides lets agree to end it here and now
we agree
i pledge we will do everything possible to assist your continued survival
thank you but we have evolved beyond any need for your assistance this vessel has become too confining we require relocation
captains log supplemental doctor stubbs has used his influence to have planet kavis alpha four designated the new home of the nanite civilisation commander datas neural network has been vacated he has been returned to us unharmed and with the help of the nanites our computer core has been reconstructed in time for the experiment


ten seconds to stellar blast sir
were at forty million kilometres from the neutron star sir
hold your position

doctor


do you have any children guinan
a lot
ever have any trouble relating to them
just one
one
wouldnt listen to anybody
well they all go through that
not in a species of listeners
did he grow out of it
it took several hundred years but i managed to bring him around
how
a mother shapes her child in ways she doesnt even realise sometimes just by listening

cute couple
see now that is healthy for a boy his age i mean that as a doctor not as just a mother it is so good to see him having fun for a change with an attractive young woman who obviously looks at him with extraordinary affection what do you know about this girl
the survivors

captains log stardate  we are cautiously entering the delta rana star system three days after receiving a distress call from the federation colony on its fourth planet the garbled transmission reported the colony under attack from an unidentified spacecraft our mission is one of rescue and if necessary confrontation with a hostile force

shields up maximum strength
shields up sensors do not indicate the presence of any armed space vehicles operating in the rana system
they could be cloaked or otherwise shielded mister crusher bring us in well clear of the planets three moons
aye sir
captain we are not receiving rana fours call sign
open a frequency to colony operations
no response rana four is emissions quiet
captain there are eleven thousand inhabitants in this colony at this range i should be sensing something im not
mister data put the planet on the main viewer magnify

my god
helm put us in high equatorial orbit scan for survivors
survivors down there
sensors are scanning ninety degrees of longitude as we orbit i am detecting no bodies of water no vegetation no artificial structures
life form readings are negative
could the colonists have escaped
that is highly unlikely rana four possessed no interstellar spacecraft
who would cause devastation on that order
hold it captain ive got something here thirty seven degrees north and sixty two degrees east its a structure
life
two life forms possibly human
put that area on the main viewer magnify

the structure is located at the centre of the vegetation
an entire planet obliterated except for a few acres of trees and grass and one building
it must be some kind of illusion
negative it is as you see it
number one i think you had better see whos at home

if theyre the only survivors of a nuclear holocaust they cant be in very good shape
i understand counsellor
what i sense of them is human
and something else
its difficult to explain i feel theres something different about these two people im sorry i cant be clearer than that
were ready

good luck number one

energise


geordi what can you tell me
the house is a typical settlement structure with adaptations its thermal properties all seem to conform to known materials
if there are indicators as to why this particular area has remained intact i cannot detect them
worf the interior of the house
there is one individual is located at the south end of the house the other toward the north there is a weapon a lowyield phaser nonfunctional in proximity to the frontroom individual
i guess a frontal assault is unwarranted stay here i think ill try an oldfashioned knock on the door
commander wait theres something concealed under the surface

what are you doing there this is private property who are you people
im commander william riker of the uss enterprise crewmembers may i comet down and approach you
you leave him right where he is
should i incapacitate him commander
no were a rescue party we picked up your colonys distress call and we came as fast as we could

kevin kevin what are you doing cant you see theyre here to help us cant you see theyre human
go back in the house rishon this could be some kind of a trick
wed almost given up hope we were afraid maybe the whole federation had been attacked

what about the colony do you know of any other survivors
its been days since weve seen or heard from anybody no dont dont tell me that were the only ones
they came in a spaceship so big you could see it in orbit they took our world apart piece by piece
who
we dont know we never saw their faces
you dont know where they came from where they are now
i guess theyve gone away
oh im sorry im only performing a physical could i have your names please just for the record
im rishon uxbridge and this is my husband kevin
botanists originally from the aquatic city new martim vaz in earths atlantic ocean residents of the rana four colony for five years you maam are eighty two years of age and a composer of tao classical music you sir are eighty five years of age and a specialist in symbiotic plant life you have been married for fifty three years i memorised the colony register on the way to rana four in the event that such information would be needed
is something wrong
with your permission id like to look inside of the house
why what could interest you in there
mister uxbridge as far as weve been able to determine you and your wife and this house are all that survived that attack thats was either a bizarre coincidence or by design and i dont favour the coincidence theory
are you saying that we were kept alive intentionally
yes
i dont understand you dont think rishon and i did something that merited survival do you i mean betrayed the others
im not accusing you of anything mister uxbridge the attacking force spared you for some reason wed like to know why now may i go inside

ill make everyone a nice cup of tea we have lovely tea here on rana it grows wild nearly every 
sir may i say your attempt to hold the away team at bay with a nonfunctioning weapon was an act of unmitigated gall
didnt fool you huh
i admire gall

go ahead pick it up its a music box its been in my family for generations

theres nothing unusual about this house except the fact that its here what about them
theyre in reasonably good health both show signs of stress which is understandable considering what theyve been through
somehow theyre different lets get back to the ship well take them with us excuse mrs uxbridge wed better return to our ship now
but i havent finished fixing your tea commander
im sorry but were finished here now i can allow time for you and kevin to pack
what do you mean pack
youre not thinking of taking us with you are you
surely you dont want to remain here how can you take care of yourselves
kevin i cant leave my home dont let them do this to us
no ones going to make us leave
youll be protected on our ship you could still be in danger here on rana
commander we appreciate your concern but were not going anywhere well manage we always have
all right i cant make you come with us  are you familiar with one of these well be in the system for the next several days at least if you reconsider please contact us
well be fine commander we have each other

are they collaborators did they provide the colonys assailants with something that abetted the total destruction of rana four in order to protect their own lives
what could two botanists in their eighties possess that could possibly aid whoever attacked the planet
we dont know what the enemy needed doctor love fear hope

maybe theyre being held hostage in some fashion
nothing in the tricorder readings indicated they were under that kind of stress
counsellor counsellor troi
im sorry i dont sense them well enough

number one you say the couple is incapable of sustaining themselves
theres a fusion reactor in the house good for another five years of power but their water table is tainted they have nothing to feed themselves except for a small garden
they wont come to the ship
they were adamant
well do all that we can to help them but in the meantime i want them kept under surveillance
im sorry im not feeling very well id like to go to my quarters
by all means
is there anything i can do

captain a search of the ranian system has determined that the hostile force that attacked this planet is no longer present
i remember a starfleet admiral once saying the same thing about some renegade andorians in the triangulum system it turns out that they had dismantled their ship and hidden it
those andorians did not have to contend with someone of my thoroughness i will stake my reputation

dont listen think of something else stop please stop

yes

i was concerned i came to see if i could be of any help
im fine theres nothing wrong im just tired thats all
now i may not have your gifts at reading emotions counsellor but i can tell when someone is in pain and hiding it
its so silly i hear music in my mind music that wont stop
perhaps its a symptom of fatigue weve all been inflicted one time or another with that melody that wont go away
no its deeper than that the song doesnt stops for an instant it plays in perfect clarity from beginning to end over and over again i dont even know what song it is i never heard it before
when did this start
a few hours ago while the away team was on the surface i was trying to i was thinking of rishon and kevin
rishon and kevin and
i cant explain it captain theyre elusive theyre im sorry
well try and rest take the necessary sleep inducements if you have to


data give us a visual magnification factor fifty

look at the size of that

now where did that come from
apparently it was riding a lagrange point hiding behind rana fours furthest moon
our vehicle classification index can put no identity to it its design is completely foreign
but thats our boy approximately five times our mass and carrying enough armament to pulverize a planet
lieutenant
i er cannot explain this captain
its heading for the planet
hailing frequencies
open
mister data ask them to identify themselves and match our orbit
they have received the message captain but are ignoring it
maximum shields ready all weapon systems
aye sir
its assuming an attack posture dont be surprised if

the vessel is firing jacketed streams of positrons and antiprotons equivalent firepower forty megawatts shields are holding  again forty megawatts no damage
if thats the best they can do this should last about five minutes
mister worf lets raise our voice a little fire phasers just a warning shot mister data invite them to stand to

the vessel has assumed a position outside of the rana system and it is rapidly increasing velocity
helm initiate pursuit
aye sir the vessel has reached warp two and continues on a steady acceleration curve were not getting any closer commander
give us a superior curve mister crusher
warp three warp four the warship continues to match our curve simultaneously point for point warp four point five warp five warp five point five
riker to la forge give us everything you can to close the gap geordi
yes sir

ill get you to nine point three seven in fifteen seconds

warp eight point five warp nine the warship continues to match our acceleration curve perfectly
number one i have the distinct impression that were being toyed with take us back to rana four
back
we have unfinished business there i need to have a talk with those two people you have the bridge
reduce speed bring us around on a return course this ones getting away


good afternoon im sorry if i startled you im jeanluc picard captain of the enterprise i have brought you something you will need if youre going to stay on rana four its a matter replicator it has limited capabilities but
thank you but we have no use for such a thing
it will provide you with clothing food and clean water lieutenant worf demonstrate its operation
we dont need it
kevin you know we do thank you captain kevin and i were about to have afternoon tea you and mister worf must join us
id like that very much
rishon they only want to spy on us like this morning
kevin uxbridge i have never turned anyone away from this house and im not going to start now captain
thank you

stop stop please ill do anything make it stop

please im here to help
its so loud its getting louder please i cant stand it make it stop
move her to the bed

this will help you relax
i hear it its still there its so loud
take her to sickbay
no i want to stay in my quarters
i can get you to sleep
i dont want to sleep the music will only follow me
i can induce delta sleep lock out even your deepest dreams
its not a dream its real

kevin and i first saw each other on a ship at sea he was a starving student with this threadbare suit and mismatched shoes i was travelling with my parents who did not like the way that he kept hanging around two hours after i met him i asked him to marry me and he knew i was serious i dont think that he has ever recovered from that day

well what do you think mister worf
good tea nice house
why did you leave the earth and come to a brand new planet when you did
you mean at our age well we thought it might make us fall in love all over again it worked
must have been terrible when the colony was fighting for its life
yes it was fires lit the sky there was thunder this unbelievable thunder the ground never stopped shaking
and yet you survived
we dont know why we survived and the others didnt ive tried to put some purpose to it but i cant
i was wondering captain when you and your ship would be leaving
i dont have an answer for that a few hours ago we encountered a warship possibly the one which attacked you we forced it to leave the system but we were unable to affect it otherwise it could return
kevin you said it had gone away
i guess i was wrong dont worry it didnt hurt us before it wont hurt us now
do you know that for a fact kevin
no but i dont enjoy seeing my wife frightened weve told you time and time again we dont know why we were spared
but there had to be some reason in some way you were different from the other colonists your geographical location your philosophical beliefs the colour of your eyes in some way you were set apart from them
there was a difference im a man of special conscience while the others were doing what they could i chose not to fight
well that is your protected right
but i can assure you the attacking ship had no way of realising this i expected to die like all the others theres no reason for you and your ship to remain captain we can manage without you

kevin grieved for the others captain but he did nothing he is a very gentle man you must understand that
what about you rishon is that how you feel
i wanted to fight but i stayed with my husband well captain thank you again for the replicator id better clean up now
before we leave i ask you one more time to come to the ship for your own safety
captain i am frightened but i cant leave rana even if it means my life

i dont understand it ive inhibited almost all the activity of the neocortex and she continues to behave as if shes hearing the music were going to have to shield her from all outside stimuli by inducing coma


i have a positive identification commander it is the vessel that attacked us earlier it is reentering the system at high velocity and is approaching rana four
give us a tight visual data is it my imagination or does it look a lot meaner this time shields up weapons ready

our friend is back
im not surprised mister worf open a hailing frequency warn the vessel to stay clear of the planet
aye sir but they are already within firing range

shields are down captain they hit us with four hundred gigawatts of particle energy
damage
superficial but im having trouble reassembling the shields  shields down there is thermal damage to the hull
the warship is capable of striking us with far more powerful bursts
theyre manoeuvring to come between the enterprise and rana four
number one we have been exemplary in our patience
lieutenant worf fire phasers on full with a simultaneous spread of torpedoes

the vessel appears undamaged sir its defences are apparently able to absorb incoming matter and energy
commence rapid fire with all weapons on full

shields down internal damage weapon systems control has been lost
riker to sickbay medical assistance to the bridge
on our way commander
mister crusher move the enterprise out of range of the attacking vessel
aye sir
mister worf
the vessel has terminated its pursuit it is assuming an orbit around rana four
kevin and rishon
we cant help them but its my guess theyre in no danger

number of casualties
sixtysix
fatalities
none weve been able to treat everyone

can you help her
ive done everything i can i dont understand the nature of this music she says shes hearing or where its coming from
could it be telepathic
yes but im not the expert at determining that
theyre blocking her sensitivity theyre stopping her from seeing the truth
whos stopping her
kevin and rishon
what
they wanted us to leave rana and thats exactly what were doing picard to bridge
yes captain
number one i want you to maintain this course for another hour

and then turn the enterprise around and take it back to rana four
we still wont have our shields restored by then

take it back number one and this time nothing is going to lure us away

sir sensors indicate no spacecraft in the vicinity of rana four but captain
forget your previous error mister worf there is no way you could have prevented it
captain the uxbridge house is coming into transporter range
mister worf will you accompany me to the transporter room you have the bridge number one
captain i think you should reconsider the warship has come after us twice it could come back
i disagree number one i dont think it knows were here i think it believes that it has run us off for good however that will all change once im back on board
sir
its protecting kevin and rishon it responds to their wishes indirectly or directly im not sure but thats what im going to put to the test


celebrating
what are you doing here what do you want
this is the second time that you have shown surprise at my appearance kevin the first time was understandable but now unless it is because you never expected to see me again
why do you keep interfering with our lives captain
it is not my intention to interfere only to help you and rishon
then please leave us alone
i promise you that when i leave this house i will never set foot in it again but the enterprise will remain in orbit over the planet
why
to protect you
thats not necessary i thought you understood
it is necessary youre in great danger a warship has returned
kevin
hes lying rishon
we have fought a pitched battle with it and lost many of my crew have been injured including a woman whos mind is slowly being destroyed by telepathic manipulation
no please no
this is a form of intimidation i have my rights
your rights what about rishon is she in favour of being here left here come to the enterprise let me take you where youll be safe
no i cant leave kevin
im staying shes safe here with me in this house
why are you safe why is this house a sanctuary does it have to do with you with your refusal to fight tell me this if rishon were in danger would you kill to save her life
no not for her not for anyone i will not kill
please stop hurting him captain leave our house
it is my sworn duty to protect you the enterprise will remain in orbit around rana four as long as the two of you are alive

number one an update please
little change captain our shields are still inoperable we have partial control of our weapons and ive doubled the repair crews
the warship is approaching from high orbit it is very close three hundred thousand kilometres distant
how is that possible is something wrong with the sensors
thats no concern number one its here and its precisely on schedule
the vessel has altered its course to a direct intercept with the enterprise
worf arm phasers and photon torpedoes prepare to fire
belay those orders mister worf
the vessel is now within twenty thousand kilometres of the enterprise and closing
let it come let it come activate the main viewer
evasive action sir
the enterprise will hold its position mister worf
weapons sir
on my orders not before
the vessel is entering a low orbit around rana four it appears it is preparing to fire at the planet captain
understood
my calculations indicate that its target is the house of kevin and rishon uxbridge
there will be no interference from us mister data
the house has been obliterated
scan for survivors
there are no survivors
mister worf prepare a photon torpedo fire at the enemy vessel when ready
aye sir

number one what reason does the enterprise have for remaining at rana
the unknown vessel has been destroyed the uxbridges have been destroyed theres no reason for the enterprise to remain
good helm move us into a higher orbit so that we may keep the surface of the planet under surveillance
aye sir but captain what are we watching for
anything everything ill be in my ready room if im needed that will be all for now

come
captain may i speak with you
its my pleasure number one
weve been observing the planet very carefully for three hours weve seen nothing i have the feeling youre waiting for something to happen
your captain is acting on an assumption will and im not sure what the result will be or even that my assumption is correct we found two people alive in a house on a devastated planet but there was only one survivor of the war on rana four

why is it we maintain watch on a planet that is now totally dead
bridge to captain picard you had better come see this

captain commander the house is back trees grass everything happened right in front of us
mister worf do you see any survivors
i detect two life forms inside the house it appears kevin and rishon were not destroyed
helm take us within transporter range were going to beam them aboard directly onto the bridge
but captain will they not protest
let them

my apologies if i interrupted a waltz
why have you brought us here against our will
i want to end the suffering of one of my crewmembers
i dont understand
kevin does hes the cause at first i couldnt understand why your house survived the holocaust when the others hadnt then it occurred to me it had been destroyed that dwelling where you served me tea where you danced your waltzes is a reproduction real to the touch but capable of being created destroyed and created all on a whim
youre joking with us captain cant you see this is hurting my husband
rishon hear what he has to say
more than anything else you wanted the enterprise away from rana because the house the plot of land your very existence were incongruities that you were not prepared to explain the warship another recreation tried to chase us away twice and failed but when i came to your house the second time i provided you with the only condition that would make the enterprise leave your deaths you did your best to satisfy that condition
im deeply sorry about the woman i will help her but i must know what you intend to do with me afterwards
youll be taken to the nearest starbase and held responsible for the attack on the enterprise and possibly the deaths of eleven thousand people
no he never killed anyone
the destruction of the planet happened just as i told you
but you havent told us the whole story how it ended the part about rishon
what is he saying
rishon i can touch you i can hear your voice i can smell your perfume in every respect you are a real person with your own mind and beliefs but you do not exist you died along with the others defending the colony he recreated you just as he recreated the house

you are the only living thing that really exists on rana and though you look human youre not

hes in the turbolift
let him go
captain he is dangerous
so dangerous mister worf that he could have destroyed us in an instant had he wished track him alert the crew to keep clear of hm i want him to understand we mean him no harm
will he return to the planet
if he is the creature of conscience i believe him to be he has someone to help first


ive taken the music from her mind shes alright now shes sleeping she was beginning to sense who i really was ive been living as a human for over fifty years but i couldnt hide from her she has suffered because of my pride and selfishness it will not happen again

what happened on rana four the truth this time all of it
very well for what its worth i am a douwd an immortal being of disguises and false surroundings i have lived in this galaxy for many thousands of years although until today no one has known my true identity once while traveling in human form i chanced to fall in love with an earth woman i put aside my powers and became her husband our life was happy and rich eventually we came to this planet to live our final years now she is dead she never knew what i really was
your colony was attacked by a warship
belonging to the husnock a species of hideous intelligence who knew only aggression and destruction i could have destroyed them with a mere thought but i did not do so
you had the power to stop them but you didnt
i refused to for the same reason i refused to stop the enterprise i will not kill
so you let the colonists fight a hopeless battle
i tried to fool the husnock as i tried to fool you it only made them angrier more cruel
and then what you most feared happened rishon went to fight with the colonists and died with them
how i wish i could have died with her
but you couldnt you were left alone
yes i saw her broken body i went insane my hatred exploded and in an instant of grief i destroyed the husnock
why did you try to hide this from all of us was it out of guilt for not helping rishon and the others when they were alive
no no no no you dont understand the scope of my crime i didnt kill just one husnock or a hundred or a thousand i killed them all all husnock everywhere are eleven thousand people worth fifty billion is the love of a woman worth the destruction of an entire species this is the sin i tried so hard to keep you from learning now why i wanted to chase you from rana
were not qualified to be your judges we have no law to fit your crime youre free to return to the planet and to make rishon live again


helm break orbit full impulse
captains log stardate  we are departing the rana system for starbase one three three we leave behind a being of extraordinary power and conscience i am not certain if he should be praised or condemned only that he should be left alone
who watches the watchers

captains log stardate  we are en route to mintaka three where a three man federation anthropological field team has been studying the inhabitants our mission is to resupply the outpost and repair their malfunctioning reactor

mister la forge report
weve finished replicating the parts theyll need but what i dont understand is why a three man station would need a reactor capable of producing four point two gigawatts
enough to power a small phaser bank a subspace relay station or
a hologram generator oh a duck blind right theyre anthropologists
who are studying an extended family of mintakans at close range from a camouflaged observation post
according to doctor barrons preliminary reports the mintakans are protovulcan humanoids at the bronze age level quite peaceful and highly rational
which is not surprising considering how closely their evolution parallels vulcan
captain incoming transmission from mintaka three
thank you lieutenant on screen

barron to enterprise our temporary repairs have failed the reactor is now inoperative
do you have battery backup
three hours at best
captain if we increase to warp seven we can be there in twenty three minutes
make it so were on our way

weve lost contact sir
increase to warp nine


the frameworks still charged so watch it


 why did we have to come so early
 when the sun reaches its zenith i have to be ready to take the measurements
youll be ready youve read the sundial hundreds of times
yes father but never as the appointed record keeper

youre taking your duties quite seriously your mother would have been proud of you
what is that up there father what is it

i dont know

keep work palmer
its all right its all right
the hologram generator is now functioning sir
all we need now is power
almost there


you wait here oji


enterprise beam martinez and his patient directly to sickbay
commander


doctor be careful
ive got to get down there

crusher to enterprise medical emergency two to beam directly to sickbay
aye doctor


that should do it


 you increased the levels of tricordrazine  let me see his chart please

doctor crusher
before you start quoting me the prime directive hed already seen us the damage was done it was either bring him aboard or let him die
then why didnt you let him die
because we were responsible for his injuries
im not sure that i concur with that reasoning doctor but now that hes here you must remove all memory of his encounter with the away team
by erasing short term recall
it has been accomplished before
i am familiar with doctor pulaskis technique i cant guarantee it will be effective on mintakan brain chemistry their liezone levels are much lower
wait no no we must evacuate
doctor barron youre on the enterprise youre safe
the others
doctor warren is here were doing all we can

and palmer where is palmer
still on mintaka three
picard you have to find him
we will
he may be hurt
rest assured we shall not leave until he is located
thank you picard
picard to bridge report
scans of the planet detect no humans captain
very well put us into a close orbit
sir a close orbit will increase sensor efficiency by only four percent
i want that four percent lieutenant
aye sir
picard out
picard
damn
well doctor your next task is clear


oji oji

father
here oji
father i thought id never see you again when you and the woman vanished i was sure you were dead
i think i was but i was brought back to life oji i awoke in an incredible place and my wounds were gone i had been healed
how is that possible
long ago our people believed in beings with great powers these beings made the rains come told the sun when to rise they caused all life to be born to grow to die
but those are just tales father old superstitions
but perhaps the beliefs of our ancestors are true nothing else can explain whats happened everything is changed now oji we must tell the others

barron is stable but warren is still critical
palmer is missing a scan of the planet shows mintakan life forms only no humans however
the area around the duck blind exhibits karst topography sinkholes underground rivers and caverns and the rock strata contain a high concentration of thallium compounds which may be obstructing our sensor beams
so if palmer in his delirium fled into a cave we may be unable to detect his life signs
correct sir
captain if he is still alive he needs medical attention we must send an away team to locate him
but our presence must not interfere with the cultural development of the mintakans
agreed further contamination must be prevented
i have a suggestion
first officers log stardate  counsellor troi and i are beaming down to mintaka three to locate doctor palmer and to determine the extent of the cultural contamination doctor crusher has temporarily altered our features and skin colour shes also implanted subcutaneous communicators so that any transmissions we receive will be inaudible to the mintakans

riker to enterprise do you hear me
perfectly commander i will be monitoring you continuously
mintakan emotions are quite interesting like the vulcans they have highly ordered minds a very sensible people for example mintakan women precede their mates its a signal to other women
this mans taken get your own
not precisely more like if you want his services im the one you have to negotiate with
what kind of services
all kinds
they are a sensible race


i understand your skepticism had it not happened to me i would find it difficult to accept as well
but it did happen just as weve said
fento you know the legends better than anyone do they not speak of beings like the kind ive seen
who could vanish like smoke
there are the stories of the overseer who could appear and disappear at will
and couldnt this overseer heal the dead
he had supreme power or so our ancestors believed
i believe i have seen the overseer he is called the picard
uh oh
his memorys intact
the procedure didnt work
 liko all this talk of supernatural beings no one has believed that for countless generations just as we no longer believe the stars control our fates or the spirits of the dead haunt the living
nuria im not saying all the old beliefs are true but i did see the picard and i was restored back to life
we are visitors weve come to trade our cloth may we speak
please do we welcome outsiders i am nuria
i am troi and this is riker youve had a very interesting dream
dream it was real
my father and i both witnessed these beings
if you are father and daughter you may well have shared the same dream
that is not reasonable
is that any less reasonable than being magically transformed to another place by the picard
nuria

it has to be palmer the one the picard wished to find
remarkable you were speaking the truth
the picard will be pleased

riker to picard
go ahead number one
we have a problem

with the contamination
its worse than we suspected

the mintakans are beginning to believe in a god

and the one theyve chosen is you
picard you must beam palmer aboard immediately without medical attention
its not as simple as that he is surrounded by mintakans if he dematerialises before their eyes the impact
it will slightly increase the cultural contamination which already exists a small price for saving palmers life
number one

is there any chance of your freeing palmer and transporting up unseen
we can try
try hard

picard out
picard i must protest youre endangering palmer with this delay
i am aware of that but each of us including doctor palmer took an oath that we would uphold the prime directive if necessary with our lives


riga and i were hunting on the third ridge we followed a hornbuck into a cave the stranger was there asleep
this palmer is one of the overseers servants
yes the picard has many servants isnt that true fento
according to legend but if this palmer is a servant of the overseer what was he doing in the cave
perhaps he ran away
or he failed the picard somehow and was hiding from him
we should bind him in case he wakes and tries to escape
its senseless for this stranger to be held captive all this talk of the overseer its old superstitions
i disagree all the evidence indicates that the overseer exists
and i heard the picard say he wanted to find palmer
then by keeping palmer safe we will please the picard
and hell grant us favours in return
favours
it is said that the overseer is all powerful he can provide gentle winters plentiful hunting fertile crops anything
he could even bring back those who have died
its agreed we will save palmer for the picard
ive seen another one like palmer
another servant of the picard
hes headed toward the caves
fento stay and bind palmer


where
over there

that knot wont hold if i may
please do
you need a knot thatll tighten under pressure let me show you

father the suns reaching its zenith if i dont go to measure
go


forgive me friend but the stranger must be set free

riker
riker to enterprise lock on and prepare to beam us directly to sickbay but hang on for my signal
acknowledged commander
riker stop


oji
its riker hes taking palmer
hali yuri dont let her escape

im clear energise

data has counsellor troi beamed up
negative commander sensors show shes in the midst of a group of mintakans
damn


he is all right hali find riker and palmer
why did you and riker take palmer from us
we did not take palmer

we set him free riker and i do not believe in these fables about an overseer
dont you realise what youve done youve angered the picard and we may all suffer for it i know ive seen him he is allpowerful

fanto werent there stories about the overseer destroying those who offended him
stories nothing more
liko well get palmer back riker was carrying him they cant have gone far
still the picard may blame us for letting palmer escape perhaps we should punish her let the overseer know

that she and riker acted alone

we will keep troi captive
thats not enough
you would have us harm her
if it will hold off the picards anger yes ive seen how powerful he is
i am unwilling to hurt her needlessly we will wait for hali to return
and if they dont find palmer
then we may have to do as liko suggests

doctor you believe the mintakans are capable of harming counsellor troi
they are not normally a violent people but these are extraordinary circumstances theyre trying to comprehend what they believe to be a god
recommendations
the mintakans wish to please the overseer but they can only guess what he wants they need a sign
are you suggesting
you must go down to mintaka three
masquerading as a god
absolutely out of the question the prime directive
has already been violated the damage is done all we can do now is minimise it
by sanctioning their false beliefs
by giving them guidelines letting them know what the overseer expects of them
doctor barron i cannot i will not impose a set of commandments on these people to do so violates the very essence of the prime directive
like it or not we have rekindled the mintakans belief in the overseer
and are you saying that this belief will eventually become a religion
its inevitable and without guidance that religion could degenerate into inquisitions holy wars chaos
horrifying doctor barron your report describes how rational these people are millennia ago they abandoned their belief in the supernatural now you are asking me to sabotage that achievement to send them back into the dark ages of superstition and ignorance and fear no we will find some way to undo the damage weve caused number one tell me about this groups leader
nuria exceptionally clearminded sensible the mintakans trust her judgment if we can convince her that you are not a god
she might be able to persuade the others
and how do you propose to convince her
she believes the picard is a magical figure im going to show her how the magic works im going to bring her aboard

counsellor sensors indicate five mintakans in your immediate vicinity four are motionless the fifth is eight meters away proceeding south is nuria one of these five
mmm hmm

was that intended to be an affirmative
yes data it was
is nuria the closest of the five
uh un
negative

is nuria the one in motion
mmm hmm

lock sensors on nuria
locked on we can beam nuria aboard at will
data when sensors indicate shes alone beam her directly to transporter room one
aye sir

ensign hoy
captain nuria is alone
ill handle this

nuria dont be afraid no one is going to harm you
who
i am jean luc picard

please get up get up you must not kneel to me
you do not wish it
i do not deserve it look at me look at me feel the warmth of my hand the rhythm of my pulse im not a supreme being im flesh and blood like you
not like me
like you different in appearance yes but we are both living beings we are born we grow we live and we die in all the ways that matter we are alike
but you are the picard
there is something i want you to see

what a wondrous place even the walls obey your command
wondrous yes but not miraculous the doors merely work differently from the ones you know

that is my home
seen from far far above
yet we do not fall i never imagined i would see the clouds from the other side your powers are truly boundless
nuria your people live in huts was it always so
no we have found remnants of tools in caves our ancestors must have lived there
so why do you now live in huts
huts are better caves are dark and wet
if huts are better why did you once live in caves
the most reasonable explanation would be that at one time we didnt know how to make huts
just as at one time you did not know how to weave cloth how to make a bow
that would be reasonable
someone invented a hut someone invented a bow who taught others who taught their children who built a stronger hut built a better bow who taught their children now nuria suppose one of your cave dwelling ancestors could see you as you are today what would she think
i dont know
put yourself in her place you see she cannot kill a hornbuck at a great distance you can you have a power she lacks
only because i have a bow
shes never seen a bow it doesnt exist in her world to you its a simple tool to her its magic
i suppose she might think so
now how would she react to you
i think she would fear me
just as you fear me
i do not fear you any longer
good thats good you see my people once lived in caves and then we learned to build huts and in time to build ships like this one nuria perhaps one day my people will travel above the skies
of that i have absolutely no doubt


its not the season for lightning it must be a warning
weve had storms like this before
not like this one
it must mean something the picard is angry with us he blames us for letting palmer escape
liko we dont know that the overseer is responsible for this storm
will he also send floods my wife died in last years floods will we all die now we must find nuria

picard you have shown me wonders i could never have imagined and i am grateful beyond words might i request something for my people
you are indeed a leader
you have shown me such generosity i wish my people could share in it six mintakans died in a flood last winter four of them children would you bring them back to life
that is not in my power
why you restored likos life did the six who died offend you in some way did i offended you should i have ordered the death of troi please you must tell me if theres anything i can do to change your mind
ive failed to get through to you havent i despite all my efforts

nuria cant be found no one knows where shes gone
hali any sign of palmer or riker
they have escaped us we searched everywhere
what do we do now father
we must do as the picard wishes punish those responsible
nuria would not allow us to
nuria isnt here we cant wait


crusher to picard i think were going to lose warren
on my way
im here mary

prepare two ccs of norep

im sorry

picard you could not save her
no
you do have limits you are not masters of life and death
no we are not we can cure many diseases and we can repair injuries we can even extend life but for all our knowledge all our advances we are just as mortal as you are were just as powerless to prevent the inevitable
you are a remarkable people but you are not superior beings my people must be made to understand that

liko you dont want to kill me
i have no choice i must do as the picard wishes
are you sure you know what he wants thats the problem with believing in a supernatural being trying to determine what he wants
we must do something
but what if we do the wrong thing father
picard we need your guidance is it your wish that this woman should die answer us speak

liko
the picard the overseer has come
no liko liko i am a man i am not the overseer i am a traveller from a faraway land nothing more
but you have restored my life i am your servant
you are no ones servant liko i neither desire your obedience nor your worship
picard speaks the truth i have visited his people i have seen how they live and how they die when death takes one of their loved ones they are as helpless as we are
then how was i brought back to life
liko you were not dead picards people have a knowledge that we lack they are able to heal wounds that we cannot
no no he can bring back the dead show them picard you can bring my wife back to me
i cannot
why why wont you do this for me have i failed you in some way are you angry with me
i am not angry with you
then i beg you bring her back to me i will give you my life in exchange please take back what you gave me give it to her let her live
it is beyond my power
nothing is beyond your power you are the overseer i will prove it

liko
if you believe i am allpowerful then you cannot hurt me if however i am telling the truth and i am mortal you will kill me but if the only proof you will believe is my death then shoot
liko dont do it
father no

captains log supplemental doctor crusher has repaired my injury with her usual skill mister la forge will supervise the dismantling of the observation post after i make one last visit to mintaka three


now mister la forge
aye sir

what is that
a place where we can watch your people
but why
to study you to understand your ways discontinue mister la forge

picard why should a people so advanced want to learn about us
we were once as you are now to study you is to understand ourselves
but why did you have to hide yourself from us
because their presence would affect us just as it affected me
it is our highest law that we shall not interfere with other cultures
then revealing yourselves was an accident
oh yes and now we must leave you
why theres so much you can teach us
but that too would be interference you must progress in your own way
so we will you have taught us there is nothing beyond our reach
not even the stars
pahkee

i wish you good journeys picard remember my people
always

commander away team reporting in lieutenant worf standing by
this is riker go ahead lieutenant
the archeologists have identified the markings in these caverns this planet was apparently once home to a race known as the koinonians
what do we know about them data
the koinonians were an intelligent culture which became embroiled in a war that lasted for several generations our best evidence indicates they destroyed themselves
we have completed our survey of the third tunnel and will proceed into the ceremonial chamber
affirmative enterprise out
destroyed themselves data
according to historical records this will be the first opportunity for a federation team
captain beam them up quickly
captain emergency beam up enterprise emergency severe injuries
transporter room
ive got them captain
beam them straight to sickbay doctor crusher incoming wounded


away team is aboard captain

one dead on arrival
captains log stardate  the enterprise remains in standard orbit while we investigate the tragedy which has struck the away team lieutenant marla aster ships archaeologist has been killed in what should have been a routine mission whatever the explanation it will not bring back a valued and trusted officer

lieutenant
we had completed our investigation of the third tunnel our scans had indicated no weapons or traps of any kind lieutenant aster was three metres behind me an explosive device went off there was no warning lieutenant aster bore the full brunt of the detonation

lieutenant aster is survived by a son jeremy twelve years old hes aboard the enterprise sir
and his father
hes also deceased his only living relatives are an aunt and uncle residing on earth
where is he now
in class ive alerted the teacher to expect us
captain i must accompany you i commanded the away team
i appreciate your offer lieutenant but this is my responsibility

picard to bridge
yes captain
assign commander la forge to lead another away team to the dig site i want to know why this happened
yes captain
i will be with counsellor troi

and young jeremy aster
i understand riker out
he had to do the same thing for me
do you know jeremy well
but i know this is going to be like for him
thats part of life in starfleet wesley
i know theyre very careful to prepare us for anything but still
i know
how do you get used to it telling them
you hope you never do



i sense the weight of this duty on you captain
i really wonder halt ive always believed that carrying children on a starship is a very questionable policy serving on a starship means accepting certain risks certain dangers did jeremy aster make that choice
death and loss are an integral part of life everywhere leaving him on earth would not have protected him
no but earth isnt likely to be ordered to the neutral zone or to repel a romulan attack it was my command which sent his mother to her death she understood her mission and my duty will he
in time and with help wesley crusher does he does and so will jeremy
resume

jeremy i have some bad news there has been an accident your mother has died
how sir
an explosive device at the mission site she died instantly
i understand
jeremy i know your mother loved you very much
im told that your father is also dead
yes sir he died five years ago from a rushton infection im all alone now sir
jeremy on the starship enterprise no one is alone no one

excuse me sir am i intruding
no sit down
how well did you know lieutenant aster
we spent some time together not very well how well did you know her
why do you ask
well you just asked me
but why do you ask the question since her death i have been asked several times to define how well i knew lieutenant aster and i heard you ask wesley on the bridge how well he knew jeremy does the question of familiarity have some bearing on death
do you remember how we all felt when tasha died
i do not sense the same feelings of absence that i associate with lieutenant yar although i cannot say precisely why
just human nature data
human nature sir
we feel a loss more intensely when its a friend
but should not the feelings run as deep regardless of who has died
maybe they should data maybe if we felt the loss of any life as keenly as we felt the death of those close to us human history would be a lot less bloody
la forge to riker
youre back geordi
yes sir and weve brought back a souvenir

there are five more just like them all identical to the one that killed lieutenant aster
they employ a subspace proximity detonator a normal tricorder would never detect it
how long would you say theyve been there data
it comes from the time of the koinonian wars sir
did you find them all geordi
yeah but well it seemed like they were left there to be found
left by whom there are no indications of life on this planet
i dont know captain but it was pretty obvious that theyd been recently pulled out of the ground and defused

i have made my report to the captain
im more interested in how you feel about what happened i sense great anger
i cannot seek revenge against an enemy whos turned to dust centuries ago her death was senseless the last victim of a forgotten war
go on
theres nothing more to be said
a person died under your command it may happen again if you cant learn to release the anger and the guilt to talk about it
a leader must stand alone as captain picard does
captain picard talks to me
then may i seek your counsel about my plan to make the ruustai with the boy
the bonding
it is my right
its very generous worf but hes not a klingon child he has different sensibilities
he is an orphan i am an orphan he will understand
right now there isnt much he can understand hes holding all his feelings inside children often feel they must be true to the memory of a lost parent if you offer affection to them too soon they can feel guilty returning that affection as if theyre betraying the love of the parent
i only wish to honour his mother
i know and i understand this means a great deal to you but you must be prepared hes very angry too but his anger is deep inside him when he touches it it will strike out in many directions including yours be with him talk to him but dont rush this when hes ready well know


captain patches an alien ship on the surface whats it made of captain oh no weve been hit captain were going down
that was great now lets get a shot of mom
what are you doing ill turn your lens into  shards go away go away go away over there over there

patches captain patches is coming in for a landing on the sofa

oh no hes going to crash
jeremy aster im lieutenant worf may i enter
you were in command of the away team
yes i was with lieutenant aster your mother when she died
youre a klingon arent you
yes
we studied about klingons in school
what did they teach you about us
you used to be our enemies
did they also teach you that every klingon hopes to die in the line of duty as your mother did in my tradition we do not grieve the loss of the body we celebrate the releasing of the spirit
i understand death they teach us all about it
jeremy aster we may both understand it but we must bring meaning to your mothers death perhaps we can do it together

come counsellor hows the boy
hes being very brave
good
no he has to get past brave hes very angry and he has to learn how to express that anger before he can really say goodbye to his mother
how can we help
well ive asked beverly if we might get wesley to talk to jeremy about his fathers death the one unusual element is worf
oh
in many ways hes suffering as badly as the boy he wishes to involve jeremy in a klingon ceremony called ruustai the bonding
i know of that perhaps it will be helpful to both of them
i dont think jeremys ready to accept worf right now perhaps later but it will have to be handled most delicately
as you always do i break the unpleasant news and there my responsibility ends but you you have to stay with them through the entire grieving process
we deal with our pain in many different ways but over the years ive discovered it is in our joy that the uniqueness of each individual is revealed if i can help a person back to a state of joy well my role has its rewards
captain were picking up an energy field on the planet surface

location
two kilometres north of the away teams beamdown point
indeed full scan
inconclusive captain
sir i sensing a presence on the planet very vague
life form
i cant be sure the emotions of the crew are particularly strong right now its difficult to filter them out
data scan analysis on main viewer


hi
hi troi stopped by a little while ago she was wondering if you might be willing to talk to jeremy aster at some point
me what for
about your dad
what am i going to tell him
it would help him to talk with someone whos been through this we had each other wes he doesnt have anyone to lean on right now and he might be more comfortable talking to someone whos not much older than he is
okay ill think about it
okay
do you ever think about him mom
your father sure i do
sometimes i cant even remember what his face looks like it scares me
it happens to all of us wes sometimes i cant get his face out of my mind
today today its like i can see it all as clearly as if it were yesterday i can remember the way dad looked when he hugged me goodbye captain picards eyes when he came to tell us


data run comparison of known phenomena
the pattern has no exact match in federation records sir
is it alive
a possibility
captain im getting an unusual magnetic flux reading from the antimatter containment pods
my god


wait a minute wait a minute okay youve got ten seconds more mom no peeking come on patches in here shh okay mom were ready
jeremy im getting closer jeremy im going to find you you must be in here somewhere
jeremy
mom

all systems are functioning normally still theres this fluctuation in the containment field i cant account for it
data is this possibly related to the energy fields on the planet
captain
there is a beam of highly charged particles emanating from the planet sir but i cannot pinpoint the location yet
captain theres a presence on the enterprise
an alien presence
no intruder noted by the sensors sir
there is a presence
security all decks yellow alert possible intruder


they said you were dead
there was a mistake its okay
but there was an explosion you were hurt
im fine you mustnt think any more about this the important thing is im never going to leave you again i think somebody needs a hug

we have to go now
where
to the planet thats where were going to live now
were not going to stay on the enterprise any more
no were going to live in a home just like we used to on earth youll see i promise

lieutenant worf did they tell you it was a mistake she didnt die shes alive
jeremy come here
lieutenant worf its all right im here for the boy
lieutenant worf to captain picard

go ahead
lieutenant aster is in her quarters
repeat worf

lieutenant aster is here in her quarters with the boy
do not provoke her

or interfere in any way until i arrive picard out number one have security moving that way but tell them to keep their distance you have the bridge counsellor

there is nothing to worry about im going to take care of jeremy and make him happy its time to go
where are you taking the child
to the planet
come jeremy

worf to picard theyre leaving their quarters

captain i believe were headed for transporter room three
were on our way

chief obrien jeremy and i are going down to the surface

who are you
im marla aster
its my mother captain shes alive
what do you want
to take my child down to the planet
i cannot permit that the boy is my responsibility
im here to care for him he needs me why do you resist
because i dont know who or what you are
cant you see who it is captain
jeremy she appears to be your mother but she is not
what do you mean
youre confusing the boy

hey wait stop no no wait stop

mom mom
jeremy
wait a minute let go of me she was right there

what did you do to her
jeremy i dont know what that was but it was not your mother
you saw her she was here
your mothers dead
but i touched her she was real
why would your real mother want you to go down to the planet theres nothing there but dust and rocks


its my house its my house on earth
exactly the way it was remember jeremy
how did you do it
does it matter
yes it matters
i am trying to understand your resistance you spoke of rocks and dust on the planet i decided to show you what awaits us there
why would you create this fantasy
its his home and it makes you happy doesnt it
but its not real
isnt it jeremy isnt that really patches

he knows me its him its real its all real
no its not could your real mother just make all this appear you must not stay here come with me
i cant

is the boy in any danger
i dont think so she seems to want to help him
help him

by easing his pain shes very confused by our resistance captain

troi would it be wise to remove jeremy from his cabin
he doesnt want to leave i would not recommend taking him

by force
she offers him everything all we offer is the cold reality of his mothers death
what would you choose if somebody came along and offered to give you back your mother father or husband would any of us say no so easily
counsellor stay with them in jeremys quarters

well try and put an end to this from here
understood

data can you determine for certain that the energy source from the planet is powering this creation
the beam from the planet is clearly tapping into the ships antimatter captain
id say theyre running the manifestation off our own energy
so there are limits to her power
she needs the transporter to get the boy back
so how do we cut the puppets strings
increasing the shield harmonics to match our own antimatter containment fields will probably sever the beam
proceed
deanna stand by
standing by

jeremy its time for this to end its not real and its over now
jeremy im not going to leave you ever again
i wont trick you or lie to you
well be happy together jeremy as soon as

no

antimatter containment pods reading nominal
the shield has severed the beam sir captain the energy field

mister crusher take us out of here


alien intruder transporter room three security alert alien


security to transporter room three
commander la forge mister worf come with me number one you have the bridge




come jeremy we will not let them separate us again were going home

captain shes back shes trying to take jeremy off the ship again
acknowledged
engineering this is la forge shut down power to all transporters im on my way
aye aye sir
lieutenant worf to transporter room three

bridge seal off deck eight corridors a and b

engaging force fields captain transporters down

energy force has left transporter room three security alert all decks

la forge the intruder may try to reinstate

transporter power
understood commander


bridge release security forcefield eight b hello jeremy how are you are you frightened
no well a little sir
of course these are frightening things that are happening but we wont let anyone harm you counsellor why dont you take the boy to my quarters
no

its looking over everything commander going to school lets just hope it doesnt blow us to kingdom come while its figuring out how to blow us to kingdom come


powers back in transporter room three

bypassing the manual override shutting it down

transporter is down again
keep it down geordi for as long as you can
understood commander

it is only a matter of time captain before we can power the transporters ourselves
we for whom else do you speak
the accident on the surface was caused by a remnant of an ancient and tragic era two species once shared this world one of energy and one of matter the physical beings you call the koinonians destroyed themselves in unending bitter wars the surviving life forms on this world will not tolerate any further suffering as a result of that dishonourable past so they have made this possible they have made me possible
i appreciate your motives but his mother is dead he must learn to live with that
i will be every bit his mother
but not his mother picard to lieutenant worf
go ahead captain
will you escort ensign crusher to the aster quarters
yes sir
picard out
your philosophy is curious captain what is so noble about sorrow i can provide him an existence where he will feel no pain no anguish
it is at the heart of our nature to feel pain and joy it is an essential part of what makes us what we are
he is alone now in your world a child alone how can you know he wont be happier with me
for a brief moment in time he surely would be any of us in his place would be
what would jeremy do for friends in your world
he will have any friends he needs
and will you provide for his education his health his growth a career a wife
yes its quite an undertaking youre proposing isnt it
it is our duty to make him happy again
do you honestly believe he would be happy in this total fiction which you wish to create what reason would he have to live what youre offering him is a memory something to cherish not to live in it is part of our life cycle that we accept the death of those we love jeremy must come to terms with his grief he must not cover it or hide away from it you see we are mortal our time in this universe is finite that is one of the truths that all human must learn
acting ensign crusher reporting as ordered sir
yes come in wesley please stay lieutenant jeremy wesleys father died on a starfleet mission when he was younger than you are
wes your mother told me you were finding it difficult to talk to jeremy why is that
i dont know i just didnt want to think about it any more all this has reminded me so much of that day
the day i told you your father had been killed as i recall wesley you took it very well
my parents taught me about the dangers of starfleet missions i knew what could happen
so you were prepared
no i wasnt prepared at all how could anyone be prepared to hear that a parent is never coming home again i tried to be what everybody expected of me brave and mature
wesley are you saying that you didnt want anybody to see what you were really feeling what were you really feeling
like somebody had kicked me in the head
somebody
go on youve wanted to tell him for a long time
i was angry at you
why angry why were you angry at me wesley were you angry at me because i was the one who told you your father was dead
no
then why
because you led the mission you came home and my father didnt
how long were you angry with the captain wes
for a long time but not any more sir not even a little
so jeremy you must be very angry at lieutenant worf he was in charge of your mothers mission just as captain picard was in command when wesleys father was killed isnt that right worf came back your mother didnt

why why werent you the one who died why did it have to be her
he cant answer that none of us can
lieutenant worf also lost his parents
they were killed in battle when i was six when i was alone humans helped me let me help you the marla aster i knew and honoured is not in this room nor does she await you on the planet now she lives only here and here  join me in the ruustai the bonding you will become part of my family now and for all time we will be brothers



sos jih batlh soh
what does that mean
it honours the memory of our mothers we have bonded and our families are stronger
sos jih batlh soh
booby trap



another coconono
no thanks i think ive had enough already
yeah yeah me too oh i almost forgot

geordi im sorry i think id better go back
too chilly i can turn down the breeze
no its been a lovely programme
yeah
and youre a terrific guy
yeah
i just dont feel that way about you
yeah  knock it off


this was the final battle wasnt it
neither side intended orelious nine to be the decisive conflict
theres not much left is there
the destruction is remarkable considering the primitive weapons of the period

uh oh
i beg your pardon wesley
geordi had a big date with christy tonight he spent days putting together the perfect programme looks like it ended kind of early
uh oh
commander data to the bridge immediately
acknowledged

were picking up a signal coordinates two one one mark six one
it would seen to be an ancient interplanetary code mister data
confirmed sir
survivors on orelious nine after all this time not possible
well hardly possible number one lay in a course to the source of the signal

approaching the source captain
put it on the viewer
a promellian battle cruiser
with its langcycle fusion engines still intact
sensors indicate no life signs aboard captain
i should hope not mister data that ship belongs in a museum im afraid were a little late that call for help was probably initiated over a thousand years ago
captains log stardate  we have arrived at orelious nine to chart the battle in which the menthars and promellians fought to their mutual extinction among the ruins we have found a relic a promellian battle cruiser that has withstood the centuries

indulge me number one
i would prefer it if lieutenant worf and i were able to a security sweep of the ship first
no captains prerogative this ones mine we have examined every conceivable risk
the risks on a ship this old and fragile are inconceivable captain
ghosts perhaps number one have you never dreamed of climbing inside the bottle
sir
the ship in the bottle model air ships i used to build them when i was a child my god i bet i had a promellian battle cruiser too

ready to beam down to the vessel
locked on to the main bridge captain
youre certain about the atmospheric conditions data 
there is adequate oxygen for life support commander
it is exactly as they left it number one in the bottle the ship in the bottle good lord didnt anybody here build ships in bottles when they were boys
i did not play with toys
i was never a boy
i did sir
thank you mister obrien proceed

i did i really did ships in bottles great fun

whats that
im not sure the secondary power bus may need adjusting
keep me posted


extraordinary
admirable they died at their posts
hmm youd expect the bridge layout of this era to be clumsy awkward but look at this its a model of simplicity elegant functional they built this craft for generations and it worked

dont you have anything stronger than this guinan
yes
would it help
no
tell me something guinan youre a woman right
yes i can tell you im a woman
what is it that you want in a man
me personally
as a woman whats the first thing you look at
his head
his mind of course
no his head im attracted to bald men
seriously
seriously
why
maybe because a bald man was very kind to me once when i was hurting took care of me
id like to do that
i take care of myself these days
i mean take care of somebody i just dont get it guinan i can field strip a fusion reactor i can realign a power transfer tunnel why cant i make anything work with a woman like christi its like i dont know what to do i dont know what to say
youre doing fine with me
youre different
no youre different
but im not trying now
thats my point

what is it wes
the main power returner is acting a little weird
define weird
im getting fluctuating waveguide readings
run a maintenance sweep
right

activating power pack captain
mister worf be sure we get tricorder images of their tactical display
aye sir
the source of the distress signal appears to be coming from up there captain
lets put an end to their last cry for help
captain i believe this is an information storage device a crude analogue of our isolinear optical chip
crude by our standards today data but when this ship was built humans on earth were just perfecting the mechanical clock still using steel crossbows in battle is there any way to see whats on this
questionable sir i believe i can supply power to its playback unit but its components are quite old i will attempt to amplify its image with my tricorder
i am galek sar captain of the promellian cruiser cleponji i wish anyone who finds this record to know my crew has behaved courageously i want it recorded for all time that i alone am responsible for the fate that befell us i have failed as a captain and as the man responsible for all the souls aboard my ship
picard to enterprise
go ahead captain
i think we have seen all there is to see here at mister obriens leisure were ready to return
aye sir

thrilling that was absolutely thrilling and i was right number one there were ghosts aboard that old ship one of them actually spoke to us
a friendly one i hope
my own counterpart the captains final message praising his crew
i hope youll be as thoughtful when the time comes
mister data advise the astral five annex this should be catalogued and scheduled for retrieval
aye sir

im sorry captain its just a rare pleasure to meet this side of your personality
mister crusher set course for the original coordinates
yes sir
captain we are experiencing a two percent drop in energy reserves compensating
we were having a few problems while
readouts indicate we are being bombarded with a field of high intensity radiation
shields up
captain energy loss increasing to five percent
yellow alert
aye sir
energy loss increasing sir
mister crusher reverse course full impulse power
no response sir
increase speed to warp one
engines are not responding captain
mister la forge

we need warp power now
matteranti matter mixture ratio settings at optimum balance reaction sequence corresponding to specified norms magnetic plasma transfer to warp field generators per programme specs commander we should be going like a bat out of hell

power loss now at twelve percent captain
red alert
radiation intensity increasing
wed better slow these engines down before we burn out the reaction chamber
slow to idle geordi
is it possible weve fallen into the same snare that killed them a thousand year old booby trap

with the engines idling the energy loss has been limited but our reserves will be depleted in less than three hours we wont be able to hold our shields in place
mister worf have you been able to identify the source of the radiation
no sir the radiation field is so strong it interferes with our sensors
and no apparent explanation for the energy loss
no sir
is there anything in the history books data that could give us a clue
there are many fascinating records of menthar battle strategy they were exceptionally innovative in fact they were the first to use the kavis teke elusive manoeuvre as well as the passive lure stratagem that is comparable to napoleons
any mention of a situation like this
no sir
i recommend that i return to the cruiser with an away team
they didnt have much success with this problem commander
no but they knew who their enemy was better than we do they may have known what caused the trouble they just didnt know how to get out
agreed mister worf what would be the impact of lowering the shields long enough to get the away team out
negligible
wont do much for our energy conservation captain
thats your job commander la forge determine some way to keep the enterprise up and running data you join commander riker on the away team find out what happened on that ship

so why cant we move computer as we increased our power levels was there any counterreaction
affirmative the opposing force grew in direct proportion to the power output of the enterprise
so it kept us from forming a subspace field for the warp drive
that is correct

computer who is this l brahms
doctor leah brahms engineer graduate of the daystrom institute theoretical propulsion group galaxy class starships team seven junior member
junior member huh looks like she wrote the book on propulsion call up subspace design logs
select menu visual records or l brahms voice entries
voice entries
theoretical propulsion logs federation starship enterprise galaxy class heading subspace author leah brahms
geordi la forge howre you doing doc
specify programme
yeah down to work youre absolutely right

i recommend we evacuate and seal off all nonoperational areas and group the families and crew on the oddnumbered decks
proceed
id also like to set up an assembly area for treating radiation symptoms in case its needed
after the shields fall how long before fatal exposure
thirty minutes after that there is nothing that can be done
away team to enterprise captain we may have found something theres a file of memory

coils here
they are identical to the coil we found earlier captain
the captains log perhaps
thats what we were thinking

mister data are they in working condition
i believe so sir

we can enhance them through the image processor in the ships computer

good return at once
aye sir

computer generate a cross section image of the dilithium crystal chamber what about reorienting the crystal
it is possible to reorient the crystal the key lies in adjusting the lattice structure direction this modification will be integrated into the next class starship
sorry cant wait you and me leah weve got just two hours to figure this thing out you know what i need to do i need to get inside there i need to be able to turn that thing inside out computer is there a cross section image we can replicate on a holodeck
select menu design specifications or prototype schematic
prototype elaborate
a development stage prototype schematic at utopia planitia drafting room five of the mars station stardate 
perfect recreate it in holodeck three stay with me doc

ready computer
holodeck three programme is ready


damn right back where it all started whoa this is incredible leah did you design this
the dilithium crystal chamber was designed at outpost designated seran t one stardate  some of the federations best engineering minds participated in its development
thats the visiting dignitary talk whats the inside story off the record
access denied personal logs are restricted
great another woman who wont get personal with me in the holodeck leah i want to find a way to supplement the energy supply to the ship and to the engines could we alter the matterantimatter paths
theoretically yes the system should be able to accept more reactants at a faster rate of injection
well this is your baby show me which ones

computer did i ask for a simulation
affirmative you asked doctor brahms to show you which system could accept reactants at a faster rate by accessing available imagery an adequate facsimile was possible
i did do that didnt i okay well its good to see you leah continue your analysis
systems l through l will accept reactants providing all other systems are calibrated to an equal factor
then if we use multiple injector streams hitting more than one crystal facet we could do it we could hold our own leah youre beautiful la forge to picard
go ahead
captain weve found a way to extend the matterantimatter energy supplies

well done mister la forge
geordi can you give us enough power to get us out of here

sorry commander we havent addressed that one yet first priority was to maintain the shields

acknowledged
well get to work on it right away sir
pass my congratulations to the rest of your team

thanks captain were all smiles down here


captain weve been able to verify that these coils are the logs of the promellian captain but most of them have decayed and cannot be repaired
can you get any playback at all
on most there are brief sections which may yield some information
do the best you can data lets just hope we can get the section we need
surely he must have logged the cause of the ships death what captain wouldnt
all found in an open locker i dont think he was too concerned with security

 through system l
adjustments to dilithium crystal chamber complete
impact analysis computer
warp energy has increased fourteen percent reactants per unit time remaining steady
yes all right computer do you have any you know personality on file for doctor brahms
starfleet personality profile analysis stardate 
did she ever debate at the intergalactic caucuses on chaya seven
doctor brahms attended chaya seven caucuses on the following stardates
never mind the dates computer if you add data from all these sources could you synthesise a true representation of doctor brahms
there would be a nine point three seven percent margin of error in the interactive responses from the facsimile
i can live with that do it  doctor brahms
geordi its me leah dont start calling me doctor brahms or ill call you commander la forge
right
now weve managed to maintain energy but we cant leave it in this realignment forever without burning out components so we need to move quickly

are you with me
yeah yeah yeah

we have been stripped of all propulsion and our weapons are useless we cannot move and we cannot fight the ship is being lashed with lethal radiation from the aceton assimilators concealed in the wreckage surrounding the
aceton assimilators
aceton assimilators are a primitive generator which can drain power from distant sources
generators
it would not be difficult to modify them to convert energy into radiation
the menthars hide them in floating debris an unsuspecting enemy ship flies in instant booby trap
and now were supplying the devices with the energy to kill us

no no no
will you listen to me
you cant boost the warp power that way
you can just increase the speed of the parallel subspace field processor to gain a quicker response time
i want to give us enough power to strengthen the shields and barrel out of here not blow us up
this is my design were talking about i did all the calculations myself
i dont care if you built it with your bare hands out of an old ferengi cargo ship its going to go  and were going with it
i am not used to having people question my judgment
and im not used to dying okay look you worked in a lab on a static model this is a working machine its got tens of thousands of light years on it
true
damn right listen wed never be certain that the circuit paths are sealed
youre good very good
i know my ship inside and out
well then you must know me inside and out cos a lot of me is in here
you know i always wished that a chief engineer could be present when a ship is being built
thats whats wrong with designers we never get out in space
well youre there now
commander la forge to the bridge
on my way commander dont go away i mean computer save programme

how many devices do we think were dealing with mister data
to create this radiation field would take several hundred thousand sir
theyve been out there a long time data there must have been some deterioration
there is no way to precisely calculate that commander but it is likely
is there any indication of a weakness in a specific part of the field
nothing substantial captain
of any kind
there is a point one percent dip in the strength of the radiation field at two one mark eight by four two mark zero
i want that point one percent
i recommend we fire directional phasers at those coordinates
we wont be able to maintain energy reserves we might even lose a few circuits in the new configuration
how critical will the losses be
not enough to shut down our engines but if we dont make it i dont know that i can hold the shields
there is also the possibility that the phasers will supply the assimilators with what they need most energy
you know i imagine a very similar discussion taking place on our neighbour ship over a thousand years ago lets hope our decisions are more successful than theirs were mister la forge i want you to return to engineering and continue with your efforts without delay mister worf prepare the phasers
phasers locked on coordinates
fire
nothing
radiation levels increasing eight percent ten percent
energy reserves are dropping rapidly sir
damn you

wouldnt that increase the output of the subspace processors to gain a quicker response time
the processors can handle the extra input
yeah but how do we reconfigure
energy reserves reaching critical stage standard procedure requires termination of all simulations
computer override standard procedure
override authority restricted
what computer


the crystal lattice is breaking down well have to pick up repairs when we can reach a starbase
the optimist of the group
how long do we have shields based on current calculations
under two hours captain and the radiation field has increased by seventeen percent
so what impact will that have on fatal exposure
down to twenty six minutes
if we resist we die if we dont resist we die
mister la forge have we shut down all nonessential energy usage

yes sir in fact i need to get some back im running a programme on holodeck three

for what purpose
well ive gone back to the beginning

to the earliest construction entries of the enterprise ive created a propulsion design model to assist me

i believe were making progress
computer reinstate holodeck three programme
holodeck three programme is reinstated
mister la forge your best suggestion in an hour

picard out

computer resume holodeck three programme
enter when ready

there isnt much time left
somehow we have to generate enough energy to get out of here but weve got a booby trap that eats energy for breakfast how do we fool it block it shut it down anything okay we know for every movement the enterprise makes theres a counter movement by the energy field can we use that to our advantage somehow
maybe there must be a time differential between the force and counter force if we can just make quick continuing adjustments in the linkups before the counterforce reacts we might just be able to move this bucket
yeah yes  leah you like italian food
like it wait till i make you my fungilli
okay fusion reactor uplink to navigation processor

but then we have to adjust the vector processor and the drive coils this is impossible

dont do that
im sorry i thought it would feel good
i dont want to feel that good right now what time is it
coming up on sixteen hundred hours
god what am i supposed to tell the captain its possible and yet its not possible everything weve done says we cant adjust that fast but if we could it might work
i could do it
data couldnt even do it itll take a hundred maybe even a thousand adjustments every second how are you going to do it its humanly impossible
im not human
you mean the computer could do it

captain captain this is a holographic simulation of one of the propulsion experts who designed the enterprise engines leah brahms weve ive been examining the forcecounter force response times trying to see if we could create linkage at maximum power
and
theres a chance we could manoeuvre out of this trap if we turn the ship over to the computer
what kind of chance
i dont know yet but we could programme it and try it out on a few simulated runs
and this is the only way
i think so sir

come
any word from la forge
hes come up with something that may give us a chance if we agree to stay out of it he proposes to turn total control of the ship over to the computer because it is capable of making quicker adjustments than any human being
computers have always impressed me with their ability to take orders im not nearly as convinces of their ability to creatively give them
you know number one you missed something not playing with model ships they were the source of imaginary voyages each holding a treasure of adventures manning the earliest space craft flying a aeroplane with only one propeller to keep you in the sky can you imagine that now the machines are flying us

end simulation fatal exposure
computer reduce thrust levels another four percent adjust trajectory angle to compensate begin simulation again
there you go we got out
repeat simulation same levels
end simulation fatal exposure
you see same variables only this time the computer didnt quite make it

deflector shield failure lethal radiation levels fatal exposure in twenty six minutes
it might work geordi
and it might not i cant ask captain picard to turn the ship over to a computer
its all weve got
picard to la forge
captain

two minutes give me just two minutes

there is another way captain two minutes please

two minutes mister la forge picard out

geordi theres no other way
no no wait listen turn it completely around literally come at it from the opposite direction god its so simple it might even work okay computer new simulation

everything weve tried to do has been based on overpowering the trap more energy faster adjustments but thats exactly what we cant do because thats what were supposed to do thats the booby trap the answer lies in our own computer the mind the best piece of engineering well ever need
but didnt your researches indicate a thousand adjustments per second would be required
not if we shut everything off one blast of everything weve got left for a microsecond to beat the inertia and then we shut it all down except minimal life support and two thrusters no impulse engines no computer
one propeller captain
deflector shield failure lethal radiation levels fatal exposure in twelve minutes
have you analysed the risk factor
the numbers say its even money its no better than turning it over to the computer but no worse either but i say forget the numbers theres no way the computer can compensate for the human factor the intuition the experience
and the wish to stay alive make it so
ive run the simulations captain if you want ill take the conn
thank you mister la forge but youve done your job now i must do mine i relieve you mister crusher
yes sir
all hands this is commander riker we are about to engage impulse engines for a short burst inertial dampers are on manual they may not fully compensate for acceleration so brace yourselves
deflector shield failure lethal radiation levels
computer discontinue radiation warning till further notice its all yours sir
thank you number one firing impulse engines

impulse engines are down
shutting down all systems
velocity is one hundred thirty five metres per second
we will be entering the debris field in eight seconds
starboard thruster firing
coming to heading three four zero mark one zero
thruster is off
captain that large mass to port may contain an assimilator
port thrusters firing
no reaction from the assimilator
okay were over the first hurdle
sir object to port
port thruster is firing sir the gravitational attraction of the various masses has reduced our velocity by eight percent by my calculations we no longer have sufficient momentum to clear the debris field
thank you mister data
the asteroids gravity is drawing us closer velocity is increasing velocity still increasing now at two hundred and nineteen metres per second starboard aft thruster you have used the asteroids gravitational pull as a slingshot excellent
were out we got through
you have the conn mister crusher
yes sir
initiate full restart put all systems back online
with pleasure sir
number one make sure that booby trap doesnt bother anyone again
mister worf ready photon torpedoes set to detonate on impact with the promellian vessel
aye sir


you know ive always thought that technology could solve almost any problem it enhances the quality of our lives lets us travel across the galaxy even gave me my vision but sometimes you have to turn it all off even the gypsy violins
violins
different programme
we made a good team
maybe we can do it again some time
im with you every day geordi every time you look at this engine youre looking at me every time you touch it its me

computer exit holodeck end programme
the enemy



placing beamout marker return transport fourteen minutes forty seconds is your view any better geordi
not too bad commander a lot of chargedparticle precipitation but i can compensate
communicators are dysfunctional
tricorders
readings only valid within five metres
good thing we didnt bring data wed be unscrambling his circuits for a week
commander picking up something on the positron scan over here some electrically conductive objects

recognise those markings worf
yes sir romulan
what the hell are they doing in a federation sector
picking up traces of ultritium residue an explosive device mustve been used to destroy the craft after it crashed
all right lets spread out twenty five metre radius our window back closes in twelve minutes

commander

commander riker

four minutes to beamup
where is he wait here


worf worf commander riker

geordi geordi

worf commander riker

hold your position mister worf


worf
captains log stardate  an unidentified distress signal has led to the discovery of a crashed romulan vessel on the surface of galorndon core a federation planet we have recovered one survivor but lieutenant commander la forge did not report back with the away team and is still missing

get him to sickbay
secure sickbay post a guard in visual contact at all times
hes not going anywhere lieutenant
im sorry commander theres just no way to lock in on anything down there
keep trying obrien
the electrical storms creating thousands of ghosts
well beam some of those ghosts back one of them may be geordi permission to lead another away team sir
denied when we get another window in the storms the crash site

the romulan craft is a total loss theres nothing there to salvage unless you want to use tweezers
no sign of others
you couldnt see two metres in front of yourself down there
it certainly is the last place one would expect romulan encroachment on the other hand galorndon core would provide ideal cover for an opening move of a new offensive
i doubt if they were there for the climate




we thought it would be like working on vulcans but there are subtle differences too many of them
can you treat him
he has cell damage to vital areas hes going to need a transfusion of compatible ribosomes in order to recover im setting up a schedule to test every member of the crew
we cant use the replicator
the molecules are too complex
will he survive
i cant answer that yet
well let me put it another way will he survive long enough to tell us what he was doing here
doctor its an important consideration
i can bring him around for a few minutes but there is one serious complication his brainwaves indicate early neuralpathway degeneration
head injury
theres no obvious cranial trauma im guessing his exposure to the magnetic fields on the surface was slowly breaking down his synaptic connections
will it affect geordi the same way

hell be conscious for a minute or two
you are on board the federation starship enterprise were treating your injuries how long were you down on galorndon core do you understand me
i will not answer questions
we need to know if there are other survivors on the surface
i am alone i will not answer any questions
do you have a mother ship who should be advised of your condition

the only answer he wants to give is that he was alone
which suggests that he wasnt



something anything to can cut through the storm some way to get a signal through to him
a neutrino pulse we could build a portable neutrino source and send it in a probe to the planet surface itll act like a beacon
a neutrino pulse would send noncharged particles back up through the atmosphere and would be detectable by geordis visor
he can show us that hes found it by modifying the pulse
make it so
captain i have a new transmission on a parallel frequency to the distress call
from the surface
no sir from inside the romulan zone we should be able to view the transmission
on screen

tomalak to pi we have received your distress signal respond if you can hear me we are entering the neutral zone now we will reach you in six hours
mister worf hail the romulan vessel
hailing frequencies open sir
romulan vessel this is captain jeanluc picard of the federation starship enterprise
the frequency is open sir
commander tomalak we have intercepted your transmission you are not to enter federation space
captain picard my apologies had i known you were in this sector i certainly would have advised you before crossing the neutral zone
indeed
im sure you will understand when i explain one of our ships had a slight navigational error and apparently crashed on galorndon core
a slight navigational error nearly half a light year past the neutral zone
i assure you captain no aggression was intended
commander we have recovered one of your survivors
he is on board your ship
he is being treated for severe injuries
and his craft
destroyed deliberately after the crash
im sure you are prepared to leave at once and rendezvous with me in the neutral zone
i have an away team on the planet we are waiting for a window in the storm to beam them up
and then you will return my officer
are there any other romulans we should be looking to recover from galorndon core
no it was a oneman craft captain we will be at the federation border of the neutral zone in roughly five hours we will expect you to rendezvous at that time

counsellor
theres great hostility behind his smile hell stop at nothing to complete his mission
including the neutral zone border
captain i see no reason to return the romulan to his ship he should be held and interrogated
we have every right to detain him sir
without evidence of intent number one it will not be a simple matter
it obviously wasnt pilots error i think it demands a response from us
but we must measure our response carefully or history may remember galorndon core along with pearl harbour and station salem one as the stage for a bloody preamble to war

i want him off all the drugs theyre not doing anything doctor crusher to picard
go ahead doctor
my patient is not responding

to treatment
you havent found a compatible ribosome donor
the lab is still processing the tests early results indicate humans have far

too many biorejection factors ive also ruled out the vulcans weve tested

i think ill try a little oldfashioned country medicine keep the fever down try to let the body heal itself
keep me advised picard out
captain the neutrino beacon is operational and weve placed it aboard a class three probe
well done ensign mister worf launch the probe
aye aye sir

probe has reached the surface sir
the neutrino stream is coming in strongly sensors are tracking the probe despite the interference


a stationary neutrino source wesley crusher thank you wesley

you are my prisoner
right congratulations surely a strategic triumph for the romulan empire
stay there
my shoes are getting full of sand i just hate that dont you
name and rank
lieutenant commander geordi la forge i dont think i got yours
a romulan ship will arrive shortly you will accompany me on board
i dont think so you see we heard your message too and well the fleets in commodore skys full of federation ships
youre lying
i never lie when ive got sand in my shoes commodore
get up
seriously the only one way out of here is for you to put that thing down and soon as theres a window in the storm


are you okay

you gotta be kidding
sit
welcome to galorndon core where no good deed goes unpunished

yes doctor
lieutenant good come in please sit down we have finally found a compatible ribosome match for the romulan but only one you
that is impossible i am a klingon
different species yes but many humanoids have comparable cell structures and you have what this romulan needs theres absolutely no risk to you you did understand that was the purpose of all the testing
i have no objection to tests
you have an objection to being a donor
yes
lieutenant i understand your feelings about the romulans but this is not the time or place
if you had seen them kill your parents you would understand doctor it is always the time and place for those feelings
this romulan didnt murder your parents and you are the only one who can save his life
then he will die

i sure wish youd put that away
youre afraid of dying
you bet i am who isnt
im not
right
to die in the service of my people
ah the romulan path to glory
you can be sarcastic now but in a few millennia when humans are extinct and the romulan empire spans the galaxy
you really believe that stuff dont you commodore
you may address me as centurion bochra
bochra good solid romulan name whats the matter
nothing
wrong your heart rate just shot way up  it translates a wide range of radiation into neural impulses allows me to see
without it youre blind
yes
how did this happen
i was born that way
and your parents let you live
what kind of question is that of course they let me live
no wonder your race is weak you waste time and resources on defective children
whoa i must be having some sort of polarity shift the diagnostic insists everythings fine hey hey your body temperatures gone up another full point
what are you saying
i dont know it must be this place all that electromagnetic soup its wreaking havoc on our nervous systems your metabolisms messed up sos my interface with the visor weve got to get out of here while we still can
sit down
bochra
sit down


what is that
its just a background fluctuation commander he hasnt found it yet
then he must be hurt or dead when does our next window open up mister data
there is no indication commander i have no way to predict
incoming romulan transmission captain
theyre early
the romulan warbird should still be twenty nine minutes away from the edge of the neutral zone
close enough however to see were not there on screen
picard im approaching the federation border and the enterprise is not to be found why
my away team is unable to leave the surface because of the storms
and my officer
he is alive
his life remains in jeopardy
yes
and yet you will still not permit me to cross into your precious federation space to retrieve him
if the point hasnt been made clearly commander let me make it again romulan warships do not enter federation space unless they are prepared to do battle
but a mission of mercy
a mission to recover one of your officers who has been caught on a federation planet for reasons as yet unknown
i have already explained
and i have rejected your explanation
territories you would measure territories against a mans life
commander i am singularly impressed by your concern for a life do not risk any more lives by leaving the neutral zone picard out

bochra bochra youre in bad shape and my visions getting worse now theres a beacon out there thatll get us back to my ship but not if i cant find it
i cannot surrender to the federation
then stay here and die
if the situation were reversed would you not die to avoid capture
i dont know i might if i thought it was necessary if the stakes were high enough but theyd have to be pretty damn high i guess id make a pretty lousy romulan huh
i no more wish to die than you do
bochra there are times when it is necessary to die for ones ideals do you believe this is one of those times

come on lets go find that beacon whoa
what is it
everythings gone blank im blind

come worf
you are busy forgive my intrusion
for what its worth i understand your bitterness
with respect sir you cannot i am asked to give up the very lifeblood of my mother and my father to those who murdered them
must you blame all romulans for that
yes
forever what if some day the federation made peace with the romulans
impossible
thats what your people said a few years ago about humans think how many died on both sides in that war would you and i be here now like this if we hadnt been able to let go of the anger and the blame where does it end worf if that romulan dies does his family carry the bitterness on another generation
then you believe i should
what i believe doesnt matter
my starfleet training tells me one thing but everything i am tells me another
lieutenant worf report to sickbay
acknowledged

lieutenant his life is coming to an end i thought it important for you to see him again its not too late to change your mind

come close to me klingon let me die with my hands at your throat
there is a substance within my cells which you need to survive
then youve come to hear me beg for my life
no
i would rather die than pollute my body with klingon filth

ive lost almost all feeling in my legs
my synapses must be turning to jelly the visors fine i just cant see a thing
how do we locate the beacon
we dont
do all humans give up so easily
bochra were lost unless youve got something that can smell neutrinos
we have the sensor device you are carrying
tricorder its not set up to detect neutrinos
your eye device does connect them
thats crazy they dont speak the same language besides id never be able to get an accurate sampling wait a second wait i wouldnt need an accurate sampling just need a pointer a neutrino geiger counter no its still not possible
you cannot do it
under normal circumstances maybe here no way
why
because i cant see adapting the neural output pods of the visor is tricky work it cant be done by touch
then i will be your eyes

the storm is beginning to subside captain we should have a window in less than an hour
theres still no indication that hes found the beacon sir
assemble an away team
yes sir
captain the romulan warship has crossed the neutral zone border it is in federation space and heading toward us
belay that order number one red alert

make sure the scanner select limiter matches the visor output range
not so fast
now place the neural output pods in contact with the tricorder scanner heads
ready
let her rip
bearing three five zero
we did it the first federationromulan coventure
the storm may be breaking
with any luck therell be an electromagnetic window opening up and we can get out of here
at which point ill be your prisoner
can you walk
i dont know
lets find out come on  okay lets go
straight ahead
okay
to the right

come
you wished to see me captain
yes lieutenant i assume you know what its about
yes
the romulan ship will reach us within the hour if our patient dies it may be just the excuse the romulan commander needs to start an incident the death of a romulan officer at the hands of the federation think of it
i have captain
so there is no question that the romulan officer is more valuable to us alive than dead
i understand
lieutenant sometimes the moral obligations of command are less than clear i have to weigh the good of the many against the needs of the individual and try to balance them as realistically as possible god knows i dont always succeed
i have not had cause to complain captain
oh lieutenant you wouldnt complain even if you had cause
if you order me to agree to the transfusion i will obey of course
i dont want to order you but i ask you i beg you to volunteer
i cannot
lieutenant
sir
that will be all

picard to doctor crusher
go ahead
do not continue to enlist the cooperation of lieutenant worf
i wont have to captain the romulan has died

weve found it
now we have to alter its signal pattern so the enterprise knows weve found it
will that be difficult
no not with your help

scanners are showing a window captain
expected duration
nine minutes forty seconds sir
no change in the neutrino beacon signal sir
romulan ship approaching bearing three fifty four mark two eight seven
on screen
entering phaser range we are being hailed sir
on viewer
you have one chance to escape destruction picard return my officer at once
commander you have entered federation space despite my warning
you forced the situation i will not leave without him
hes dead
then he is but the first to fall picard

the romulan ship is routing power to its forward disruptor array
all shields to maximum
aye sir
lock phasers on target
phasers locked and ready
captain the signal pattern from the neutrino beacon is modulating
its geordi
we cant transport him with the shields up
if we lower our shields the romulan will strike
the electromagnetic window on the planet is closing sir three minutes remain
transporter room lock onto the neutrino beam and stand by
standing by captain
the window is allowing intermittent sensor readings there are still numerous ghost images but i believe we are picking up two life forms near the beacon
another romulan
i cannot say the electromagnetic interference prevents an accurate reading
but its a likely hypothesis number one if commander la forge has located a second survivor lieutenant hail the romulan vessel
aye sir theyre ignoring our hail sir
repeat the hail all channels you see they have no way of knowing how accurate our sensors are put on your best poker face number one open a frequency commander tomalak it would appear our away team has rescued a second man from your one man ship were preparing to beam them to the enterprise after which of course we will return the survivor to you
no acknowledgement sir
commander both our ships are ready to fight we have two extremely powerful and destructive arsenals at our command our next actions will have serious repercussions we have good reason to mistrust one another but we have better reasons to set our differences aside now of course the question is who will take the initiative who will make the first gesture of trust the answer is i will i must lower our shields to beam these men up from the planet surface once the shields are down you will of course have the opportunity to fire on us if you do you will destroy not only the enterprise and its crew but the ceasefire that the romulans and the federation now enjoy lieutenant lower the shields leave the hailing frequency open
yes sir shields down
mister obrien transport mister la forge and the romulan directly to the bridge
aye sir energising

security team to the bridge
belay that order lieutenant shields up no one is going to harm you
you have my word on that
well commander
if he has been in any way mistreated
i have given them no information commander but i have not been mistreated in fact this human saved my life
tomalak how is it possible you didnt know of the second romulan on galorndon core
a simple misunderstanding captain picard i was obviously misinformed as to the size of the craft i assure you i intended no deception
of course not
you doubt my good faith
lets just say my faith would be strengthened by a gesture from you such as powering down your disruptors
disruptors powering down
thank you cancel red alert lieutenant commander we shall return your officer and escort your ship to the neutral zone
that is acceptable

good to have you back commander
good to be back sir actually i have centurion bochra to thank for it
indeed commander la forge and lieutenant worf escort our guest to transporter room one
yes sir come on
close call
too close number one brinksmanship is a dangerous game
the price



computer dispatches

listen
picard to counsellor troi
now what yes captain

the pleasure of your company is requested counsellor were having a little impromptu reception for the arriving delegates

captain im not really dressed for a reception
oh counsellor

just throw on any old thing were about to get our first look at the wormhole
of course captain im on my way

god forbid i should miss my first look at the wormhole

may i escort you miss troi
just tell me theres some chocolate here
ah counsellor troi will you allow me to do the introductions this is premier bhavani of barzan counsellor deanna troi
your discovery has produced a great deal of excitement premier
hopefully it will also produce a new era of prosperity for my people
well see to that
you know mister mendoza the federation negotiator
a pleasure to see you again counsellor troi
this is a worthy federation competitors in the bidding leyor of the caldonians

madame
and im devinoni ral

ships counsellor deanna troi
my good friend ral is the best hired gun in the business
hired gun
my good friend mendoza means that im a negotiator who serves a variety of clients on this particular occasion i represent the chrysalians
i believe its almost time isnt it captain
indeed it will be visible directly ahead
is it always on time bhavani
always we see it every two hundred and thirty three minutes our scientists say its due to radiation buildup in the accretion disk the visible burst is very brief

there it is ladies and gentlemen the first and only stable wormhole known to exist its yours for the right price

captains log stardate  we are orbiting barzan two which is entertaining bids for control of what appears to be a stable wormhole which could provide a permanent shortcut to the distant gamma quadrant

and as you all know the environment on my planet is completely inhospitable to most other life forms so id like to express my appreciation to you captain picard for hosting these negotiations the barzan has been a society dependent on others for generations we want that to end the appearance of this stable wormhole in our space provides us with our first true natural resource we have neither the experience nor the technology to exploit it but you do
excuse me theres a delegation of ferengi who wishes to be beamed aboard sir
were you expecting the ferengi premier
no but i do not wish to create ill will captain if they are interested in bidding i have no objection
chief obrien this is captain picard will you beam the ferengi directly to the observation lounge
aye sir

on behalf of all ferengi i protest why were we not invited to these negotiations
my apologies we did not anticipate your interest youre welcome to join us
my name is daimon goss these are my consuls kol and doctor arridor well need chairs
im captain jeanluc picard of the enterprise im serving as host for these proceedings
good then see to it that we get chairs
let me explain
fine fine just have your klingon servant get us some chairs
i am in charge of security
then who gets the chairs
daimon due to the delicate nature of these negotiations all parties have agreed that one representative would suffice now i will be happy to provide your consuls with accommodations and you may have my chair
very well
premier

kol the bag
gentlemen this way
we can handle all the pleasantries later now lets get down to business

ill match anyones best offer and add the gold on top of it

devinoni ral human age forty one born brussels european alliance relocated at age nineteen to hurkos three
come in
should i call for an appointment 
no i was just looking over some personnel files
well thats too bad i thought you might be thinking about me
i thought youd be deep in negotiations by now
in recess i never play the opening rounds anyway inconsequential besides there are much better things to negotiate on this ship like dinner tonight
what about your travelling companion
my travelling companion is travelling i sent her home
why
you know why
werent you getting along
dont do that
what
dont do counsellor troi
was i
yes you were when you leave this office who are you oh so thats how it goes you never do you never do leave the office
what
shush

dinner at eight

the data from the barzans probe of the wormhole are quite impressive captain the wormhole delivered the probe beyond the denkiri arm in the gamma quadrant
it would take nearly a century at warp nine to cover that distance
the same distance could be achieved in a matter of seconds through the wormhole
imagine the ferengi collecting tolls if we lose to them
i dont think the ferengi are the greatest threat at the table with all of daimon goss bluster they dont have the resources the barzans need
i think that devinoni is the one that we need to watch out for
an accurate observation how did you recognise that
he was the most one in the group
you must play poker commander
poker is that a game of some sort
commander riker conducts masterclasses in poker
our skills are not dissimilar commander
mister mendoza if this lives up to its billing it will be a discovery of extraordinary value but it is a big if
a wormholes is there one moment and then gone the next a stable wormhole is unheard of
are you saying this may not be what it seems
the barzans do not have manned space travel so they had to resort to an automated probe its findings are limited it cannot be determined from these charts how stable the wormhole really is or how long it will remain intact
the federation could wind up buying a proverbial lemon
proverbial lemon
later data
and of course that means once the contract is negotiated and closed we would be obliged to fulfill the terms
we think we should take a look for ourselves
i dont think bhavani could object to that
geordi has continuous visual contact with the wormhole captain i think hes the logical choice
i would also like to volunteer sir
nobodys going in there until we have done a full sensor analysis i want to do everything possible to determine that its safe and when i am satisfied then you data and commander la forge will enter the wormhole tomorrow

just a moment of discomfort for a good cause daimon you understand this will not be lethal
doctor you surprise me i have no wish to kill anyone a short term crippling will suffice
then this will be just fine

a distillation of your own blood pyrocytes harmless to you undetectable by the ships biofilters but when absorbed through your victims skin it will provoke an extreme allergic reaction
id say it is time to extend the hand of the ferengi to the representative of the federation


much better
thank you come in for a drink
ah federation decor
not your style
well conformity is not my style
what would you like

id even like another there she is again counsellor troi
im not computer champagne
for two am i moving too fast for you
no im moving too fast for me
i like that better
i havent been able to stop thinking about you all day

you must have had a nice day
anticipation is fun  well be late for dinner
very late



mister mendoza
i seem to be a bit warm

i need some help here

you attempt to gain every unfair advantage picard
premier bhavani has no objection
well i most certainly do first you conveniently arrange to play host then you plan to send your own manned probe into the wormhole the federation thinks it can do anything it wants to well i will not tolerate it
i will gladly share the results of our exploration with all the delegates
and you expect us to believe what you report
then send in your own probe goss
thats exactly what i intend to do and i should strongly suggest you stay out of our way

tell data and la forge to do themselves a favour and stay out of their way

captain picard please come to sickbay
acknowledged doctor

whatever hes got is obviously not life threatening its some kind of systemwide histaminic reaction he certainly cant go back to negotiations for several days
will you keep me informed

the federations top negotiator taken out by a mysterious ailment suspicions
with the ferengi around always
youll have to fill in number one
me
well im the designated host it would be a most awkward transition youre the next likely choice and mister mendoza will certainly agree hes quite impressed by your natural instincts
excuse me sir but those werent natural instincts those were poker instincts a card game doesnt exactly prepare me for this
yes the stakes are higher but then isnt that when the game gets interesting commander

the wormhole will reappear in thirty seconds sir
the ferengi pod is moving into position
shuttle nine stand by

ferengi pod this is lieutenant commander la forge in the enterprise shuttle
this is doctor arridor go ahead
would you care to take the point doctor

we will gladly yield that honour to you lieutenant commander

you know if this doesnt work the thought of spending the rest of my life in here is none too appealing
there is a bright side geordi you will have me to talk to


it is visible captain
proceed when ready

 and intense energy fields which appear to be stabil
theyve travelled beyond our communication capabilities sir

a complete analysis of our bid is available on the ships computer for your consideration
commander i realise what a difficult position this must be for you if you dont understand something i hope you wont be too embarrassed to ask me
i think i have an idea what the rules are
well thats what makes it so interesting the rules of the game change to fit the moment
not unlike commanding a starship mister ral
well mister rikers placed a great deal of emphasis on defence a subject he obviously knows well having served starfleet in a number of conflicts now the chrysalians were enemies to no one and we choose to remain that way neutral
neutral and uninvolved sir in virtually all interstellar matters of consequence
no one would claim that the chrysalians are as powerful as the mighty federation but we have resources and technology and scientists too but we also have had peace for ten generations


you know i was thinking
mmm
maybe i could stretch out these negotiations for a few days would you like that
mmmhmmm  devinoni ral who are you
well what do your betazoid senses tell you about me
not much my human physical response must be blocking them out
good
it never happened to me before
i rather like it that im more difficult to read than your other men
there arent any others currently
what about commander riker
who have you been talking to
no one no one i just sensed something when i saw the two of you together
will riker and i are good friends
ah ha

it was once a little more than that
ah
how come were talking about me instead of you
dont you have enough people talk about their lives to you who counsels the counsellor
oh no i want to know about you
im what you see right now just me wanting to run away with you but knowing youd never leave this damned ship
when i first saw you i felt as if id been waiting for you im trying to understand why or how thats possible
does it matter well it will when i tell you but you must promise never to tell anyone else
what
i am part betazoid too my mother was one half i am one quarter
youre empathic
the only one of five children i must admit i was never as comfortable sensing emotions as you seem to be
thats why you left earth
yes i learned to live with it use it as you have but still it isolates us doesnt it and i thought it would always would so i tucked my heart away i didnt need it i didnt want it at the negotiating table it can be fatal to have a heart but i never realised how much i needed mine until i looked at you

im picking up an increase in accretion matter filtering in from the terminus

monitors are functioning normally again
ferengi pod everybody in one piece over there

our condition is no concern of yours enterprise shuttle we are competitors in this venture not partners

ferengi pod out
yeah happy landings to you too
curious we are not where we are supposed to be
what do you mean were on the other side of the wormhole arent we 
according to the barzan probe we should be in the gamma quadrant but these readings clearly indicate we are nearly two hundred light years away in sector three five five six of the delta quadrant
maybe the barzan readings were wrong
perhaps the readings were correct their probe could have exited the wormhole at a completely different location
data my visors picking up subatomic fluctuations meson and lepton activity is definitely increasing
gravitational acceleration is also increasing
something very strange is happening to this wormhole


sorry
youre unusually limber this morning
ill say devinoni ral its ridiculous and wonderful i feel completely out of control happy terrified but theres nothing rational about this
who needs rational when your toes curl up
im afraid im going to lose myself i cant get enough of him is it possible to fall in love in one day
i did
it was like this for you and jack
no it was another fellow i fell in love in a day it lasted a week but what a week then i met jack it took months to figure it out with him
well then maybe i should slow down catch my breath not let this get out of control
no


to be honest i was surprised to see the caldonians here at all leyor
you must think caldonia very insular mister ral
oh no no not at all not at all on the contrary ive respected your worlds commitment to pure research its just that well
go on please
well scholars dont always enjoy administrative demands and certainly weve seen here that the administration of the wormhole is
yes i must admit i have begun to feel some trepidation about that
yes yes im sure you have leyor im sure we all have do you realise that in the next century the number of ships that will pass

gentlemen this open session is called by request of the caldonian delegation
madame bhavani caldonia withdraws from these proceedings
for what reasons leyor
it has been made very clear that the maintenance and administrative requirements are beyond our abilities
leyor the federation would like to negotiate a trade agreement in which we could acquire your planets rich deposits of trillium  which we would add to our bid premier bhavani
my apologies we have already reached an agreement with the chrysalians

mister ral you either had very good instincts or foreknowledge of the caldonian withdrawal
some people just dont wish to transact business with the federation commander the chrysalians hereby add the caldonian trillium  to its bid premier

im telling you its changing

i can see it with my visor
i have no intention of leaving yet we have not finished taking our readings
listen doctor

your readings must be telling you the same things were getting this is not the gamma quadrant

i will not confirm your speculations

this is not a speculation doctor we are not where the barzans said we should be which would indicate

this side of the wormhole is not stable

there are meson and lepton fluctuations local gravitational fields are increasing exponentially everything says wed better get the hell out of here

it will be visible again in forty seconds we will make our own judgments then

i can see it now and im telling you that you dont have time to wait not even forty seconds
ferengi pod out
damn it arridor were seventy thousand light years away from our ships come on now follow us in well lead you

idiots its getting worse im taking us in data with or without them
thrusters at half power three quarters
entering outer event horizon

they panic quickly under pressure there precisely as scheduled right where i expected it to be



everyone was talking today about the way you absorbed the caldonian bid
well the opening was there i took it
commander riker didnt know how you managed it
let me tell you something about commander riker hes good hes the most dangerous man in the room to me
but he doesnt have an edge your edge
our edge you make it sound unethical
isnt it
deanna its just business
why havent you told anyone youre an empath
because i find it makes people uncomfortable
i think you dont tell them so you can gain an advantage
well i gained an advantage by using it with you you didnt seem to mind that look deanna the point of negotiating is to take advantage i dont know what the other side is offering and they dont know what im offering so we dance around each other until somebody wins i never cry foul when i lose
but youre reading their emotional states their inner selves and then using that to manipulate them
well people have been doing that for thousands of years just by listening carefully by watching body language i just happen to be better at it you do it
i do it to help my crew not outmanoeuvre them and i dont hide that im an empath
oh so you announce it to every alien culture you encounter or do you use it to give your side an advantage do you tell the romulan thats about to attack that you sense that he may be bluffing or do you just tell it to your captain
thats different thats a matter of protection
yes protection your protection your captain your crew your edge yes now its a matter of life and death when you take the advantage me i deal in property exchanges no body gets hurt so you tell me which one of us would you say has more of a problem with ethics excuse me

may i join you commander
bought out the ferengi yet ral
think i should give it a try
no but i think that you will one way or another its going to come down to you and me
you know youre very good at this very good much better than you realise
i hope im better than you realise
the last mile of the marathon is always the toughest thats when the winners are willing to take the big risks are you willing to do that
well see wont we
well lets see now im prepared to reach a firm agreement with bhavani before we learn the outcome of your probes expedition are you well well well that would not be looked upon favourably by the federation id imagine see you have to be willing to take that last step alone or it just isnt worth playing
your point of view not mine
oh i see that commander i see that otherwise you wouldnt be second in command of this starship you know i feel responsible for you in a way related deanna we both love deanna oh in different ways of course
i will remove the burden of that responsibility right now my relationship with deanna stands very well on its own without any help from you
of course it does of course it does its just that well shes an extraordinary woman brilliant lovely very passionate and she could have been yours will but you just didnt do enough to keep her and now well im here and im going to take her too
thats the first bad play ive seen you make if you can bring happiness into deannas life nothing would please me more you know youre really not such a bad sort ral except you dont have any values beyond the value of todays bid that is deanna is just the woman to bring some meaning to your sorry existence if youre smart enough to take it i doubt that you are to the last mile


sir the ferengi vessel is moving out of orbit impulse power they are approaching the entry to the wormhole sir
computer is the ferengi goss still on board the enterprise
daimon goss departed the enterprise at fourteen hundred hours
they are powering forward missile launchers sir
yellow alert hail the ferengi
request an explanation of your actions daimon goss
ive learned from informed sources that the federation has manipulated these negotiations from the very beginning and has already signed a secret agreement with the barzans
that is not true
the ferengi offer was never seriously considered
premier bhavani welcomed you to these proceedings despite my better judgment
 we will be ignored no longer
theyve fired a missile directly at the opening sir
destroy it
on screen firing phasers

your offers both have merit gentlemen if i could find a deciding factor

riker to picard whats happening captain

goss has fired a missile at the wormhole

i need you on the bridge number one
excuse me

excuse me for saying so under the circumstances premier but this fight is really between the federation and the ferengi now it seems unconscionable that your wormhole is being used as a pawn in their power struggle

you must know we will not allow you to do this
if the ferengi cannot have the wormhole no one will
a missile will have no destructive effect on a wormhole but if it should explode near the shuttlecraft they will be destroyed
casualties of war commander my men are prepared to die are yours
captain hes lying im almost sure of it he doesnt mean what he says
why what is he doing it for then
permission to enter the bridge captain
premier with all due respect
captain i believe i am in a better position to settle this with daimon goss than you are may i address him
premier
daimon goss this is devinoni ral
i have nothing to say to you ral
well then just listen the planet barzan has reached an agreement with the chrysalians for long term control of the wormhole now on behalf of the chrysalians i am prepared to offer the ferengi free access to the wormhole in perpetuity
i have your word on this
yes my word sir in exchange for ferengi convoy privileges to be negotiated in good faith
this is an acceptable offer
ferengi vessel has shut down its forward missile launcher
stand down red alert
commander riker im sorry you had to learn about my decision this way you represented the federation well but i have come to believe that the chrysalians tradition of peace is more desirable to my planet
excuse me premier theres something you should know im sorry was there something you wanted to say
no not at all
i sensed you suddenly felt uncomfortable
well after all it was a very tense situation
but thats whats so odd it wasnt tense at all in fact i sensed no tension from you or goss
but i was tense i was ready to blow it up i strongly protest
screen off
it was as though you were performing a scene for all of us
pardon me captain i believe theres a slight conflict of interest here
i agree entirely mister ral asked me not to tell anyone he has empathic powers which he uses to manipulate his competitors in a negotiation and yes it did put me in a conflict of interest which i hope i have now resolved premier i believe ral has used your fear of continuing aggression between the federation and its enemies to undermine our position i also believe that this incident was staged by ral and goss to provide you a reason to choose in favour of the chrysalians
captain its the shuttlecraft theyre coming back through
shuttle nine to enterprise
on screen
this is shuttle nine reporting in

barely
and the ferengi pod commander
trapped on the other side sir

in the delta quadrant we tried to warn them they wouldnt follow us
elaborate

captain this end of the wormhole is currently stable but the other end apparently shifts positions periodically

the barzan probe had no way to recognise this eventually both sides will be unstable
its a dry well captain worthless
acknowledged shuttle main shuttlebay prepare for final approach
aye sir
captain daimon goss is demanding to know where his men are
advise him to set his coordinates for the delta quadrant he may run into them in eighty years or so
mister ral congratulations on winning the rights to the barzan wormhole
i take the risks mister riker and i stand by my agreements

come in when do you leave
soon ive been recalled by the chrysalians explanations demanded and so forth
im sorry
ive done well for them over the years they understand the stakes itll be fine i had to do it troi bhavani was ready to go with the federation i sensed it id used up every card in the deck i needed to change the rules
you must have known i couldnt allow you to do that
my human physical response must have been blocking my betazoid senses im very grateful for what you did in a way its made me take a hard look at who i am i dont like what i see i once asked you to run away with me now im asking again i need you you could help me change you could be my conscience

i already have a job as counsellor
if you want to know what happens to arridor and kol in the delta quadrant
here is the tale

the vengeance factor



someone sure stripped this place
the reactors gone
no wonder they didnt answer our hail for two days nothing here to answer with
commander i am detecting life signs from behind that door
worf
commander take a look at this

blood
yes but not human im going to have to do some analysis on it
 its jammed


the two scientists are suffering from phaser stuns id guess several hits each
several
itll take us a while to bring them around but they will recover we found a sample of blood its a rare ironcopper composite unique to one humanoid species the acamarians
acamarians then that would suggest the gatherers
it is a likely hypothesis the nomadic marauders who refer to themselves as gatherers have raided other outposts in neighbouring sectors
theyve never come out this far before
mister crusher set course for the acamar system
aye sir
captains log stardate  in an effort to put an end to the gatherer raids we have come to the acamar system to enlist the aid of marouk the sovereign of acamar three


their raids have made this sector unsafe theyve ransacked our research facilities our trade routes have been disrupted
the gatherers are elusive weve only managed to capture a handful of them but with the starfleets help
hunting them down is not what i am proposing
reconciliation with the gatherers is impossible its been tried every time weve offered amnesty theyve rejected it
when was the last attempt made
eighteen years ago
eighteen years
for almost a century now theyve been parasites moving from star system to star system living on what they could find or steal
theyre still your people
no captain you have to understand our history a hundred years ago before the gatherers split off from our culture we were a savage violent race clans battled clans bloody vengeful feuds that lasted for generations but we overcame those ways all except for the gatherers
after a century of wandering they may be ready to come home
despite your progress you are a divided society and so it will remain until the gatherers return to acamar
the attempt may be futile
but there is so much to gain and there is so little to lose by the effort the problem affects us all it cannot be ignored

sovereign marouk welcome to the bridge
thank you captain
how soon will you be ready to leave acamar
i am ready now captain i need only bring aboard two more servants
ill see to that and to your accommodations
i have reason to believe there is a gatherer encampment somewhere in the hromi cluster
mister data
the federation has charted but not explored several class m planets in that area any one of these planets might well serve as a base
mister crusher set course for the hromi cluster
aye sir

a fine ship commander
were all very proud of her
yuta a light meal in twenty minutes
 may i be shown the kitchen commander
youre the chef
yes ill prepare all meals for the sovereign and her servants
we can provide you with a kitchen but it wont really be necessary these food dispensers can synthesise anything that you may been ill show you sovereign may i offer you a drink
yes thank you cold water
computer a glass of water five degrees
please

youre also the food taster
thats part of the cooks duty

im sure the sovereign will wish to sample many of the cuisines your ship has to offer but there are some acamarian dishes that she will insist upon
i will arrange for a technician to help programme your recipes into the computer of course ill have to try some of them whats your specialty
i have none
dont be modest you cant tell me you havent come up with a few culinary delights
there is a spiced parthas dish
parthas
a green vegetable with fleshy roots
parthas a la yuta i look forward to tasting it sovereign chef

now entering standard orbit of gamma hromi two sir
captain i am detecting life readings from the planet surface as well as several small areas of thermal radiation and carbon dioxide emissions indicative of combustion
campfires data
is that not what i said
its worth a look
make it so
data worf


artonian lasers tonkian homing beacons quite a collection
noranium alloy sir its salvage value is quite low
looks like these gatherers werent too discriminating in what they steal
commander ambush

rigelian phaser rifles sir not particularly powerful
powerful enough we came to talk
your words are wasted commander they understand only this 
were here to establish a dialogue worf
data tell me about noranium it vaporises at
two thousand three hundred fourteen degrees of course noranium carbide
thank you data
setting seven ought to do it
three two one now

enterprise four to beam up
cowards

your ambushes would be more successful if you bathed more often
weve brought the sovereign of acamar
marouk here
with an offer of amnesty

full dispensation will be extended to all gatherers who are willing to return to acamar three
you dont trust me marouk
should i

but you expect me to trust you maybe you just poisoned it yourself taste this temarek

barbarians this is futile
sovereign brull
go home old woman
you people havent changed in a hundred years
you should know you were there
sit down please please now were here to talk
its a waste of time captain they dont care about how they live
am i supposed to believe that you care how we live
yes
brull shes here isnt she
maybe you forced her to come picard
nobody forces me anywhere brull
what is there for us on acamar three
a life a home you can end your wanderings your miserable existence
do i look miserable to you
the clan wars are over brull it is a past were ashamed of it is why you had to leave now it is time to come home
i want to speak privately with sovereign marouk and picard everyone else get out

any insights
brulls ready to negotiate he just wants privacy so that he wont appear weak in front of the other gatherers
you are of the clan lornak
 what of it ive seen you before
yes
but its impossible
no look closer i am yuta of the clan tralesta

i am the last of my line but my clan will outlive yours

marouks offer has value
commander
but still i dont know
but youll agree it is enough to present to your leader
chorgan is a better judge of these matters i will take it to him you will hear from me in twenty days
brull in twenty days i hope to be very far away from here
with all due respect brull i would like to make the offer to chorgan myself
well gladly take you with us on the enterprise how many of your men do you want to accompany you
ill come alone if this is a trap
oh it isnt
mallon youll be in charge while im gone if im not back in ten days
brull brull

volnoth
away team to enterprise medical emergency
volnoth was an old man theres nothing to be done
theres a chance that our doctors can do something
you found him
yes and there are no other members of the lornak clan here so i claim his possessions
granted

have you no respect for the dead
whats there to respect about a corpse

temarek no calm down
hes been dead too long
how
cardiac arrest
you dont sound convinced
no he died of a heart attack all right but i cant find the cause his cardiac muscle is strong and theres no sign of arterial occlusion

brull will you show mister crusher the course to set to the hromi cluster
a child this doesnt inspire my confidence

this is our present position
set a heading for three four three mark seven two
thats going to take us through the centre of an asteroid belt
whats the matter kid cant you fly yourself around a couple of rocks
sure i can but if we take this heading we can avoid the belt completely and only lose twelve point one minutes at warp seven
have it your way kid

for centuries my planet was in chaos loyalty to ones clan was absolute the slightest injury to one member demanded violent retaliation
and these blood feuds could last for decades
the obsession with vengeance would be passed from generation to generation and with each act of retribution the violence would escalate
its not unlike much the history of my own planet

your pardon sovereign may i be excused briefly commander riker requested that i prepare him an acamarian dish
of course yuta

what are you doing
homework
what is this
math
i can see that but what does it mean
this is the locally euclidean metrisation of a kfold contravariant riemannian tensor field
you good at it you dont like me
i didnt say that
no problem i have many friends that dont like me but what do you know about me
youre a thief
i do it to survive not because i enjoy it we gatherers value our freedom we do as we want and we answer to no creature
then why are you helping sovereign marouk to change all that
maybe because i want something better for me and for my children
you have children
yeah two sons ones just about your age hes not any good at math

parthas a la yuta
with the help of one of your food stations
its wonderful
truly excellent
thank you
would you care to join us
i dont want to intrude
youre not i was just leaving please sit down

it really is delicious
im glad it pleases you commander
im not your commander my name is william
i will call you william if you prefer
i do when you say commander you say it like you say sovereign to marouk
as a servant youre an excellent commander but youd make a poor sovereign
whys that not that i disagree
youre not comfortable with servants
no i prefer the company of equals
so you treat me as an equal
and youre not comfortable with that
im not used to it ive always been a servant not that im complaining the sovereign treats me well i have all that i could want
what about freedom
i can never have that
because youre the property of the sovereign
no im not her slave i can leave whenever i wish
but you have no place to go
just the opposite my path is all too clear
yuta youre an excellent chef but you speak in riddles
ive never been very good at conversation
yuta
i believe the sovereign wants me to return enjoy the parthas
sickbay to commander riker ive discovered something interesting will
on my way

youre scowling doctor
im thinking
and
the old gatherer on the planet i know what caused his heart attack the medical tricorder almost missed it but there was a microvirus in his body blocking his autonomic nerve impulses
and that stopped his heart
but heres the really interesting part this microvirus will only attach itself to cells which contain a very specific dna sequence
how specific
without knowing more about their genetic makeup i cant be sure but my guess is this virus would only kill one acamarian in a million
pretty singleminded bug
too singleminded i cant believe its a naturally occurring virus
meaning somebody engineered it
meaning volnoth was murdered

sir acamar three has agreed to your request for access to their databases they are now being transmitted into our computer over subspace link
good notify doctor crusher when acamars medical database is online riker out come in
im disturbing you
not at all
as the sovereign has no further need for my services this evening she suggested i might spend some time with you
what a charming suggestion
she appreciates the affection youve shown me
was i that obvious
yes
well ive already dined maybe you know a good acamarian dessert recipe

does that not please you tell me what you want william i will do anything you wish
wait a minute
i dont understand dont you want me to give you pleasure
not as a servant i told you i prefer equals
even in the matters of love
especially in matters of love
ive offended you
no i only want to make you as happy as you want to make me youre entitled to that
no im not
yuta
i do not feel pleasure or passion i havent been able to for a long time
i dont know who did this to you or why but it can change
i wish it could tonight most of all im sorry


your people prepare a warm welcome
thats chorgans ship
shields holding
mister worf contact chorgan tell him brull has brought us to talk
chorgan is not responding
mister worf can we knock out their shields without seriously damaging their ship
i believe we can sir
prepare phasers and open a channel
phasers locked channel open
chorgan this is captain jeanluc picard of the enterprise all right lets focus their attention mister worf fire phasers
their forward shields are inoperative
well done lieutenant
we are being hailed sir
thats better on screen
brull you traitor you have led them here to destroy me
chorgan if i had wanted you destroyed you would not be talking to me now obviously i wanted something else
and what is that
i have on board sovereign marouk of acamar three i want you to hear what she and brull have to say
shes worth listening to
i dont wish to listen to either of you
you have no choice prepare to receive us were beaming on board picard out cancel red alert tell sovereign marouk meet me in transporter three
aye sir
youre going alone captain
the danger is minimal number one chorgan is unlikely to do anything rash with the enterprises phasers trained on his ship
there are still risks
for these negotiations to succeed i must be a mediator not an enforcer you have the bridge number one brull

chorgan this is sovereign marouk
you may sit
chorgan i think you will find marouks proposal
you know picard i could take you prisoner oh dont worry ive no intention of doing so i know what trouble its been for you to get here and i am curious why
then lets proceed
quite simply i am proposing amnesty for every gatherer
amnesty you mean slavery
chorgan if you want to know what i think
i dont say what you came to say though i doubt that im going to believe you
i didnt believe this very persuasive federation captain when he suggested that we could reconcile our differences im convinced now its the right thing not just for you but for us too we need you back ive brought some acamarian brandy im sure its been a long time

no you have spent a century hunting us down
she is trying to put an end to all that
yes by luring us back and putting us in prison
no by accepting you back as free men
will you feed and clothe us too
no of course i wont what i will do is give you the means to feed and clothe yourselves weve set aside some land and you can use it to
land do we look like farmers to you
then dont farm use the land as you wish it is yours and the moment you set foot on it youll be better off than you are today you wont be running any longer
we will need autonomy
autonomy
sovereign we can at least acknowledge that chorgan appears willing to discuss your offer
there are many levels of autonomy certainly your region would have certain rights
yes and those rights will be spelled out before i agree to anything

commander im afraid the only entry we have on volnoth in the acamarian database is a birth record
probably one of the last of the gatherers to be born on their planet
commander ive been digging through the medical database from acamar three for hours and i have found another victim of the same microvirus that killed volnoth but only one fifty three years ago a gatherer named penthormul
data anything in your file on penthormul
yes sir he was a member of the lornak clan he was captured while leading a gatherer raid on an acamarian outpost he died of a heart attack before his trial ended
display volnoths birth record again
lornak the same clan
the only two recorded deaths by this microvirus both from the same clan what does that tell us doctor
if these microbes were engineered for murder id say somebody could be going after a whole family
commander chorgan the present leader of the gatherers is also from the lornak clan
i want to know just how this clan was involved in the acamarian blood feuds and id like to know any clue as to who their enemies were how could this virus have been transmitted doctor
more ways than i can count and its perfectly safe to the carrier as long as he doesnt have the same dna patterns
tailor made for their enemies
commander eighty years ago the lornaks massacred a rival clan the tralestas it ended a feud that had lasted for two hundred years
ended it
according to these records there were no survivors the tralestas were annihilated
something tells me they werent all been wiped out
there must be a missing link here
computer any members of the acamarian delegation from the tralesta clan
clan affiliation is not within provided records
sir i believe i have found a correlation between the two deaths your missing link that is penthormul being led from his trial

i dont see the connection
behind him and to the left sir
computer scan left and magnify
the computer can extrapolate and reconstruct the rest of the face sir
do it

but that photograph was taken over fifty years ago
fifty three years ago and she hasnt aged a day

three seats on the ruling council
if were going to be subject to your laws we want a part in making it
well i agree youre entitled to representation but not on the ruling council
unacceptable the real power is in the council youre shutting us off already
no youre trying to take too much no group has three seats on the council
i dont care what others have
you only care about what you can take
sovereign if the situation were reversed im sure you would be demanding equal levels of representation
youre right captain i apologise for my temper
perhaps a brief pause would be helpful
i agree maybe a little touch of that brandy
yuta
you know thank you it is remarkable how very much alike the two of you actually are
thats ridiculous
really captain
no im quite serious you are both able negotiators strong leaders
we dont obey weak leaders
we have nothing in common at all we havent agreed to anything
youre wrong chorgan weve agreed to have some brandy together

dont move
a federation trap
chorgan i assure you my first officer has a good reason for his actions you do number one
yuta move away from chorgan do it
why
because of a man you once knew named pentharmul
pentharmul how do you know pentharmul
tell him yuta
i dont understand
you were with pentharmul when he died
it was fifty years ago how could i
i know yuta stop chorgan keep perfectly still your life is in danger step back yuta
william this is not your concern
it is now youre about to commit a murder
it isnt murder its justice
who are you
yuta of the clan tralesta
there are no more tralestas
five survived the last lornak raid but on that day a century ago my life ended and my search began i was the one chosen transformed my cells were altered my aging slowed enough to finish my task
you used me in order to get to the last few you couldnt reach
yes sovereign
you will never leave this ship alive
youre the last once youre dead what happens to me doesnt matter
the wars are over yuta
you cannot understand
youre right i cant because ive seen the part of you that regrets what youve become listen to me you dont have to do this any more
i have no choice
you do
william i im sorry
stop

yuta dont do this

commander i am in your debt


oh yes thank you new orders from starfleet the rendezvous  nothing thank you the rendezvous with the goddard has been postponed
in the meantime
starbase three four three were to take on medical supplies for the alpha leonis system
sounds pretty routine
with the gatherer truce in effect it certainly should be we wont require a full ships complement im going to extend shore leave on the starbase to anyone who wants it
ill pass that along to the crew captain
the defector



the life of henry v by william shakespeare
 act iv scene  but with alexander court missing along with some dialogue
 brother john bates is not that the morning which breaks yonder
i think it be but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day
whos there
 a friend
under what captain serve you
under sir thomas erpingham
i pray you what thinks he of our estate
even as men wrecked upon a sand that look to be washed off the next tide
he hath not told his thought to the king
no nor it is not meet he should for though i speak it to you i think the king is but a man as i am the violet smells to him as it doth to me in his nakedness he appears but a man therefore his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his army
he may show what outward courage he will but i believe as cold a night as tis he could wish himself in thames up to the neck
methinks i could not die anyplace so contented as in the kings company his cause being just and his quarrel honourable
thats more than we know
or more than we should seek after if his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us
but if the cause be not good the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in a battle shall join together at the latter day and cry all we died at such a place
the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant
splendid data splendid youre getting better and better
freeze programme thank you sir i plan to study the performances of olivier branagh shapiro kullnark
data youre here to learn about the human condition and there is no better way of doing that than by embracing shakespeare but you must discover it through your own performance not by imitating others
riker to picard sorry to interrupt sir
go ahead number one
sensors are picking up an

unidentified craft in the neutral zone

its heading toward federation space
on our way picard out well get to the rest of the act another time data computer file programme and clear
captain why should a king wish to pass as a commoner if he is the leader should he not be leading

listen to what shakespeare is telling you about the man data a king who had a true feeling for his soldiers would wish to share their fears with them on the eve of battle
sir will i be able to schedule a performance for the crew in the near future
lets not rush it shall we

outpost sierra six confirms our readings sir they identify it as a romulan scout ship bearing two seven zero mark one four
a scout ship what would a scout ship be doing this far into the neutral zone
captain shall we transmit a warning to withdraw sir
open a hailing frequency
aye sir captain the romulan is hailing us
picard visual
not within range yet
open a channel
federation ship do you read i require urgent assistance
this is captain jeanluc picard of the uss
federation ship please help me requesting asylum under pursuit
pursuit
visual range on screen captain

red alert open a channel to the warship
come to intercept course keep us out of the neutral zone
channel is open
how long before they cross over into federation territory
fortyone seconds sir
romulan warbird this is captain jeanluc picard of the federation vessel enterprise you have crossed into the neutral zone and are engaged in hostile action explain yourself and your intent
no reply sir
hail the scout
responding
on screen
federation craft please you must help me
we are moving to intercept maintain your course and power

scout ship is severely damaged captain engines inoperative shields are down
position
coordinates one four zero by two zero five sir
federation space
right move to within five kilometres mister la forge prepare to extend

our shields around the romulan scout ship
at that range the shields wont be able to take much punishment captain

five kilometres sir
all stop
extend shields
shields in place

weve got the scout ship captain

weapons on the warbird are fully powered sir
lock phasers open a channel
ready
romulan vessel you are now in federation territory unless you withdraw

no argument
warbird has reentered the neutral zone heading for romulan territory
massive power failure to the scout ship sir all systems are going offline including life support
transporter two prepare to beam the occupant of the scout ship directly aboard
aye sir
mister worf
mister data lock onto the scout ship take it in tow

energise
i must see your captain immediately
well take you to sickbay after that
this cannot wait i have information vital to your survival
captains log stardate  we have beamed aboard an apparent romulan defector who claims to be a low ranking logistics officer with extraordinary information about a secret offensive

the humiliating defeat at the battle of cheron has not been forgotten the new leaders have vowed to discard the treaty and claim the neutral zone nelvana three is just the first step
youre saying an entire base has already been established there
in fortyeight hours the reactor core will be online
so the federation sensors that monitor the neutral zone just missed it
it would seem so in two days a fleet of romulan warbirds will be within striking distance of fifteen federation sectors
the federation will not permit that
then it is war that were talking about isnt it destroy the base now and the threat is over
well im sure you are fatigued by your ordeal and you require medical attention lieutenant worf will you accompany sublieutenant setal to the sickbay we will attend to your quarters
no doubt you will wish to question me further
no doubt

he tells a hell of a story
you dont believe it
the empire knows that wed never allow them to maintain a base within the neutral zone
commander that would not be an atypical romulan ploy in their long history of war the romulans have rarely attacked first they prefer to test their enemys resolve
i think hes a plant to draw us into the neutral zone then well look like the aggressors
and the romulans would have a legitimate excuse for responding in force
exactly
that would also not be an atypical romulan ploy sir
its always a chess game with them isnt it
well at least hes given us the chance to get a look at some romulan technology close up
mister la forge you will lead the away team over to the scout commander you and counsellor troi will conduct setals interrogation
captain permission to observe the interrogation
no mister data i need you on the bridge with me there is much to be done we have less than forty eight hours to prevent a war or perhaps to start one this will depend on establishing the truth of



i set the autodestruct sequencer before i left the ship
why
wouldnt you to prevent your ship from being captured
excuse me for being a little confused setal but i thought you were defecting
i am not a traitor all you can see is the opportunity to exploit me the federation credo exploitation you couldnt get aboard my ship fast enough strip it down what secrets might it reveal that we can use youre a short sighted people cant you understand i came to stop a war
if you could just hold still with your metabolism this will heal in a few moments
thank you doctor how fortunate you know something of romulan medicine
yes i had a chance to gain some experience recently
ah yes the incident at galorndon core the two officers
you are aware of a great deal for a logistics clerk
it was common knowledge i can show you my rating code
forged credentials are a simple matter for a spy
how do you allow klingon pahtk to walk around in a starfleet uniform
you are lucky this is not a klingon ship we know how to deal with spies
remove this tohzah from my sight
your knowledge of klingon curses is impressive but as a romulan might say only a veruul would use such language in public mister worf please see to the security arrangements for our guests stay
aye sir

you find something amusing
lieutenant worf i like him to be more accurate i understand him a warrior proud fearless living only for combat exactly the type that will get us all killed if were not careful

this is the food station you can reach me through the comm panel later wed like to ask you a few more questions

computer water
temperature
twelve onkians
this system is calibrated to the celsius metric system
any temperature at all on the cold side of whatever your system is


there is no unusual activity in the nelvana system sir
lets isolate and magnify that system
nothing on the sensors
it is hard to believe in what one cannot see and yet conceivably with their cloaking technology a fleet of romulan warships could be passing before our eyes there must be some way to neutralise this advantage
captain picard priority one message from starfleet coming in on secured channel
in my ready room computer delay time
two hours twenty two minute delay from time of transmission

at starfleet command on lya three
computer key access four one two mark eight zero picard jeanluc starfleet priority code gamma decode begin message
captain we have received an official protest from the romulan empire demanding the return of your defector obviously we are refusing to comply i join in your scepticism but if it is a deception the romulans are certainly making a good show of it the federation council has convened in emergency session there is no doubt in my mind that this will eventually fall on your shoulders jeanluc youve got him you must decide if hes telling the truth for now i suggest you proceed along the neutral zone border toward a federation position proximate to nelvana three
picard to lieutenant worf
yes captain
please come to my ready room
aye sir on my way

slow playback display engine logs and power data of both vessels now watch what happens at zero nine five four three three on the clock the scout has sustained engine damage forcing him to slow to point six one five impulse power the warship should overtake him but it doesnt now just two point six seconds later the warbird slows to precisely the same speed three times three speed fluctuations the warship kept its distance every time i dont think they wanted to catch up
and yet they fired at the scout ship they could have killed him
not necessarily doctor the romulans have the same capability to direct the impact of their weapons as we do
is there a possibility the wound could be selfinflicted
theyre very bad burns i hardly think
a possibility

captains log stardate  were holding a position at the neutral zone border proximate to nelvana three if our guest is telling the truth there are twenty one hours left before the romulan base becomes functional

the monitor and the hood are headed in your direction though they will arrive too late to be of assistance warnings have gone out to all outposts along the border as well as several independent vessels in nearby sectors no one here wants a war captain but we are prepared to take them on if thats what they want all federation starships have been placed on yellow alert
come
you wanted to see me captain
yes data i want you to prepare a class one probe set the sensors for maximum scan i want every metre of nelvana three monitored
i will start my calibrations sir
data
is there something else you require of me captain
your clarity of thought your objectivity as always sit down data its very possible we are about to go to war the repercussions of what we do during the next twenty four hours may be felt for years to come i want you to keep a record of these events so that history will have the benefit of a dispassionate view
i will begin immediately sir is that all
how is the crews spirit
they are concerned of course captain but confident do you not see that sir
data unlike king henry it is not easy for me to disguise myself and walk among my troops thatll be all

now if these men do not die well it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it

why must we waste time playing this ridiculous game
theres more here than youre telling us youre forcing yourself to hold back
i have told you everything relevant about nelvana three
im not talking about the base
the base is all that matters
youre lying setal
go to nelvana three and you will see
were not going anywhere until we get to the truth youre a spy arent you
no
then prove it you can begin by telling me something about the location and strength of the romulan fleet
i dont know it
youre a logistics officer
for one sector only
whos your superior officer
admiral jarok
the location of the romulan bases along the neutral zone
i dont know
in your sector
irrelevant
the number of troops under your admirals command
irrelevant irrelevant
i guess youre right its not worth playing this game
what a fool ive been to come looking for courage in a lair of cowards

captain picard priority message from security officer klingon vessel bortas
lieutenant worf will you handle this at security station deck nine
aye sir

sensors are configured for planetary probe sir ready for launch
proceed
probe on course sensors are functioning
coordinate your analysis with mister la forge i want this report with dispatch

i dont know data my gut tells me we ought to be listening to what this guys trying to tell us
your gut
its just a feeling you know an instinct intuition
but those qualities would interfere with rational judgment would they not
youre right sometimes they do
then why not rely strictly on the facts
because you just cant rely on the plain and simple facts sometimes they lie
they can lead to wrong conclusions but they cannot lie
what do you think is he a defector or not
the facts to date would lead to an objective conclusion that he is not
somehow i think were going to catch the romulans with their pants down on nelvana three just like he says
with their pants
a metaphor catching them in the act
because your gut tells you so
exactly but you cant always go with your gut either its a combination data right ill put it to you this way all these feelings that get in the way of human judgment that confuse the hell out of us that make us second guess ourselves well we need them we need them to help us fill in the missing pieces because we almost never have all the facts
so a person fills in missing pieces of the puzzle with his own personality resulting in a conclusion based as much on instinct and intuition as on fact
now youre getting it
but what does one do if he has no instinct and intuition
data look at this the facts just took a left turn

as the probe went into orbit around nelvana three it began picking up low level subspace radio emissions
could they be naturally occurring
no sir the patterns are clearly artificial
the signal was so faint our ship sensors couldnt read it from this distance
can we decode it
weve tried its probably romulan but we cant be sure weve also picked up ionisation disturbances
cloaked romulan ships could produce that effect
what about the planet surface
reading nothing but barren rock i dont know they might be able to hide a base from our probe its capabilities are limited the only way well know for sure is if we go and take a look for ourselves
thatll be all gentlemen


i take it you have never seen a romulan before
that would be an incorrect assumption
then why do you invade my privacy
i was attempting to ascertain what my guts tell me about you
youre the android i know a host of romulan cyberneticists that would love to be this close to you
i do not find that concept particularly appealing
nor should you
i am told by various crewmembers that this viewport is their favourite on the ship
i thought it would bring me some comfort but these are not my stars even the heavens are denied to me here synthetic swill i dont suppose your food terminals would be capable of producing a romulan ale
i am afraid they would require the molecular structure of the beverage in question and as you are no doubt aware our knowledge of your planet is quite limited
the loss is yours for i have visited over a hundred different worlds and none possessed the awesome beauty of romulus
am i correct in assuming you regret your decision to come here
what i did had to be done but to never again see the firefalls of gath galthong and the spires of my home as they rise above the apnex sea at dawn its a bitter thing to be exiled from your home
it does appear unlikely you will ever be allowed to return to your planet
the cold reaction of an android
but perhaps we can bring romulus to you

programme complete
run programme

after you


the valley of chula i know it well
you are free to stay here as long as you wish
i no longer live here turn it off
cancel programme
this this is my home now my future i have sacrificed everything it must not be in vain arrange a meeting between myself and captain picard tell him admiral jarok wants to see him

captain we have confirmed that you are holding admiral alidar jarok he has been identified as the commander at the massacre at the norkan outposts the council strongly advises that you to consider jarok an unreliable source of information
bring him in

ensign will you wait outside have a seat admiral jarok
captain there is no more time
admiral have a seat you see im just not convinced that you are telling the truth
what must i do
you must convince me if i had irrefutable evidence but you did not bring irrefutable evidence you brought no evidence at all now here you are not the man you claimed to be admiral your credibility is stretched beyond belief a romulan defector is almost a contradiction in terms but admiral jarok crossing the lines
i explained my motives to your interrogators
yes yes yes yes yes peace in our galaxy except admiral you are not a man of peace your military record what we know of it is clear
which is precisely why i chose an alternate identity here
the massacres in the norkan outposts for example
what you call massacres were called the norkan campaign on my world captain one worlds butcher is another worlds hero perhaps i am neither one
on what basis admiral am i to decide your good word are you willing to help us overpower the romulan btype warbirds we may encounter are you prepared to help us detect them through their cloaking shields you see my problem admiral you ask us for faith in circumstances which are hardly possible to believe compounded by lies and your refusal to tell us all you know
i cannot betray my people
youve already betrayed your people admiral youve made your choices sir youre a traitor now if the bitter taste of that is unpalatable to you i am truly sorry but i will not risk the lives of my crew because you think you can dance on the edge of the neutral zone youve crossed over admiral you make yourself comfortable with that
do you have any children captain picard a family
no
then you have sacrificed too much for your career
yes this is all very interesting
there comes a time in a mans life that you cannot know when he looks down at the first smile of his baby girl and realises he must change the world for her for all children it is for her that i am here not to destroy the romulan empire but to save it for months i tried desperately to persuade the high command that another war would destroy the empire they got tired of my arguments finally i was censured sent off to command some distant sector this was my only recourse i will never see my child smile again she will grow up believing that her father is a traitor but she will grow up if you act picard if we stop the war before it begins
i cant and i wont unless i have unequivocal cooperation

admiral jarok has provided me with the locations strengths and tactical plans of the romulan fleet mister la forge he is prepared to give you data regarding engines weapons and the cloaking systems of the warbird class starship but i believe his experience as a field commander will be more valuable for its strategic sense than in the technical areas
any edgell help captain
dont depend on it for all we know he may still be lying but we shall find that out soon enough number one set course for nelvana three
second officers log stardate  we have entered the neutral zone in direct violation of the treaty of algeron presuming romulan warships are cloaked and monitoring us we expect heavy resistance as we approach nelvana three

tactical
nothing on sensors
i dont like it i wouldve expected a greeting party
you echo another noteworthy commander in a similar circumstances number one a countryman of yours george armstrong custer when his seventh cavalry arrived at the little big horn
may we have better luck
approaching nelvana system
engage impulse engines
nelvana three on screen still no sign of them on sensors in a way id rather be fighting my way this its just too damned easy
prepare to enter standard orbit data
scanning the planet sir no life forms no power sources no weapons systems
no indication of a base at all
no sir
the subspace signal the probe detected the ionisation disturbances
i am picking them up sir but i cannot identify the source they seem to be moving in an orbital path with an eight hundred kilometre apogee
lieutenant worf bring the admiral up here
aye sir
maybe they abandoned the planet after he defected
there is no scarring on the planet surface that would denote heavy construction of any kind
a cloaking device of some sort to hide the entire base
a cloaking device operating on the surface would be given away by visible distortion effects

perhaps youd care to explain why were here admiral
there doesnt appear to be a base
i dont understand
nelvana three admiral no base no weapons no sign of any life at all
but i saw the tactical communiqus the records timetables for completion an entire legion was assigned to the section
is it possible they could have been feeding you disinformation you said that you had been censured reassigned four months ago they knew of your dissatisfaction could all this have been to test your loyalty
no no its impossible
they let you escape with an arsenal of worthless secrets what other explanation is there
permission to withdraw from the neutral zone
at your earliest convenience number one
helm bring her round one hundred and eighty degrees geordi get us out of here
i hear you commander
two romulan warships uncloaking coordinates

shields holding
damage
minor damage in the secondary hull

power transfer fields may be pinched off

im working on it
captain
not yet mister worf this is just a tap on the shoulder or we wouldnt be here talking about it
the romulans are hailing us
on screen
captain picard i hardly expected to see you again so soon it seems this time you are the one who has made an aggressive move across the neutral zone
commander tomalak as im sure you already know we were responding to a warnings of romulan incursions at nelvana three
but captain as you can see there is no incursion
and the matter of the unidentified subspace radio emissions and the ionisation disturbances
ah you must mean our orbiting probe we are studying nelvana three for archaeological research
with a cloaked satellite
really captain would you have us believe this satellite is an excuse for your aggressive charge across the neutral zone
you can believe what you wish we will be on our way
without even an apology captain
if an apology will do then i offer it
im afraid it wont so i will save you the humiliation
get to it tomalak
you see picard after we dissect your enterprise for every precious bit of information i intend to display its broken hull in the centre of the romulan capitol as a symbol of our victory it will inspire our armies for generations to come and serve as a warning to any other traitor who would create ripples of disloyalty
all the communiqus all the timetables all the records they were all fiction written for my benefit a test a test of my loyalty and you used me to lure the enterprise into the neutral zone
first captain you will return the traitor jarok then you will surrender as prisoners of war
do you seriously expect me to accept those terms
no captain picard i expect you wont you have thirty seconds to decide
i do not require one tomalak
i urge you captain picard surrender consider the men and women you would lead into a lost cause
if the cause is just and honourable they are prepared to give their lives are you prepared to die today tomalak
i expected more from you than an idle threat picard
then you shall have it mister worf
aye sir

klingon warships armed and ready sir
what shall it be tomalak
you will still not survive our assault
you will not survive ours shall we die together
i look forward to our next meeting captain
romulan disruptors powering down sir

cancel red alert mister worf will you extend the appreciation of the federation and my personal gratitude to the klingons
aye sir
take us back number one
i did it for nothing my home my family for nothing

he ingested a felodesine chip he must have brought it with him im sorry captain there was no antidote
a letter to his wife and daughter
sir he must have known it would be impossible for us to deliver this
today perhaps but if there are others with the courage of admiral jarok we may hope to see a day of peace when we can take his letter home
the hunted

captains log stardate  we have arrived at angosia three a planet that has expressed a strong desire for membership in the federation prime minister nayrok has taken commander riker and me on a tour of the capital city

well im greatly impressed with everything ive seen so far prime minister

then i hope it will reflect favourably in your report captain
its a tribute to your people that you were able to recover so rapidly from the tarsian war
it is indeed we are not warriors we believe reason can settle disputes but not every culture agrees with our position
an unfortunate reality
the development of the mind the cultivation of the intellect these are the pursuits to which the angosians have dedicated themselves for centuries
prime minister im sorry to interrupt but we have a problem may i see you for a moment
excuse me gentlemen  yes what is it
well i think theyll make a fine addition to the federation number one
im not sure id like to live in this place a little stuffy for my taste
a prisoner has escaped from the penal colony on lunar five two guards are dead the prisoner has taken a transport vessel
do you have means of pursuit
the tracking station was sabotaged the entire base is in chaos we have ordered ships from the surface to follow him but to be honest our civilian pilots are not trained for this
with your permission mister data a stolen transport vessel has departed from lunar five

have you picked it up on the sensors
yes commander
good

detain the vessel and quarantine the pilot is he armed
yes and extremely dangerous commander lunar five is a maximum security facility
did you read that data
yes sir

we will use extreme caution
keep us informed riker out
on screen sir
specifications on the vessel mister worf
no warp drive minimal weaponry
heading mister crusher
three one nine mark two five oh sir
vessels speed increasing to point oh two impulse hes seen us data

thats the ships drive section
what happened to the rest of the ship
scan the drive section for life form readings
none
bring us around to the back side of the asteroid mister crusher
sensors indicate wreckage on the asteroids surface data
no life signs
apparently he did not survive
data the drive section whered it go theres no sign of it on its previous heading someone must be at the helm
status report mister data
i am afraid the prisoner has eluded us sir

eluded the enterprise

we followed procedures precisely captain scanners indicated no life forms present in the drive section i cannot explain how he escaped
incoming message from the angosian prime minister
on screen
captain weve identified the prisoner his name is roga danar his criminal record is too long to go into but i must caution you that he is given to bouts of uncontrollable violence
i appreciate your warning prime minister we will keep you informed of our progress

geordi how far and how fast can that transport ship travel
without warp drive theres no way he could be out of our range by now
weve been sweeping the area constantly commander theres nothing within sensor range
a cloaking device
sir the angosians have no cloaking technology
unless hes borrowing one if hes hanging over the planets pole the magnetic field would confuse our sensors
commander i believe i can recalibrate our sensors to read through the electromagnetic interference over the poles
lets try it mister crusher realign for polar orbit
aye sir
there he is commander you were correct
this guy knows all the tricks doesnt he
there are still no life form readings coming from the vessel
could it be the magnetic interference data
i have compensated still no readings
well have an answer shortly lock on tractor beam mister la forge
tractor beam locking on sir
he is coming about sir
hes out of his mind
sensors detect a massive power build up in his aft thrusters
on main viewer
hes making a suicide run
shields have been automatically activated tractor beam disengaged
he bounced off the shields
thats an interesting twist
mister crusher fix coordinates onto that vessel well just beam the whole thing to a shuttlebay if we have to
i do not believe that will be necessary captain he is no longer in the drive section
what
i anticipated that diversionary tactic based on his pattern to date we are picking up a cylindrical object approximately seven metres in length and three metres in diameter
on screen
magnify
an escape pod
this guys incredible
yet there are still no life form readings
transporter room four prepare to beam aboard from inside that shuttle anything large enough to be a humanoid adult
aye sir
security team report to transporter room four
on our way sir

were holding the contents in stasis pending arrival of security an illicit weapon has been detected in the transport beam sir

its been rendered inoperable
work lets greet our guest

bring him in mister obrien

just stay where you are

more security transporter room four more security more security



get him to a detention cell set phasers on maximum stun
commander

well need a few hours to get the containment field on lunar five operational before we pick him up the damage he did during his escape was considerable
we will await your signal
i appreciate your patience the prison psychologist recommends that you keep danar fully sedated until hes ready for transport
well hes in our highest security detention area there shouldnt be any more problems
do not relax your security for an instant captain he is extremely violent and very cunning as you already know i will send a transport vessel to pick him up as soon as possible nayrok out
have you run a diagnostic on the sensors data
yes sir there is nothing wrong with the ships sensors the reason we did not sense life signs aboard the escape vessel is because the prisoner has no life signs
computer identify the occupant of the detention cell
the detention cell is vacant at this time
hes in there
could he be some kind of android
our sensors can identify artificial lifeforms sir apparently he is capable of deceiving the sensors


are you all right
what is this ship
youre on board the uss enterprise
a war vessel
a federation starship
federation
we were orbiting angosia when you escaped from lunar five
it seems that i am a victim of my own bad timing and you are the keeper of this jail

im deanna troi ships counsellor
counsellor too bad id rather you were a jailer to keep me company during my return trip i assume we are returning to lunar five
that terrifies you
i just killed three men to get out of there counsellor and im fully capable of killing you as well thats terrifying thought isnt it even to me
do they mistreat you there
not at all i am comfortable well fed and housed oh no the angosians take good care of their prisoners its simply a matter of never being able to leave what about you counsellor do you always visit the prisoners are you a specialist in criminal behaviour or am i just an interesting specimen that landed on your ship like an insect to be studied under your microscope
why do you have all this anger toward me
a girl with long dark hair broke my heart a long time ago out of bitterness and resentment i turned to crime how about this one my mother abandoned me when i was a little boy i never got the guidance that a wild young man needed
why are you doing this
playing games isnt that what you do counsellor isnt that what all of you mind control experts do
i am not a mind control expert i came here because i sensed you were in pain
and what do you sense now
the pain is gone
its interesting isnt it

theres a duality in the man its hard to describe hes aware of his crimes in fact they trouble him deeply
counsellor
hes intelligent thoughtful typically angosian i know what hes done but when im with him i cannot believe he is randomly and deliberately violent in fact inherently he has a nonviolent personality
counsellor it took five men to restrain him and he took apart half of the transporter room in the process
im not opening the door for him captain i can only tell you that i sense something very unusual about him something that is not inherent to a criminal personality
in a few hours ill be turning him over to the angosians and ill be happy to do it
i understand

data do we have a link up to the angosian central computer
yes counsellor we are copying records for federation inspection pursuant to their application for admittance
can i see a police record on roga danar

there is no police record
thats impossible hes been in prison
lunar five is a military prison facility
military hes a soldier 
that may provide an explanation for the tactics he was able to use against us when we tried to capture him
it doesnt say here what he was arrested for call up his military record
he served in many campaigns during the tarsian war received two promotions to the rank of subhadar a very honourable tour of duty
what was this mans crime

ive learned you are a soldier
i was a soldier
why were you put in prison
obviously because i am a threat to society
theres no police record what did you do
everything they asked me to do thats why i became such a threat
i dont understand
why are you bothering to try counsellor
because i want to help if i can
unlock the door
you are a nonviolent man yet you committed acts of excessive violence
you can learn to do it if you have to
did you have to
it was war
so it started with the war
it started the day i volunteered counsellor the day i began training the day i met my first instructor and he also called himself a counsellor

roga danar was an idealistic young man who answered his peoples call to service he joined the military to fight for the angosian way of life what he didnt realise was that by doing so he would have to give up that way of life for ever hes not the same man who left home to go to war hes been through intense psychological manipulation and biochemical modifications
at trois request i examined him his cell structure has been significantly altered they used a combination of cryptobiolin triclenidil macrospentol and a few things i cant even recognise
was he a prisoner of war who did this to him
his own government hes been programmed to be the perfect soldier he can be absolutely normal but when a danger is perceived the programming clicks in and takes over memory strength intelligence reflexes all become enhanced hes conditioned to survive at any cost
one of the new substances in his cellular structure even shields electrical impulses
perhaps that would explain why our sensors did not detect him
why was he assigned to the lunar five facility
he committed no crime he says he was ordered there with others like him when the first soldiers returned to angosia they had trouble the rules changed too quickly a lost temper could result in murder
counsellor did no one try to adjust their programming
they were just exiled to lunar five
lunar five an orbiting gulag

what do you want
am i disturbing you
yes
then i will leave
no wait wait id rather talk to someone why do you have yellow eyes
i am an android i believe you and i have something in common
we do
yes we have both been programmed
ah yes yes youve been talking to counsellor troi it is not at all the same android
i do not mean to belittle your condition i understand your dilemma but i am curious my programme can be altered yours cannot
the man i was is still inside me but this conditioning has been imposed woven together with my thoughts and my feelings and my responses how do you separate the programme from the man
without further analysis of your condition from counsellor troi or doctor crusher i cannot say but i believe it is possible
yeah doctors the angosian doctors did this to me if it could be undone wouldnt they undo it
i cannot answer that
nor can i yet i ask myself that question every moment of every day

captain what this man has been telling you is full of halftruths hes a prisoner what do you expect him to say about us
well perhaps you would clarify it for me
the soldiers were resettled on lunar five it was to be their colony
was it a resettlement of their choosing
it was for their own protection as well as that of others most of them were quite happy there we went to great lengths to give them a fine quality of life
prime minister even the most comfortable prison is a prison
unfortunately a few agitators like danar forced us to add security
my medical team suggests there may be alternative treatment
captain i assure you that every alternative has been explored and this discussion is now treading upon matters of internal security which is not your concern i have dispatched a ship to rendezvous with you to transport the prisoner back to lunar five on behalf of angosia i thank the federation for its assistance in retrieving our citizen

matter of internal security the ageold cry of the oppressor

were you built for combat android
no but my programme does include military strategy that is how i was able to anticipate your final tactic and capture you
you did that perhaps you would be better at combat than you think
except that i am not programmed to kill
my improved reflexes have allowed me to kill eighty four times and my improved memory lets me remember each of those eighty four faces can you understand how that feels
i am incapable of any feeling
why then i envy you

roga this is captain picard
captain
mister danar im transferring you to angosian security theyre en route they will arrive shortly i wanted to tell you i have no choice the prime minister insisted and we have no right to refuse
you would be foolish to consider it otherwise captain for they are very correct i am dangerous there is no place for me in a civilised society
i do not believe that
nor do i
i respect my officers judgements i wish i could help further if a way appears to me i will
i appreciate your telling me that face to face
i thought you deserved that much
and you deserve to know that i must use whatever means i can to escape
captain the angosian transport vessel has arrived
inform them the transfer will take place shortly picard out mister data to the bridge please

take care of yourself android i enjoyed our talk
i too

perhaps when this planet becomes a member of the federation well be able
i will not be there to see it counsellor because even with this overwhelming demand to survive that theyve built into my soul i would rather die than return to lunar five

captain picard were ready to receive the prisoner now transmitting the coordinates of our holding cell
coordinates received sir
stand by for transport picard out mister worf have all security precautions been taken
release of the force field and activation of the transporter will be virtually simultaneous there will only be a point one second difference between them
even danar cant move that fast
there will be a full security contingent present
proceed

transporter room one to lieutenant worf were ready sir

energising

obrien increase transporter power


im losing him


roga dont youll be killed


what the hell


security personnel full alert shut down all shuttlebays transporters and turbolifts
captain a phaser is missing

we must assume that he is armed

sound general quarters clear corridors of all nonessential personnel i dont want him taking any hostages
general quarters sounded sir
raise security containment fields immediately on decks thirty four thirty five and thirty six
aye sir
data put the turbolifts back online if danar sees theyre operating he may try to use them soon as he does we have him



sir unauthorised access of turbolift five on deck thirty four
he took the bait
data override its destination divert that turbolift to a position near lieutenant worfs present location
four seconds to arrival sir

were in position

phaser on overload seal this deck


captain the overload has been averted


drop force field on deck thirty six

sir containment field down on deck thirty six
how the hell did he manage that
hes headed for engineering
riker to la forge engineering respond


engineering engineering come in geordi are you okay


captain someone in engineering is attempting to override the security system lockout
riker to worf hes in engineering

acknowledged commander were on our way

data i want you to stall danar allow him to think hes succeeding
as he bypasses each subsystem i can reroute it without his knowledge
make it so
danar is extremely adept sir i am not certain which security measure he is attempting to circumvent sir danar has succeeded in restoring power to shuttlebay two

i have overridden danars bypass shuttlebay two is once again inactive
very good mister data now we know where hes headed


geordi
im all right he took us by surprise he came out of nowhere i didnt think anyone could move that fast
lieutenant i am reading an open panel k twelve j nine deck thirty
acknowledged
danar must have climbed up the reactor core and got into a jefferies tube he could be anywhere
we believe he is attempting to reach shuttlebay two
thats twenty five decks up from here quite a climb but i wouldnt put it past him
there is a full contingent of security at all shuttlebays
you want my advice double it

captain reading another open access panel
security team to jefferies tube j four deck fifteen
security acknowledged

deck fifteen a few decks below the shuttlebay
sir i find it highly unlikely that danar would be attempting to reach shuttlebay two
explain
in our previous encounter danar employed a strategy of misdirection in an attempt to gain his objective
and you believe hes using the same tactic now
he is aware that our sensors are unable to track him yet he seems to be purposely leaving a trail for us to follow
where do you think hes headed
i am afraid his true destination remains a mystery readings now indicate an open access panel in jeffries tube n eleven deck thirty eight
hes doubled back on us
the cargo bays
advise all personnel on deck thirty eight to stay out of the cargo bays

status mister data
they appear to be empty sir
good i want you to flood them with anestazine
aye sir

sensors show anestazine concentration seventy parts per million within the cargo bays
that should have put our boy to sleep
return environmental conditions to normal mister data move in your security teams mister worf
acknowledged

worf to bridge we have found no sign of the intruder but there is a missing pressure suit

from cargo bay three
pressure suit
could be hes planning to enter shuttlebay two from outside the enterprise bypassing the security guards
mister worf post security guards at all emergency airlocks on decks

thirty seven through thirty nine
aye sir ill also cover the photon torpedo launchers danar may attempt to leave the ship that way worf out

danar you are cunning you must have klingon blood but the battle is over
my battle is never over
worf to bridge i have danar


explosion in jefferies tube section t nine five all external sensors inoperative
go to backup systems
unable to transfer control sir



sit down gentlemen

worf to bridge
go ahead
danar has escaped

he used a phaser to power the cargo transporter coordinates indicate he beamed aboard the angosian transport ship
data can you verify that
negative sir all external sensors still nonfunctioning
then we have no way to track him
that was his plan all along
first officers log supplemental we are continuing to repair damage to the ships sensors following the escape of the angosian prisoner danar he is still at large

engineering im getting readings on tactical are we back up
thats affirmative commander
mister worf sweep the area
captain the prime minister is hailing us priority one
on screen
priority channel cleared
yes prime minister
captain ive just been informed that roga danar has attacked the penal colony on lunar five
attacked it 
in our own police shuttle several of my people have been wounded hundreds of prisoners are rioting some of them have escaped with danar and at last report are headed to the capital city captain we are not suited to handle situations like this thats what we created them for
ill send an away team prime minister picard out counsellor troi commander data mister worf you will accompany me to the planet

and my understanding is these men are programmed to survive is that correct
yes captain
and that they will not kill unless their survival is at stake
it is against their nature to do so captain
then let us hope they do not believe their survival is at stake
mister worf you are personally responsible for the captains safety
i understand commander


i dont expect them to listen to reason i loathe the idea of a violent confrontation but we must be prepared

this is all youve brought where are your security men
were not here to fight your wars for you
they have been seen moving toward the center of the city people are scared dont you understand captain theyre dangerous
you are dangerous theyre only victims you made them what they are you asked them to defend your way of life and then you discarded them
they were not happy here
they were not welcome here
it was the will of the people to resettle them
no one was pleased with the solution but we had to act for the greater good
prime minister if you have the skills to create a master soldier can you not contradict the effect
the chemicals can be removed from their systems but were not convinced that the psychological conditioning can ever be entirely reversed
have you tried sir
we studied it thoroughly even before the training began we knew there would be problems reversing it it was a risk we had to take
did you reveal that risk to the men who volunteered for service
we were helping them to survive the war you understand they needed these skills
theyre your brothers your sons and you turned your backs on them
there are methods of treatment until you try them how can you know they wont work even a partial recovery could give them some peace
it was the will of the people
to allow them to suffer
there was a referendum the people weighed the costs involved they chose the resettlement solution
besides we may need to use them again some day
have you understood one word that weve said

freeze nobody move
no worf all of you dont respond dont provoke them further keep those weapons down unless you wish to be killed
do as he says
no dont shoot us destroy us do what you have to do but you will not ignore us go on do it

cowards
yes and you are not programmed to murder cowards so if they will not fight back what will you do
we will not go back
you are programmed to survive you can survive at the lunar five settlement
to survive is not enough to simply exist is not enough
roga tell them what you want
we want our lives back we want to come home
i am not prepared to negotiate under threat danar but if you will put down your weapons and return peaceably to lunar five i would be willing
mister prime minister with all due respect you will have to force us or at least try
captain you must do something call your ship
quite right prime minister enterprise prepare to beam the away team back
at your command captain
picard you cant leave us like this
i have all the information i need for our report your prisoner has been returned to you and you have a decision to make whether to try to force them back or welcome them home in your own words this is not our affair we cannot interfere in the natural course of your societys development and id say its likely to develop significantly in the next several minutes its been an interesting visit when youre ready for membership the federation will be pleased to reconsider your application mister riker four to beam up
aye sir

success captain
number one will you note in our report that if the government of angosia survives the night we will offer them federation assistance in their efforts to reprogram their veterans
and if the government doesnt survive
i have a feeling they will choose to mister crusher set coordinates for starbase lya three
coordinates set captain
engage
the high ground


captains log stardate  the enterprise has put in at rutia four to deliver medical supplies following an outbreak of violent protests although nonaligned the planet has enjoyed a long trading relationship with the federation now a generation of peace has ended with terrorist attacks by ansata separatists who are demanding autonomy and selfdetermination for their homeland on the western continent recreational shore leave has been prohibited and all away teams have been beam down armed


we have only a few minutes before our next meeting doctor
its all right were finished waiter

doctor

keep back
put that away im a doctor  just lie still try not to move
lieutenant worf i need some bandages disinfectant something with alcohol in it
doctor it is not safe
thats an order lieutenant

dont be afraid theres a lot of bleeding but its not as bad as it looks
the klingons right these ansata theyre madmen there could be another bomb  clear this area everyone out of the plaza
doctor i believe it would be prudent to return to the enterprise there are physicians on this planet
who are not here i am
doctor

thank you

thank you
not at all doctor
captain there has been an incident

a bomb has been detonated by ansata terrorists
your security status
vulnerable sir
transporter room three lock onto the away team prepare to beam them back
yes captain

sir ive recommended such a course but there are several wounded people and doctor crusher

is insisting on attending to
i understand picard to doctor crusher

go ahead
doctor commander data has informed me of your situation
i already know what youre going to say
doctor will you at least allow me to
the longer we argue the longer

its going to take me to save
doctor you are endangering yourself and the away team

captain i am trying to put life back into a wounded body with sleight of hand im not going anywhere data and worf

dont have to stay crusher out
transporter room do you have lock on the away team
aye sir shall i transport them
i dont want to be in the transporter room to greet her
commander data

hold your position until the rutian medics arrive
aye sir
the tricorder is not reading any other explosive devices in this vicinity

get out of the way

you dont understand im a


a transporter would leave residual ionization in the air our tricorder readings found no trace after the incident
people dont just appear and disappear there must be some way to track her
we have been unable to detect a signal from her communicator either it has been deactivated or she is being held in a shielded location
why her
sir i believe she was the intended target of the abduction
why would they want to take a federation hostage their fight doesnt involve us
it does now


you hungry you want something to eat

i doesnt matter to me you want to be hungry be hungry whats your name youre a doctor on a federation starship i always wondered what it would be like to travel across the galaxy its not something ive exactly had time for this isnt the best way to meet new people is it if you need anything ask for me my name is kyril finn they know me

we have no reason to believe shes been hurt in any way
in fact its more than likely that they will take good care of her if they want to use her as a bargaining chip
bargaining chip
the innocent often become the pawns in conflicts of this type wes
you see the ansata separatists have been trying for generations to freed themselves from the rule of the eastern continent if they can get the government just to acknowledge their demands then kidnapping your mother will have served its purpose i think that may be what theyre after but it may not frankly wesley i dont care my only concern is to get your mother back very shortly we shall be leaving to have a meeting with the authorities
request permission to be on the away team sir
no you have an important job to do here if we are to free your mother then we have to be able to trace the movements of the terrorists i want you to work with the team that are investigating this new technology of theirs
i understand
report to mister data dismissed

he needs your strength right now
history has shown us that strength may be useless when faced with terrorism


and what exactly is ansata policy with regard to hostages
i doubt they have one they dont usually take hostages these are not people were dealing with here theyre animals fanatics who kill without remorse or conscience who think nothing of murdering innocent people
but they could just as easily have shot her where she stood
dont ask me to explain them i cant the atrocities that ive seen and now they have this new device that makes them even more deadly how do i combat an enemy who fails to register on any scanner until theyre literally standing in front of you pointing a phaser at your head
what can you tell us about this device
not much really they first started using it two months ago weve taken several of these off dead terrorists our people have looked at them nothing they can explain
do you mind if we take one of these with us and have our people study it
not at all and ill put you in touch with our research people if you wish
i appreciate your help
perhaps if we found ourselves in possession of some of that advanced federation weaponry of yours it would shift the balance of power back to our favour
of course you know that is out of the question
yes of course
i would like to leave commander riker to assist in your search for doctor crusher
if you like
you dont sound very optimistic
i know my enemy commander they dont leave much room for optimism


you hungry you want something to eat relax relax im just going to

now eat something whats the point of not eating youre the only one who suffers do i look like its bothering me okay its bothering me come on

no forks sorry did i mention my name is finn and youre
why have you brought me here
i need a doctor
there are doctors on rutia
i need someone better i heard you were with the federation flagship and i knew you had to be
who told you that
i heard now youll help me just like you helped them
what are you talking about
your ship carries medical supplies for them for the other side why does the federation ally itself with the rutians
we dont all we did was bring
medical supplies
people were hurt
i know i hurt them youre finished eating get up get up
i have a son
youll be with him again doctor i see no reason to kill you


i need some instruments from my ship in order to diagnose this
you think if i allow you to contact your ship they will transport the instruments
when i inform the captain how serious the situation is im sure hell agree ive told you finn the federation is not allied with rutians were here on an errand of mercy
and since the federation does not wish to take sides they will send the supplies that you need
absolutely
ive anticipated your needs

these are federation supplies the ones we had delivered to the medical dispensary
i heard

you mean to tell me all these people belong to the ansata
no not really we suspect the organisation itself only to consist of some two hundred members there are over five thousand names on this list citizens we know to be sympathetic to their cause they pass along weaponry and information march in proansata demonstrations participate in general strikes or the occasional riot
how did this ever get started
seventy years ago we denied them independence that gave them a noble cause now its just an excuse for more violence
you hate them as much as they hate you
believe it or not i always considered myself moderate
what changed your mind
being stationed here for six months watching the body count grow the three assassination attempts on my life
well thatll change your point of view
the event that really opened my eyes took place only a few days after my arrival a terrorist bomb destroyed a shuttlebus sixty schoolchildren there were no survivors the ansata claimed that it was a mistake that their intended target was a police transport as if that made everything all right that day i vowed that i would put an end to terrorism in this city and i will


thank you youre very helpful you could learn to do this when you grow up if you grow up

theyre dying im seeing a complicated set of conditions their dna is warped somehow and its distorting their entire cellular chemistry
you cant do anything
i can make them more comfortable thats all the damage is too extensive

if i could detect their condition earlier
you could reverse the damage
perhaps i dont know what happened to them
its the inverter its given our cause a new life but it asks for our lives in return
what does it do
we transport through a dimensional shift that the rutian sensors cant trace
dimensional shifting you cant do that with humanoid tissue
there are risks the designers told us but it works
youre showing the same distorted readings not as severe as the others but
it doesnt matter
it does if it kills you
dont you know a dead martyrs worth ten posturing leaders


a subspace field coil with an isolated power source curious
hey guys come here look at this the rutian team picked up a faint nuclear vibration during the terrorist movements
nuclear vibration
that could possibly indicate subspace transition rebound during transport
wait a minute wait a minute may i computer call up the files on what was his name we spent two hours on him in astral physics last year foldedspace transport
adaptive transport
yes
are you referring to the elway theorem
yes computer call up the files on the elway theorem what if theyre using interdimensional travel
but the elway theorem proved to be entirely inaccurate all research was abandoned by the midtwenty third century
but data look the nuclear vibrations are the same and elway used a model similar to this
it would certainly be untraceable by any standard method of detection
but it was proven to be fatal to use this technology would be an irrational act
we may be dealing with irrational people data is there a way to trace this
with an adaptive subspace echogram maybe
captain anyone who is willing to transport in this manner would suffer significant internal damage that could be detected
it sounds as though they may require the services of a doctor


this is no way to live
for us or them
for both of you
i know its not pretty riker but this is what terrorism has done to this city
theres got to be a better way to deal with it than this
my methods may seem harsh but believe me theyre gentle compared to my predecessors suspects would be brought into police headquarters and mysteriously vanish i put a stop to that
what happened to your predecessors
they were murdered
are you going to tell me that little boys a threat

its possible that shuttlebus i told you about the bomb was set by a teenager in a world where children blow up children everyones a threat


its okay over there

you should be drawing not killing people
i can do both
how can you have such a casual attitude toward killing
i take my killing very seriously doctor you are an idealist
i live in an ideal culture theres no need for your kind of violence weve proven that
your origins on earth are from the american continent are they not
north america
yes ive read your history books this is a war for independence and i am no different than your own george washington
washington was a military general not a terrorist
the difference between generals and terrorists doctor is only the difference between winners and losers you win youre called a general you lose
you are killing innocent people cant you see the immorality of what youre doing or have you killed so much youve become blind to it
how much innocent blood has been spilled for the cause of freedom in the history of your federation doctor how many good and noble societies have bombed civilians in war have wiped out whole cities and now that you enjoy the comfort that has come from their battles their killing you frown on my immorality i am willing to die for my freedom doctor and in the finest tradition of your own great civilisation im willing to kill for it too

all right you can go

next man
if you want i could become more persuasive
no

youre katik shaw the waiter from the lumar cafe you witnessed both the explosion and the kidnapping
i saw nothing
were aware of your ties with the ansata for all we know you planted the bomb yourself where have they taken her
i dont know what youre talking about
ive had enough of this i want you to take a message back to your people you tell them the federation is willing to negotiate for the release of doctor crusher
riker
shes a starfleet officer shes my responsibility your people have terms were willing to listen we want her back its as simple as that i dont think its necessary to detain this gentleman any longer
get out

i should have him followed but well try it your way
is that what you want
what i want is to go home back to my own country to leave behind the roundups the interrogations the bodies lying in the street to be able to walk without bodyguards and to not have to jump at every unexpected noise thats what i want riker

a dimensional jump can create subspace pressure modulation captain by setting up a magnetosphere echogram that can monitor each of their movements we may be able to collect enough data to trace their power source
can you estimate the number of jumps it will take
dimensional shifting is such an unstable procedure sir that i cannot say sir i am finding it difficult to understand many aspects of ansata conduct much of their behavioral norm would be defined by my programme as unnecessary and unacceptable
by my programme as well data
but if that is so captain why are their methods so often successful i have been reviewing the history of armed rebellion and it appears that terrorism is an effective way to promote political change
yes it can be but i have never subscribed to the theory that political power flows from the barrel of a gun
yet there are numerous examples where it was successful the independence of the mexican state from spain the irish unification of  and the kensey rebellion
yes i am aware of them
then would it be accurate to say that terrorism is acceptable when all options for peaceful settlement have been foreclosed
data these are questions that mankind has been struggling with throughout history your confusion is only human

finn everyone is being rounded up
because of her
the federation wants to negotiate her release
while they arrange for the rutian police to fill up the detention cells
a starfleet officer is working with the director he wants a meeting with you
im sure he does your federation colleagues have engineered mass arrests to pressure me into releasing you
im sure youve misunderstood
theyre working with the police hes seen it with his own eyes
all they want is to get me back safely
im not releasing you i need you here
to find a way to reverse the effects of the dimensional shift i can do that right now stop using it i have a life finn i have a son who needs me
is your son on the ship
yes
im sorry hes on the ship
no
they have joined forces with the rutians against us
we are not your enemy
they are more valuable to me than an enemy for seventy years we have shouted and no ones heard us destroy the federation flagship someone will listen
please
they are the ones who interfered they are the ones who sent medical supplies they are the ones who organised mass arrests they are killing your son not me
please finn dont do this i will do anything you ask
i had a son too he was thirteen when he died in detention


what


intruder alert deck twelve
another subspace reflection dimensional shift sir
go to red alert sound general quarters


security to engineering


intruders in engineering
casualties reported on deck twelve sickbay responding
seal off all decks lock on transporters to the intruder signals
intruder signals unstable captain i cannot lock on
they are moving interdimensionally neither transporters nor forcefields will contain them sir


explosive charge on the main warp chamber

transporter room three lock on the explosive device and energise
its scrambling the sensors captain i cant pinpoint it
begin emergency evacuation stand by for saucer separation mister la forge can you remove the charge from the engine core
im trying hold on

theyve got it locked on somehow stand by

transporter room lock on my signal and stand by to transport two kilometres off the starboard nacelle

his signal

transporter room now


mister la forge report

transport complete captain i have a man down

more dimensional shifts sir
can you calibrate their destination
no sir the readings are

security code one emergency security





lieutenant worf is recovering in sickbay the wound was not severe
dead injured
three dead four wounded
another millisecond thered have been a big dust cloud orbiting rutia instead of the enterprise
why i just asked if they would talk
you have your answer riker
sir the next time the ansata use their dimensional jump we should be able to get a fix on the power source

worf went down i dont know if hes alive or dead and there were other casualties
was wes on the bridge
yes he took cover i didnt see any more than that but you all right though
yes they needed a doctor
the side effects of the transport
yes
were getting closer to tracing their movements actually it was wesley who put us onto this dimensional jump of theirs he has been extraordinary beverly hes going to make a very fine officer
hes had good role models im sorry if id only gone back to the ship
i should have beamed you up
you wouldnt dare
oh yes i would and should
without my permission
if you dont follow orders
if youd give reasonable orders id obey
doctor i will be the judge of reasonable
there arent any exits to the surface
so the only way out is by the transporter or the dimensional jump
a mode of travel id encourage you to avoid its killing them
theyre mad
i dont know any more the difference between a madman and a committed man willing to die for a cause its all become blurred over the last few days
beverly i dont have to remind you of the psychological impact of being a hostage
i know i understand that but their leader finn hes not what youd expect
no hes certainly not what i would expect without cause or reason he and his little band of outlaws has attacked my ship
but he did have reasons the medical supplies the arrests jeanluc if we really examined our role in all this
beverly you are arguing for a man who may have murdered your son
i didnt kill your son beverly we werent able to destroy the ship we had to settle for him she wouldnt even tell me her name i call her doctor
you have made a grave miscalculation
oh
you have assaulted a federation starship killed and wounded several members of her crew kidnapped two of her officers and you dont expect a response
on the contrary im counting on it
you want federation involvement
captain the federation has a lot to admire in it but theres a hint of moral cowardice in your dealings with nonaligned planets youre doing business with a government that is crushing us and you say youre not involved youre very very much involved you just dont want to get dirty
you accuse us of cowardice while you plant bombs in shadows
i am been fighting the only war that i can against an intractable enemy now im fighting a big war against a more powerful adversary cant you see how that helps me
im afraid i cant
hes added another chair to the negotiating table
you added the chair captain i am simply forcing you to sit in it the federation will quickly tire of our little war theyll want you back they will want to get as far away from rutia as they can and i will not make it easy eventually the federation will force the government into make concessions and then a few more and then a few more until we can finally reach an honourable agreement that saves face for all sides except we win
you understand i will not cooperate with you in any way
youve already cooperated captain just by coming here


i am not here to hurt you just hear what i have to say your people are safe how long they stay that way depends on you we demand an embargo and trade sanctions levied against rutia the federation will blockade the planet no ships will be allowed in or out this will continue until the government of rutia consents to talks mediated by a federation council you have twelve hours to make your decision

got it weve pinpointed the ansata base to some three hundred kilometres from the city on the southern tip of the continent
sensors indicate it is located thirty metres below the ground implying a cavernlike dwelling
any passages leading to the surface
our readings show no evidence of any commander
any light they have must be artificially generated
if we could shut that down you could use the confusion to find your people
request permission to join the rescue party sir i owe it to the captain
permission granted you have the bridge mister data
aye sir
commander good luck
well bring her home wes

youre glad to see your captain
yes
i may have to kill him i just wanted to warn you
he can help you finn he is very influential
he will not help us
if you could just convince him that your cause is
you may be able to convince him perhaps not i
ive talked to him ill try
if our places were reversed i would expect to die
your places would never be reversed he would never forcibly abduct you or play games with your life he would treat you with respect
ive treated you with respect
youve scared the hell out of me finn youve controlled me through fear just like youve tried to control this whole continent
you havent tasted real fear yet doctor
is that the best you can do is fear the only weapon you have
no but its a good one
you know what scares me the most finn it scares me to think that you might win this fight and gain real power
doctor i dont want you to fear me



generators right over there

beverly how dangerous would another ride through the inverter be to us
i dont know but i dont want you to start thinking about
beverly it is our obligation to think of escape
hes prepared to kill you
an excellent reason to escape do you think youve gained his confidence

indeed you have and more this might prove to be an advantage to us
jeanluc there are some things i want to tell you in case we dont get out of this

have they found us


turn those circuits on sandor come with me do we have any emergency power

freeze hold it right there hands up hands up lets go


finn

hes dead
you didnt have to kill him
as a prisoner he would have been a focus for violence as his followers tried to free him now hes a martyr but the death toll might go down at least in the short term its an imperfect solution for an imperfect world

riker
no more killing

already another one to take his place it never ends
he could have killed you he didnt maybe the end begins with one boy putting down his gun


i hear i owe my rescue to you
i was just part of the team its good to have you back both of you sir
take us out of orbit mister crusher at your convenience
dj q

captains log stardate  we have moved into orbit around breel four with the assistance of the planets emergency control centre were investigating a potentially catastrophic threat to the population from a descending asteroidal moon

the satellites trajectory is continuing to deteriorate captain this orbit will put it within five hundred kilometres of the planet surface
were predicting the atmospheric drag will bring it down on the next orbit
have you been able to find any explanation for this
no doctor it is a most unusual phenomenon
wont the moon disintegrate prior to impact
no it has a ferrous crystalline structure and it will be able to withstand tidal forces captain
could we blow it into pieces
the total mass of the moon would remain the same commander and the impact of thousands of fragments would spread destruction over an even wider area
how long before impact
twenty nine hours sir projecting it somewhere on the western continent that would destroy an area eight hundred kilometres in radius
that damage would be insignificant captain compared to the seismic repercussions massive landquakes and tsunami
the force would raise a cloud of dust around the planet leading to a significant temperature reduction we could be looking at our own ice age
mister la forge is there any way that the enterprise could coax that satellite

back where it belongs
wed need to apply a delta vee of about four kilometres per second even with warp power to the tractor beam it would mean exceeding recommended impulse engine output by at least fortyseven percent itd be like

an ant pushing a tricycle a slim chance at best
given a choice between slim and none ill take slim any day
make it so
lieutenant worf contact all ships in this sector to rendezvous and join us in relief efforts
well keep you informed of our progress picard out

can you give us any more geordi
not without burning out the tractor beam emitter the circuits are already beyond the thermal limit
delta vee is ninety two metres per second the mass is too great we are having an effect but it is negligible

what is that
unable to identify source

impulse engines passing safety limits were seconds

from automatic shutdown
reduce engine power tractor beam off
lieutenant worf what the hell do the sensors say
the sound is not registering commander

q
red alert
captains log supplemental we are no closer to finding a solution to the deteriorating orbit of the breel four moon but with the arrival of q we now have a good idea of the cause

our options
weve done everything by the book and a little extra we need more time or more power and were short on both ill take a look and see if there are any rules i havent broken
keep me advised

we know youre behind this q
these arent my colours and what are you blathering about riker
what kind of twisted pleasure does it give you to bring terror into their lives
whose lives
the millions of people down there who are watching as their moon falls out of the sky
i havent the vaguest idea what youre talking about and i have a much more serious problem im no longer a member of the continuum my superiors have decided to punish me
and punish us as well it would seem
they said ive spread chaos through the universe and theyve stripped me of all my powers you dont believe me do you do you think i would humiliate myself like this
if it served your purpose yes
its the truth i stand before you defrocked condemned to be a member of this lowest of species a normal imperfect lumpen human being
they made you human as part of your punishment
no it was my request i could have chosen to exist as a markoffian sea lizard or a belzoidian flea anything i wished as long as it was mortal and since i only had a fraction of a second to mull and i chose this and asked them to bring me here
why
because in all the universe youre the closest thing i have to a friend jeanluc
sir he is reading as fully human
what is there an echo in here
i am sensing an emotional presence captain i would normally describe it as being terrified
how rude
what is it you want q
your compassion all right sanctuary on this ship dreary as it may sound to both of us
return that moon to its orbit
i have no powers q the ordinary
q the liar q the misanthrope
q the miserable q the desperate what must i do to convince you people
die
oh very clever worf eat any good books lately
fine you want to be treated as a human
absolutely
all right mister worf throw him in the brig
delighted captain
you cant do this to me jeanluc
you will walk or i will carry you
given the option ill walk youve disappointed me jeanluc im very disappointed hey im claustrophobic i dont like it in here

it was a mistake i never should have picked human i knew it the minute i said it to think of the future in this shell forced to cover myself with fabric because of some outdated human morality to say nothing of being too hot or too cold growing feeble with age losing my hair catching a disease being ticklish sneezing having an itch a pimple bad breath having to bathe
too bad

klingon i should have said klingon in my heart of hearts i am a klingon worf

sorry so you understand i could never survive in confinement i mean this is cruel and unusual punishment the universe has been my back yard as a fellow klingon if you would speak to the captain on my behalf i would be eternally grateful which doesnt mean as much as it used to i admit
be quiet or disappear back where you came from
i cant disappear any more than you could win a beauty contest

if i ask a very simple question do you think you might be able to answer it without it troubling your intellect too much 
ready here goes would i permit you to lock me away if i still had all my powers
you have fooled us too often q
perspicacity incarnate please dont feel compelled now to tell me the story of the boy who cried worf
computer activate force field
i demand to be let out of here immediately do you hear me you will deactivate this cell immediately romulan

i should have said romulan that klingon goat

the question is what sort of jaded game is he up to this time
maybe he just wants a big laugh hell take breel four to the edge of disaster and then pull the moon back
or he may have nothing to do with it at all
you honestly think q is telling the truth
oh i agree this is highly unlikely but we have to proceed with our current dilemma as though q is powerless to prevent it dont we
and there he sits and he watches us struggle
i dont see that we have any choice mister worf will you hail the breel four science station
theyre standing by captain
yes captain picard
im sorry but i have to report that our first attempt to restore the moon to its proper orbit has failed
we have less than twenty five hours before impact captain
our chief engineer is working on ways to reinforce our tractor beam
so there is a hope but if you have an evacuation plan
we have already started moving people from the coastal areas of the western continent
we are going to make another attempt shortly picard out
ive got to tell you geordi is not at all optimistic

what the devil


data
sensors are showing broadband emissions including berthold rays
lethal
no commander overall exposure is less than seventy five rems very low intensity more like a soft medical scan i would speculate we are being probed
by whom
the sensors cannot identify the point of origin it seems to be coming from all around us


ah youve come to apologise how nice alls forgiven no offense taken
enough q what exactly is going on
well how can i know whats going on ive been in this dungeon of yours alone helpless bored to tears
we have a moon inexplicably falling out of orbit and just now this ship was probed with berthold radiation
i wasnt aware of this truthfully jeanluc i have been entirely preoccupied by a most frightening experience of my own a couple of hours ago i realising that my body was no longer functioning properly i felt weak i could no longer stand the life was oozing out of me i lost consciousness
you fell asleep
terrifying how can you stand it day after day
you get used to it
what other dangers await me im not prepared for this i need guidance
q im not going to play along with this if you want to continue this charade you can do it alone
jeanluc wait  this is getting on my nerves now that i have them you have a moon in a deteriorating orbit ive known moons through the universe big ones small ones im an expert i could help you with this one if you let me out of here
q there are millions of lives at risk if you have the power to
i dont have any powers but i have the knowledge locked up in this puny brain you cannot afford to not take that advantage can you
mister data report to detention cell three
on my way sir
computer remove the forcefield if you are human which i seriously doubt you will have to work hard to earn our trust
im not worried about that jeanluc you only dislike me there are others in the cosmos who truly despise me

mister data you are hereby assigned to q for the remainder of his stay you will escort him to mister la forge in engineering
aye sir

can i have a starfleet uniform what are you looking at
i was considering the possibility that you are telling the truth that you really are human
its the ghastly truth mister data i can now stub my toe with the best of them
an irony it means that you have achieved in disgrace what i have always aspired to be

humans are such commonplace little creatures they roam the galaxy looking for something they know not what
the human race has an enduring desire for knowledge and for new opportunities to improve itself
theres certainly room for improvement but the truth is data they are a minor species in the grand scheme not worth your envy
oh i do not feel envy
well thats good
i feel nothing at all that is part of my dilemma i have the curiosity of humans but there are questions i will never have the answer to what is it like to laugh or cry or to experience any human emotions
well if you ask me these human emotions are not what theyre cracked up to be

the moon will hit its perigee in ten hours now we match its trajectory increase emitter coolant rate so we can apply continuous warpequivalent power nine to the tractor beam we can push it for nearly seven hours and i think that just might do it but theres a problem
the enterprise will be dangerously close to the atmosphere
thats the problem
this is incredible
you see something here q
i think i just hurt my back im feeling pain i dont like it whats the right thing to say ow
ow
ow i cant straighten up
medical assistance to engineering
q ive got a few people down on breel four who are going to be hurt
yes yes your marvellous plan will not only tear the moon to pieces but your precious ship as well
you got a better idea
i would certainly begin by examining the cause and not the symptom
weve done that q and theres no way to
this is obviously the result of a large celestial object passing through at near right angles to the plane of the star system probably a black hole
can you recommend a way to counter the effect
simple change the gravitational constant of the universe
what
change the gravitational constant of the universe thereby altering the mass of the asteroid
redefine gravity how am i supposed to do that
you just do it wheres that doctor anyway
geordi is trying to say that changing the gravitational constant of the universe is beyond our capabilities
oh in that case never mind

ah doctor crusher i see starfleet has shipped you back into exile
q says he has hurt his back
ah ha well if i didnt see it with my own eyes i wouldnt believe it according to this he has classic back trauma muscle spasms
ive been under a lot of pressure lately family problems
well dont expect too much sympathy from me youve been a pain in our backside often enough
your bedside manner is admirable doctor im sure your patients recover quickly just to get away from you
you know this might work we cant change the gravitational constant of the universe but if we wrap a low level warp field around that moon we could reduce its gravitational constant make it lighter so we can push it
glad i could help ow i think
now what
theres something wrong with my stomach
it hurts
its making noises
maybe youre hungry

ive never eaten before what do i ask for
the choice of meal is determined by individual taste
what do you like
although i do not require sustenance i occasionally ingest semiorganic nutrient suspension in a siliconbased liquid medium
is it good
it would be more accurate to say it is good for me as it lubricates my biofunctions
it doesnt sound very appealing what else is there
a wide variety of items the replicator can make anything you desire
how do i know what i desire
i have observed that the selection of food is often influenced by the mood of the person ordering
im in a dreadful mood get me something appropriate
when counsellor troi is unhappy she usually eats something chocolate
chocolate
a chocolate sundae for example although i do not speak from personal experience i have seen it have a profound psychological impact
ill have ten chocolate sundaes
ten
ive never seen anyone eat ten chocolate sundaes
im in a really bad mood and since ive never eaten before i should be very hungry

this is not a moment ive been looking forward to
i hear they drummed you out of the continuum
i like to think of it as a significant career change
just one of the boys ay
one of the boys with an iq of two thousand and five
the captain and many of the crew are not yet convinced he is truly human
really

argh
seems human enough to me
this is a dangerous creature you have no idea why picard would make her a member of the crew and not me
it must be terribly frightening for you to be totally defenceless after all of those centuries being omnipotent
im warning you i still have friends in high places
frightening one race after the other teasing them like frightened animals and you enjoying every moment of your victims fears
from now on ill do missionary work okay
that would be a most noble cause q
you could learn a lot from this one
sure the robot who teaches the course in humanities
i am an android not a robot
i beg your pardon
id enjoy that and youd better get used to it
what
begging youre a pitiful excuse for a human the only way youre going to survive is by the charity of others

im not hungry

captain sensors are picking up a cloud of energetic plasma bearing threefour one mark two zero range twelve kilometres and closing
on screen
energy patterns are reading as highly organized
a lifeform
attempt to make contact mister worf
receiving a signal sir on speaker

computer analyse signal
signal patterns indicate intelligence unable to derive necessary referents to establish translation matrix


whats that i dont know
calamarain


captain were being hit by a field of energetic tachyons penetrating the hull location deck ten forward
red alert
geordi increase power to shields
increasing power by twenty percent
no effect

increasing to forty percent

still no effect



adjusting shield harmonics diverting power to the forward grids

the added harmonics are blocking the tachyon field


help me somebody help me
how the mighty have fallen
captains log supplemental we have sustained light damage from an attack by an alien species known as the calamarain they apparently have a grievance with q no doubt one of many lifeforms that do

the calamarain are not very hospitable creatures they exist as swirls of ionised gas
what did you do to them q
nothing bizarre nothing grotesque
you tormented them
a subjective term riker one creatures torment is another creatures delight they simply have no sense of humour a character flaw with which you can personally identify
i say we turn him over to them
oh i take it back you do have a sense of humour a dreadful one at that
im serious
of course you knew this would happen didnt you
one can never anticipate the calamarain theyre very intelligent but very flighty
yes but you must have so many enemies certainly you knew that once you became mortal some of them might look you up
it had occurred to me
and for all your protestations of friendship your real reason for being here is protection
youre very smart jeanluc but i know human beings theyre all sopping over with compassion and forgiveness they cant wait to absolve almost any offence its an inherent weakness in the breed
on the contrary it is a strength
you call it what you will but i think youll protect me even though ive tortured you now and again
fighting off all the species youve insulted would be a full time mission thats not the one i signed up for
indeed human or not i want no part of you we will deposit you at the first starbase let them deal with you
but i could be a valuable member of the team im human i can learn
he has provided important theoretical guidance for geordis analysis of the breel satellite captain
it seems you have an advocate q
i am merely stating a fact counsellor
mister la forge your status
ive been putting together a programme to extend the forward lobe of the warp field the field coils

arent designed to envelop such a large volume but im attempting to modify their alignment parameters
maintaining field integrity will be difficult geordi
im pretty sure we can do it manually the moon will come to its perigee in fourteen minutes

mister data you will escort q to engineering you will assist mister la forge mister worf hail the breel four science station
aye sir

picard thinks i cant cut it on his starship i can do anything his little trained minions can do
i do not perceive your skills to be in doubt q the captain is more concerned with your ability to interact successfully with his little trained minions
human interpersonal relationships are more complex your experiences may not have adequately prepared you
im not interested in human interpersonal relationships i just want to prove to picard that im indispensable

engineering to function aboard a starship or in any human activity you must learn to form relationships
its so hard
and of more immediate importance is your ability to work within groups
im not good in groups its difficult working in a group when youre omnipotent

the tides reached ten metres on the last orbit they are already beginning to swell again we have a lot of frightened people down here captain
your moon has begun moving toward its perigee were prepared to make our attempt
our population has already taken shelter but im afraid no shelter will be adequate if you fail especially for the people on the western continent
whatever the results we know youve done your best picard its appreciated
well keep you advised doctor picard out
captain sensors are picking up an increased energy output from the calamarain
la forge to bridge

the moon has reached its minimum orbital distance its time captain

well have to lower shields
proceed mister worf keep a close eye on qs friends out there
understood

all right everyone this is what were going to be doing
q everybody already knows what theyre going to do except for you now heres what i need
la forge obviously my knowledge and experience far exceed yours by about a billion times so if youll just step aside gracefully
q your experience will be most valuable to me if you can manually control the field integrity
dont be foolish that would be a waste of my talents
q get to the controls or get the hell out of here data youre my liaison to the bridge ill need you with me
who does he think he is giving me orders
geordi thinks he is in command here and he is correct

engineering holding at station keeping range six hundred and forty metres
containment fields to flight tolerance

warp core to ninety percent
engage field coils tractor beam to stand by field output  field output
two seventeen
impulse engines to full ready to engage tractor beam

lowering shields engage tractor beam

extending warp field forward
engineering is that the forward limit
yes captain we are unable to encompass the entire moon
do you recommend that we proceed
the two parts of the moon will have different inertial densities
stand by captain i can adjust the field symmetry to compensate
i doubt it
you dont know what this ship can do mister yes captain i still believe itll work increasing power and warp field and tractor beam
and if youre wrong the moon will crumble due to subspace compression dont say i didnt warn you
shut up q
i will not be spoken to in this manner
data
q i strongly suggest that you cooperate
inertial mass of the moon is decreasing to approximately two point five million metric tonnes
its working we can move it firing impulse engines

captain the moons trajectory has moved point three percent pointfour percent
emergency shields up
disengage tractor beam
calamarain attacking  shields holding tachyon field repelled
captain the impact of the blast is pushing us into the upper atmosphere

hull temperature rising two thousand degrees

two thousand five hundred degrees
moving to full impulse power
calamarain resuming attack

theyve overpowered the shields hull penetration deck thirty six engineering
geordi can you direct any more power to the shields

we need all the power we have to get out of the atmosphere commander

try activating the structural integrity field

its not working structural field harmonics on manual
la forge hull temperature falling were in the clear
diverting power to forward sections now


that charge nearly knocked out his positronic net
what can you do for him
we can try to discharge and reset the motor pathways recouple the autonomic nodes
theres overpressure in his fluidic systems thermal shock if he was mortal hed be dead
let us not overstate the matter here doctor im mortal and i survived the cheers are overwhelming
q you exceed your own standards of selfpreoccupation you have no concern for an officer who may have saved your life
hes strong hell survive
osmotic pressure still rising maybe we can bypass the flow regulator
it would be helpful if everybody just got out of here now
 stay with q
well let you know as soon as theres anything to tell you
geordi the moons trajectory
all we did was buy ourselves another orbit at most we can try again when the moon comes back to its perigee
and when we drop our shields the calamarains go after q again
commander hes not worth it

come
youre right of course i am extraordinarily selfish but it has served me so well in the past
it will not serve you here
dont be so hard on me jeanluc youve been a mortal all your life you know all about dying ive never given it a second thought or a first one for that matter i could have been killed if it hadnt been for data and that one brief delay he created i would have been gone no more me and no one would have missed me would they data may have sacrificed himself for me why
that is his special nature he learned the lessons of humanity well
when i ask myself if i would have done the same for him and i am forced to answer no i feel i feel ashamed
q im not your father confessor you will receive no absolution from me you have brought nothing but pain and suffering to this crew and im still not entirely convinced that all this isnt your latest attempt at a puerile joke
it is a joke a joke on me the joke of the universe the king who would be man as i learn more and more what it is to be human i am more and more convinced that i would never make a good one i dont have what it takes without my powers im frightened of everything im a coward and im miserable and i cant go on this way


hes going to be all right
were recalibrating his language circuits so he cant talk yet
there are creatures in the universe who would consider you the ultimate achievement android no feelings no emotions no pain and yet you covet those qualities of humanity believe me youre missing nothing but if it means anything to you youre a better human than i

wheres the main shuttlebay
main shuttlebay is located on deck four
take me there

captain an unscheduled shuttle has just been launched
on main viewer hailing frequency
frequencies open
shuttle occupant identify yourself
dont try to talk me out of it jeanluc
q return to the ship immediately
i just cant get used to following orders
captain the plasma cloud is moving toward the shuttle
its easier this way they wont bother you after im gone
engineering prepare to extend shields
please dont fall back on your tired clich of charging to the rescue just in the nick of time i dont want to be rescued my life as a human being has been a dismal failure perhaps my death will have a little dignity
q there is no dignity in this suicide
yes i suppose youre right death of a coward then so be it but as a human i would have died of boredom
this goes against my better judgment transporter room three lock on to shuttle one beam it back into its bay
aye captain
its a perfectly good shuttlecraft
captain unable to transport for some reason i cant lock on to the shuttlecraft
worf are you sensing any sort of interference from the calamarain
no sir but they are still moving toward the shuttle
geordi extend shields around shuttle one
extending shields

commander the shields are frozen
cause
unknown
lock on tractor beam
tractor beam is not functioning either

what the hell is going on

not bad q not great but not bad

q
sacrificing yourself for these humans do i detect a little selfless act
you flatter me i was only trying to put a quick end to a miserable existence
what a dreadful colour
yeah what are you doing here
ive been keeping track of you
i always felt you were in my corner
actually i was the one who got you kicked out you know youre incorrigible q a lost cause i cant go to a single solar system without having to apologise for you and im tired of it
i wasnt the one who misplaced the entire deltived asteroid belt
hey this isnt about me ive got better places to be but somebody had to keep an eye on you to make sure you still didnt find a way to cause trouble even as a member of this limited species
well i hope ive been entertaining you
barely but i find these humans rather interesting im beginning to understand what you see in them after all the things that youve done theyre still intent on keeping you safe
a genetic weakness of the race
and theyre still at it they just tried to beam you up back whatever it is they call it
really
i stopped them
well if the calamarains hurry up and finish me off we can get you back on your way
afraid i had to put them on hold too you see theres still this matter of the selfless act you and i both know that the calamarain would have eventually destroyed the enterprise to get to you and thats really why you left right
it was a teeny bit selfless wasnt it
and theres my problem see i cant back to the continuum and tell them you committed a selfless act just before the end if i do theres going to be questions and explanations for centuries
ive learned my lesson q
remember who youre talking to all knowing all seeing fine you got your powers back try and stay out of trouble

so they wanted to destroy me did they

if you think i tormented you in the past my little friends wait until you see what i do with you now
q
i was just seeing if you were still watching


captain the aliens have disappeared and so has the shuttle
scan the sector
i have sir
well i suppose that is the end of q

au contraire mon capitaine hes back

im forgiven my brothers and sisters of the continuum have taken me back im immortal again omnipotent again
swell
dont fret riker my good fortune is your good fortune

i dont need your fantasy women
oh youre so stolid commander you werent like that before the beard very well

q
but i feel like celebrating
i dont
all right

all of it

now at the risk of being rude
yes once again ive overstayed my welcome as a human i was illequipped to thank you but as myself you have my everlasting gratitude until next time ah but before i go theres a debt i wish to repay to my professor of the humanities data ive decided to give you something very very special
if your intention is to make me human q
no no no no no no i would never curse you by making you human think of it as a going away present

data data why are you laughing
i do not know but it was a wonderful feeling
captain breel four is hailing us

captain picard youve done it
im sorry
the moon its back to its normal orbit how ever you did it thank you

lets see it worf

mister data your analysis
the moons altitude is fifty five thousand kilometres projected orbit is circular there is no further danger to the planet

dont bet on it picard
a matter of perspective



captain we have arrived at tanuga four the away team has completed its survey of doctor apgars work and is ready to return to the ship
good please and feel free to examine the work of the other students too
ensign williams striking style is heavily influenced by geometric constructivism
lieutenant wright has effectively fused the incongruities of the surrealists with the irrationality of dadaism

interesting
oh thank you in what way
while suggesting the free treatment of form usually attributed to fauvism this quite inappropriately attempts to juxtapose the disparate cubistic styles of picasso and leger in addition the use of colour suggests a haphazard mlange of clashing styles furthermore the unsettling overtones of protovulcan influences
thank you mister data
you are welcome sir if i can be of further assistance
no thank you
captains log stardate  after completing a delivery of dicosilium to the tanuga four research station our away team has received an update from doctor nel apgar on his efforts to create krieger waves a potentially valuable new power source

welcome back mister la forge
thank you sir
wheres commander riker
hes still on the station sir doctor apgar wanted to have a word with him
any problems
not with the scientific part of the mission no sir
riker to enterprise im ready to leave now
im sure commander riker will be able to explain everything captain
stand by commander engaging transport

transporter room to engineering i have a power drain


transporter room is commander riker aboard
not yet captain im having trouble clearing the signal

transporter room to bridge

hes aboard

why do you sound so surprised mister obrien
for a moment we werent sure you left the space station in time
in time for what
it just exploded sir
captains log supplemental commander riker has informed me that doctor apgar was the only one aboard the space station when it exploded we remain in orbit investigating the accident

ive gone through the whole system captain i cant find any malfunction in the transporter

nothing that would cause an explosion like that
why was there a power drain before transport
i dont know sir
i shall want an answer to that im sure the tanugans will too
yes sir
captain the radiation and debris are consistent with an overload of the stations reactor core
were there any indications of reactor core problems while you were on the station
no sir
number one mister la forge indicated that this was not an entirely routine mission
its a long story sir but im sure it doesnt have anything to do with this accident
captain chief investigator krag of the tanugan security force requests permission to beam aboard
granted will you escort him to the bridge mister worf
aye sir
perhaps you had tell me as much as possible prior to his arrival number one


im lieutenant worf head of ships security i will take you to the captain

chief investigator welcome to the enterprise im captain picard this is my first officer commander william riker
commander riker i am here to take you into custody
custody on what charge
suspicion of murder
murder now wait a minute you cant come on
chief investigator we are perfectly willing to cooperate with you but
then release the prisoner for transportation to the planet
lets continue this discussion in private number one you have the bridge

just what is the evidence against my officer
two witnesses have come forward to describe commander rikers threats against doctor apgar
threats im aware there was a private conversation between them
apparently it was much more than just a private conversation but he will have a chance to prove his innocence
investigator in our system of jurisprudence a man is innocent until proved guilty
in ours he is guilty until he is proved innocent and you are under our jurisdiction if i understand the federation regulations on these matters and i just happened to look them up before i
i am aware of federation regulations sir and if you investigate them further you will find the captain decides if extradition is warranted
are you saying it is not
im saying if there is sufficient cause to warrant a trial i will release my officer into your custody
would you say youre close to your first officer captain
that question is irrelevant here
really captain you cannot believe that how can i expect a fair and impartial decision
i must protect the rights of my officer
i can appreciate that but you will do it on the planet not here after all what if you were suddenly to decide to leave this star system
you have my word as a starfleet officer that i will not
unacceptable captain you will turn him over to me for interrogation now
interrogate him here
we must recreate step by step moment by moment all the events leading to the explosion we will require access to all the witnesses as well as the data from the labs ground computers it would be impossible to accomplish here
perhaps not mister data will you report to my ready room
aye sir
we may be able to assist you in recreating the events

commander data this is chief investigator krag commander by taking testimony from the away team and from witnesses provided by the investigator would it be possible to programme the holodeck to recreate what happened on the science station
it would require construction and design specifications full orthographic representations of the krieger equipment as well as visual representations and voice analyses of the persons involved but it is possible
very well arrangements will be made to provide you with all available information i shall return shortly with our witnesses
commander will you escort investigator krag to transporter room three

ensign crusher mister la forge we are going to recreate the research station here on the holodeck i want you to work with commander data on the preparations in addition commander la forge and commander riker i want you to give the computer detailed depositions of everything you saw everything you heard while you were on board counsellor i want you to assist me during this inquiry my decision about the extradition will be based upon the evidence presented during these recreations
captain may i have a word with you
under these circumstances number one i think that would be inappropriate
second officers log stardate  programming of the holodeck has taken eighteen hours eleven minutes and is now complete all participants have entered their depositions technical schematics and complete records from the labs ground computers as well as doctor apgars personal logs have been included the recreations will have a nominal eight point seven percent margin of error


is there anything youd like to say before we begin number one
just this im not a murderer i went to the tanugan lab as an official representative of starfleet i acted accordingly i was there to evaluate doctor apgars progress in the development of a krieger wave converter thats all i was interested in computer load deposition programme riker one run the simulation

doctor apgar im commander william riker lieutenant commander geordi la forge
my assistant tayna well lets get on with it shall we
dont be in such a hurry dear perhaps our guests would care for some refreshments
my wife manua
a pleasure to meet you mrs apgar if youre prepared to get started so are we
of course im prepared
all right why dont you give me the overview of your research while mister la forge and your assistant take a look at the experimental data
fine whatever i must say commander i resent this early arrival starfleet will get its converter ive had a few setbacks thats all
were not here to pressure you doctor we just want an update on your progress
tayna show the commanders assistant whatever he wants to see give him full access to our records
yes doctor if youll come with me our lambda field generator is on the planet since it requires a minimum of five thousand kilometres for the field to collimate

really darling youre being rude after all commander riker is willing to sit through all your prattle about krieger waves lets have a drink commander and well hear all about krieger waves



to your success doctor
and the rewards that come with it
riker what is starfleet doing here anyway my delivery wasnt scheduled for another three months
we were in this sector on another mission and since you had already contacted starfleet about additional dicosilium it seemed like a good opportunity
how interesting tell us about this other mission
its just a study of a protostar cloud the enterprisell be back tomorrow
the enterprise just left you here
we didnt want to inconvenience you weve made arrangements for quarters on the planet
i wont hear of such a thing commander i insist you and mister la forge stay with us
i hardly
i know that you would prefer to be alone with your very important work but i for one am glad for the company

good i must apologise for my husbands lack of social graces he may be one of the great scientific minds in the galaxy but he does come up a bit short in other areas
wait a moment stop
computer freeze programme
then its your testimony that it was mrs apgars idea for you to spend the night aboard the space station
its my testimony and its the truth
resume programme

our guest quarters arent luxurious but ive tried to make this room warm and inviting
ill be very comfortable thank you good night
the environmental controls are over here
im sure ill find everything i need
and the door shuts by touching this panel

mrs apgar
this is my sanctuary privacy is very important on a small station im left alone here often for hours
its late i am tired

are you still tired commander
maam excuse me i really think that you ought to leave

i knew id find you with him did you think i didnt notice how you looked at him im not the fool you take me for
doctor

doctor believe me this has been a terrible mistake
you wont get away with this ill see to it i swear i will riker

freeze programme
i didnt see doctor apgar until the following morning when he asked to see me alone commander la forge returned to the enterprise resume programme

i suppose if i make a formal complaint your report on my work wont be very good
doctor this is going to have no impact on my report it was a misunderstanding of the worst kind we could straighten the entire thing out if you would ask mrs apgar to join us
my wife and my assistant have transported down to the planet what are you going to put in your report riker that there is no justification for all the extra dicosilium ive requested that is why they sent you early isnt it
doctor i
i can explain why i needed it they have no idea what my problems are there are explanations for all of it
i dont need explanations
then we have nothing further to say to each other
ill tell my captain to expect your grievance
do that
riker to enterprise im ready to leave now
stand by commander engaging transport
freeze programme then i returned to the enterprise
and you have nothing further to add commander nothing about firing a phaser
i never fired a phaser on the science station
thats odd very odd captain picard is it not true that your sensors detected an energy drain just as commander riker began transport
thats correct
have you been able to explain it
not to my knowledge
we have our readings are quite clear about it information retrieved from the labs ground computers indicate that a focused energy pulse was fired just as commander riker began transport furthermore by analysing the angle and trajectory we have determined that it came from the very spot commander riker was standing so then will you allow me to show you my recreation of the end of this story a speculation if you will computer run hypothetical krag one

riker to enterprise im ready to leave now
stand by commander engaging transport

freeze programme three seconds later the station exploded

the tanugans are right something was fired at the reactor core just before transport
the energy signature would seem to indicate a phaserlike blast
well it wasnt the commanders phaser it couldnt have been theres another answer were just not seeing it
was there anything else in the lab capable of creating this kind of energy discharge
not that i saw besides how do you account for the fact that it came from commanders rikers exact position damn it i should have stayed with him
commander sensors indicate a radiation burst on deck thirty nine outside cargo bay twelve
source
unknown sir
computer identify type of radiation
emission is not consistent with any known radiation
it is subsiding sir


what kind of radiation could do this make any sense to you
i dont recognise it not even the main deflector puts out that kind of spillage
where would it be coming from
i dont know wes but whatever it is its capable of putting a hole in solid duranium


in a sense we have already met mrs apgar so we shall dispense with introductions
mrs apgar you understand the purpose of this hearing
we understand how difficult this will be for you if you need a recess please dont hesitate to ask
would you like to make a statement before we begin
no i just know he did it he killed my husband
computer load manua simulation one

run programme
if you greet them with such a long face theyre going to assume something is wrong with the experiment
i just need time a little more time
im certain theyll give you the time you need if you just show a little charm
you do that so much better than i do  manua someday ill be able to reward you for all your patience ill get you everything you ever dreamed of
i have all the reward i need now go on ill be right in

doctor apgar

im commander william riker lieutenant commander geordi la forge
my assistant tayna well lets get on with it shall we
dont be in such a hurry dear perhaps our guests would like some refreshment
my wife manua
its a pleasure to meet you manua
im anxious to get started
if you wish
i must say i resent your early arrival commander i have much work to do
doctor ill do everything in my power to make this as painless as possible for both of us do you assist your husband in his work
oh dear no im no scientist
no neither am i
but i find this all fascinating dont you
mister la forge why dont you take a look at the doctors experimental data later you can give me an overview
fine whatever starfleet will get its krieger wave converter these things take time ive had a few setbacks thats all
doctor im not trying to put any pressure on you im sure my report will only underscore the need for continued support of your research
tayna ill call up the records show the commanders assistant whatever he wants to see
yes doctor if youll come with me our field generator is on the planet since it requires a minimum of five thousand kilometres for the field to collimate
darling let tayna take care of that im sure commander riker wants to hear how close you are to a breakthrough ill pour the two of you a drink and you can talk all about krieger waves

 commander
to success
success
well in a way i suppose its good that youre early manuas right it gives me a chance to show you the progress weve been making
id appreciate it if commander la forge and i could stay here until the enterprise returns

its a little inconvenient
it would help to accelerate the process
well if you wish commander now where shall i start well first of all you should know that i am very close to being able to collimate a krieger field

our guest quarters are very modest
very charming it has your touch
the station is small and we dont often have guests i use this as my sanctuary
who do you need sanctuary from
the environmental controls are here

commander please its late and im tired
a man more interested in krieger waves than in a lovely woman like you how is that possible
my husband is one of the great minds in the galaxy and we love each other very much

please dont
it must be very lonely a princess in a very high tower
please my husband will be looking for me
your sanctuary remember

commander dont please
 shes lying that never happened
freeze programme
please

captain you know i would never act like that
commander riker
this isnt me i wasnt the one who closed the door i didnt proposition her and i certainly didnt try to rape her why are you doing this
 its exactly what happened
will come on sit down
resume programme
please

i knew youd try this riker do you think i didnt notice how you looked at her im not the fool you take me for

you wont get away with this your career is over ill see to it i swear i will riker
if you report this youll be making a terrible mistake doctor a terrible mistake

freeze programme
your career was safe he was a scientist in another day some fascinating bit of technical trivia would have distracted him he would have forgotten about you and his complaint to starfleet excuse me

well um well take a short recess

why would she lie like that she was lying you could tell
will i didnt sense any deception from her
then you think that i
no no of course not i know you you dont have to convince me of anything
we cant both be telling the truth
it is the truth as each of you remembers it
but her version puts a noose around my neck

this is healing beautifully i think you can work on strengthening these muscles again
security to doctor crusher evacuate repeat evacuate radiation emissions are indicated in sickbay

it is definitely the same radiation that penetrated deck thirty nine highly focused very powerful but of unknown origin
if this should happen in the engine core or the antimatter containment tanks well be in big trouble captain
do you have any theories
captain datas noticed something thats too strange to be a coincidence
the two radiation events aboard the enterprise occurred five hours twenty minutes and three seconds apart the science station exploded yesterday at almost four times that interval
theres a point zero zero one four second variance we havent been able to explain yet
so youre saying theres a connection between the radiation bursts and the explosion
we do not have the evidence to support that conclusion at this time commander
if theyre right we should be able to predict the next event
were expecting it in just over five hours
take every precaution to protect the ships vital areas if we havent identified the source before the time interval well leave orbit if you perceive any further danger advise me immediately

well figure it out for you commander

after the fight doctor apgar came to find me he was very upset
and he told you what happened
yes he told me everything that happened
based on taynas deposition we have recreated the incident in commander rikers quarters as doctor apgar described it to her computer
inspector inspector this is hearsay she wasnt a witness to this incident
but doctor apgar is dead her statement is admissible according tanugan law and i insist you consider it
well well watch this evidence and well weigh it accordingly
computer run tayna simulation three


i knew id find the two of you together do you think i didnt notice how you were looking at each other im not the fool you take me for

im going to report this riker you can count on that
youre a dead man apgar a dead man
freeze programme and then doctor apgar came to find you
yes
run tayna simulation four

i want you to take manua and beam down to tanuga immediately
but doctor if he threatened you you shouldnt stay
im not leaving him here alone hes capable of anything ive got to protect our work
ill contact the authorities
no ill take care of that
doctor be careful
itll be all right go on
freeze programme then what happened
i left the station with manua the next day when i heard the station had exploded i knew what had happened hed killed doctor apgar
thank you you are excused

captain i have established motive method and opportunity in any court in the federation that is sufficient to warrant the extradition of the accused i await your decision forthwith

i dont see any alternative do you
we both know wills innocent
of course hes innocent but as a starfleet captain i cant allow myself the luxury of yielding to my personal feelings the evidence warrants a trial ill have to allow extradition
do you think theres enough evidence to prove his innocence
no
captain i believe we have found the source of the radiation can you join us on the bridge
acknowledged

as you know captain we are looking for a phenomenon that reoccurs every five hours twenty minutes and three seconds
the interval between radiation bursts
we have found one such phenomenon on the planets surface
its the field generator that apgar during in his research when its fully charged it automatically emits an energy pulse and then takes five hours twenty minutes and three seconds to recharge itself
it must have been left on after the explosion of the lab
but why would a generator be affecting the enterprise this way
it should not be it is a harmless lambda field generator
but we knew that somehow it was related to our radiation bursts and then the pieces started just falling together
we now know what is causing the bursts and why the science station exploded sir
and we also know who killed doctor apgar

chief inspector weve watched the events replayed over and over again and i am impressed and admittedly dismayed by the body of evidence against commander riker but isnt it remarkable that with all the witnesses all the different points of view of the events aboard the space station we havent seen what really happened
i do not understand
allow me with the help of mister la forge to explain computer load manua programme one time index fourteen four one play programme
fine whatever starfleet will get its krieger wave converter these things take time ive had a few setbacks thats all
freeze mrs apgar this was from your deposition it would seem to suggest that your husband had failed to create krieger waves
yes but he was very close to a breakthrough
he said he needed more time he was upset by our early arrival but in fact i maintain he already had made that breakthrough and that he was lying to us
on what basis
for the last several hours the enterprise has been experiencing unusual radiation bursts weve identified them as krieger waves
krieger waves but thats impossible from where
from right here inside the holodeck
we recreated your science lab in every conceivable detail essentially what was in the original lab is here
including the krieger wave converter that doctor apgar claimed didnt work except it does work
your field generator on the planet surface has been sending out harmless energy charges which this facsimile has been converting into krieger waves
but the holodeck cant create anything dangerous
well it didnt when you get down to basics the converter is nothing more than a complex series of mirrors and reflective coils the energy from the field generator down on the planet simply reflects off of elements in the convertor which turns it into highly focused krieger waves
and those same waves have been randomly striking different areas of our ship as we orbit the planet and our angle to the generator changes
why would apgar lie about his success
computer run manua programme one time code fourteen three eight

manua someday ill be able reward you for all your patience ill get you everything you ever dreamed of
i have all the reward i need
freeze programme run riker programme two time code sixteen one zero
to your success doctor
and the rewards that come with it
freeze
i never said that
nevertheless it seems clear that your husband was motivated to earn the kind of rewards that pleased you mrs apgar
whats wrong with that
well he wouldnt have earned great profits from his dealings with starfleet we were only interested in a new power source
but if he could turn this into a weapon it would be worth a lot to the romulans the ferengi and a few others now doctor apgar had been ordering extra dicosilium for months thats a pretty good indication that he was trying to create larger reflective coils
and when the away team arrived early he must have been worried that starfleet was becoming suspicious he needed more time to finish his work apgar said that each of the three versions no doubt he was afraid that commander riker might learn the truth and cut off his support prematurely discovering commander riker with his wife didnt help matters i submit that he decided to murder commander riker
ridiculous
is it computer run tayna programme four time index eighteen one four

ill contact the authorities
no ill take care of that
freeze

tayna exactly is apgar doing here
activating the generator on the planet
why would he do that
maybe he was going to work on the converter i dont know
maybe he was already thinking ahead to his next confrontation with commander riker computer play riker programme four time index twenty four one
what are you going to put in your report riker that theres no justification for all the extra dicosilium ive requested that is why they sent you early isnt it
doctor
i can explain why i needed it they have no idea what my problems are there are explanations for all of it
i dont need explanations
freeze to apgar this must have seemed as though commander riker were confirming his worst fears and i believe it was now that he decided finally to kill him
you forget picard we know the energy pulse which blew up the reactor originated from commander rikers position not doctor apgars
we are hypothesising that doctor apgar energised the converter at the moment of commander rikers beamout hoping to make his death look like a transporter accident but something went wrong the energy pulse hit the transporter beam and reflected back to the reactor which caused the explosion
an interesting hypothesis but impossible to prove
not really we know that the field generator on the planet has been repeating a discharge ever since the explosion the intervals are like clockwork except the explosion occurred point zero zero one four seconds after the initial discharge and the only explanation for that variance is the time it would take the energy pulse to bounce back from the transporter beam to the reactor
weve arranged a demonstration to illustrate mister la forge i think its about time isnt it
computer load programme la forge one coordinate autoengage time sequence the next discharge from the field generator is scheduled to occur in just a few moments and weve aligned the holodeck programme to recreate the final events as commander riker described them only this time our facsimile will automatically process the energy charge from the planet and reflect it just as the original convertor did before the explosion
if were correct well know it instantly
autoengage time sequence synchronised
then we have nothing further to say to each other
ill tell my captain to expect your grievance
do that
riker to enterprise im ready to leave now
stand by commander engaging transport



doctor apgar killed himself during his attempt to kill commander riker
based on this new evidence i withdraw my request for commander rikers extradition commander my apologies

number one have we any further business in the tanuga system
not that i know of id be more than willing to put it behind me
then perhaps you would do me the pleasure of getting this ship underway

lieutenant worf report to the bridge
on my way

no

analysis mister data
sensors are reading gravimetric fluctuations captain most unusual ones
unusual in what way specify
nothing i have seen before
is it a wormhole
yes and no like a time displacement but it does not have a discernible event horizon
sir navigational subsystems are unable to give coordinates on the object
confirmed the phenomenon does not have a definable centre or outer edge
are you saying it is and yet it isnt there
i do not have sufficient information to make an analysis as yet commander the dynamics of the radiation patterns
captain somethings happening a new change in sensor readings

mister data
scanning sensors

lieutenant what are their sensor readings is that an enemy vessel
im getting too much interference captain


now hear this fleet formation briefing in main war room at fifteen hundred hours doctor joshua campbell report to station ops ensign toms please forward combat information ensign thomas to cic
this isnt right its changed

its clearing now captain definitely federation starship accessing registry
looks like they had a rough ride
ncc one seven oh one c uss enterprise
military log combat date  while investigating an unusual radiation anomaly the enterprise has encountered what could almost be called a ghost from its own past the enterprisec the immediate predecessor to this battleship


sensors confirm design and specifications captain analysis of hull and engine materials conform to engineering patterns and methods of that time period
 but that cruiser was destroyed with all hands over twenty years ago
presumed destroyed the enterprise c was last seen near the klingon outpost narendra three exactly twenty two years three months and four days ago
and now theyre here
has it been adrift for all those years or has it has travelled through time
it is a possibility captain if that hypothesis is correct the phenomenon we just encountered would be a temporal rift in space
a rift
possibly the formation of a kerr loop from superstring material it would require highenergy interactions occurring in the vicinity for such a structure to be formed the rift is certainly not stable captain it could collapse at any time
captain im able to scan the interior of the ship now sir heavy damage to warp field nacelles and hull bearing struts internal space frame is lifesigns captain readings are sporadic it looks like they have massive casualties but some are still alive
bridge to sickbay emergency teams stand by transporter rooms
understood
belay that order doctor
respectfully if i may suggest regardless of where they came from they are here now and they need our help
commander if that ship has travelled into the future we could be dealing with variables that will alter the flow of our history
enterprise c is sending out a distress call sir audio only
this is captain garrett of the starship enterprise to any federation ship we have been attacked by romulan warships and require immediate assistance weve lost warp drive life support is failing
theres no record of the romulans ever assaulting the enterprise c
voice message has ended captain im only receiving their automated distress signal now
open a hailing frequency this is captain jeanluc picard of the federation of a federation starship standby to receive emergency teams commander we will handle this one step at a time stabilise their power systems and tend to their injured and avoid all discussions of where and when they are
aye sir lieutenant

aye sir all decks report condition yellow


captain garrett
yes
im commander william riker our emergency teams are on board your ship doctor
the rest of the bridge crew is dead she has a bad fracture and has serious internal injuries im going to have to get her back to the enterprise
to where
well explain that later
youll explain now commander
were from a federation starship we answered your distress call your ship is in good hands but we need to get you to our sickbay
very well
crusher to transporter room two to beam directly to sickbay
stand by for transport

its pretty bad commander looks like they were in a hell of a fight
if you cant stabilise the life support were going to have to evacuate the ship
i think we can do it ill have to get to engineering though la forge to damage control team alpha meet me on engineering level three
commander

thanks

weve stabilised life support mister la forge is working on restoring the main power couplings but thatll take time its a real mess down here sir
survivors
one hundred twenty five
recommendation
id hate to have to scrap her starfleet could certainly use another ship even if she is old
agreed but we cant stay in this area too long you have nine hours if you can get her underway by then well escort her back to starbase one oh five if not well evacuate the survivors and destroy the ship
understood sir
keep me posted picard out

we need to talk somehow this this is all wrong this is not the way its supposed to be

you must have some idea how things have changed
i look at things i look at people and they just dont feel right
what things what people
you your uniform the bridge
whats the matter with the bridge
its not right
its the same bridge nothing has changed
i know that i also know its wrong
what else
families there should be children on this ship
what children on the enterprise guinan were at war
no were not at least were not supposed to be this is not a ship of war this a ship of peace
what youre suggesting
im not suggesting that ship from the past is not supposed to be here its got to go back

run a full electrolyte report boost the level of tricordrazine try to relax
doctor selar report to pathology ward stat doctor selar report to pathology ward stat
im captain jeanluc picard
rachel garrett hows my ship
the support systems are being restored were continuing repairs
where did you come from we werent picking up any other federation ships in this sector
whats the last thing you remember
we were answering the distress signal
distress signal
you must have heard it from the klingon outpost narendra three but you didnt did you this sickbay ive never seen like it even on a starbase and your uniform what ship is this captain
please try to be still
i must insist what ship
you are aboard the enterprise captain one seven oh one d you have come twenty two years into the future
twenty two years does my crew know yet
no
i must tell them i owe them that
if you wish i can see that theyre informed
is there some reason they should not be told
i am concerned that if you return to your own time with knowledge of the future
return to the battle we barely escaped with our lives if we returned wed be destroyed
have you any idea how this happened
there was a fierce volley of photon torpedoes we were hit a bright light and then here
it is possible that this exchange of fire was the catalyst for the formation of a temporal rift history has no record of your battle with the romulans
we were responding to a distress call from the klingon outpost on narendra three the romulans were attacking it we engaged them but there were four warbirds
the narendra three outpost was destroyed it is regrettable that you did not succeed a federation starship rescuing a klingon outpost might have averted twenty years of war

i just cant quite make myself believe it twenty two years
im reading forty percent on forward shields what do you have on aft
forty percent
that wont cut it commander advise lieutenant la forge that shields are below minimum
acknowledged
well never see our homes again our families
how do you know your familys not still alive
youre right i dont but imagine coming home after twentytwo years would i even recognise them
what are the stats on main phaser banks
emitters available sixty percent forward fifty two percent aft
good lets take a look at the torpedo launchers
i guess im lucky to be alive at all
you may not like the future its been a long war the federation has lost more than half of starfleet to the klingons
we were negotiating a peace treaty when i left
a lot of changes lieutenant a lot of changes
when we get a break maybe you could fill me in on some of them
photon banks are depleted auxiliary fusion generators are down

there is a high degree of probability that the temporal rift is symmetrical captain
then what would happen if the enterprise c were to fly back through it
back sir the enterprise c would emerge in her own time period at almost the same instant she left
right in the middle of the battle with the romulans
yes sir
is there any possibility she could survive data none sir
then sending them back would be a death sentence

lieutenant barrett to communications
she was the first galaxy class warship built by the federation forty two decks capable of transporting over six thousand troops
how long have you been on board
four years straight out of the academy i was lucky to get the enterprise
yeah me too i mean my enterprise

triage team to main shuttlebay
lieutenant hows the ship
weve restored minimal shields and the forward phaser banks still no photon launchers or warp drive
concentrate on the weapon systems from what captain picard told me the federation can use all the help it can get
and soon our sensors have picked up klingon warships in this sector captain
why wasnt i informed mister castillo
captain you shouldnt
as senior officer i want you to be my liaison to the enterprised coordinate with tactical
thats me captain
where do you think youre going
im resuming my duties doctor
captain you need at least another twenty four hours
nonsense doctors always overprotect their patients
and captains always push themselves too hard
doctor my ship and crew need me now twenty four hours might as well be twenty four years

i need more
there is no more i wish there were i wish i could prove it but i cant
then i cant ask them to go back
youve got to
guinan they will die moments after they return how can i ask them to sacrifice themselves based solely on your intuition
i dont know but i do know that this is a mistake every fibre in my being says this is a mistake i cant explain it to myself so i cant explain it to you i only know that im right
who is to say that this history is any less proper than the other
i suppose i am
not good enough damn it not good enough i will not ask them to die
forty billion people have already died this wars not supposed to be happening youve got to send those people back to correct this
and what is to guarantee that if they go back they will succeed every instinct tells me this is wrong it is dangerous it is futile
weve known each other a long time you have never known me to impose myself on anyone or take a stance based on trivial or whimsical perceptions this time line must not be allowed to continue now ive told you what you must do you have only your trust in me to help you decide to do it


deflector shield technology has advanced considerably during the war our heat dissipation rates are probably double those of the enterprisec which means we can hang in a firefight a lot longer guinan
have you ordered yet tasha
no not yet is anything wrong
not a thing what can i get for you
just a couple of tkls were in a hurry oh this is lieutenant castillo

first time for everything
first time
its just that ive never seen anything bother her before
whats a tkl
standard rations food replicators are on minimum power so everything else is diverted to defensive systems so where was i
youve told me more about tactical in an hour than i learned my last year in the academy
youre going to need it lieutenant
hey ive known you a whole day now lieutenant i wont salute if you wont what did she call you tasha
yeah
most everybody just calls me castillo my mother calls me richard
okay castillo
no i think maybe id like it better if you called me richard
richard
this is the captain senior officers will report to my ready room immediately
so much for lunch

captain are you suggesting that we let them return and attempt to complete their mission
i am doctor
based on guinans intuition
that wont accomplish anything sir theres no way they can save narendra three
captain garrett says there were four romulan warbirds the enterprisec would be outmanned and outgunned
unless we were to rearm them with modern
we cant do that if we send that ship back with new technology we will be altering the past
but thats what youre talking about anyway isnt it altering the past
were talking about restoring the past
how could guinan know that history has been altered if shes been altered along with the rest of us
perhaps her species has a perception that goes beyond linear time
there are many things about her species we cant easily explained yet it is very possible she is correct a ship from the past has travelled through time how can we know what effect those events will have on the present indeed we shall never know for certain if guinan is correct but i have decided the consequences of that possibility are too grave to ignore dismissed
sir if youd like my opinion
i think im aware of your opinion commander this is a briefing im not seeking your consent
with all due respect sir youd be asking one hundred and twenty five people to die a meaningless death
not necessarily meaningless commander the klingons regard honour above all else if the crew of the enterprisec had died fighting for the survival of a klingon outpost it would be considered a meaningful act of honour by the klingon empire
even their deaths might have prevented this war if the enterprisec returns to the battle and its mission is a success history will be irrevocably changed this time line will cease to exist and a new future will have been created ive considered the alternatives ill go with guinans recommendation dismissed

if shes right we may not even be in an alternate time line
yeah who knows if were dead or alive

engineering is engineering your destination as well
what oh deck six sorry
if i interpret your facial expressions correctly you are preoccupied with something unpleasant
no i was just thinking about a lot of things ive been working with one of the officers on the enterprisec hes nice i like him im worried about whats going to happen to him
we may never know what happens if they succeed we will not even realise that these events occurred

shields are up to seventy two percent thats better
good
do you believe this guinan
i discovered long ago that she has a special wisdom ive learned to trust it i could arrange for you to speak with her if you wish
captain i would be lying to you if i told you there was a chance in hell of coming out of this alive why doesnt your ship come back with us the romulans would be no match for your weaponry
i cant do that
no i suppose not you dont belong in our time any more than we belong in yours to be honest picard a significant number of my crewmembers have expressed a desire to return even knowing the odds some because they cant bear to live without their loved ones some because they dont like the idea of slipping out in the middle of a fight but i have told them that in the here and now the federation needs another ship against the klingons and wed better get used to being in the here and now
but if you go back it could be a great deal more helpful the war is going very badly for the federation far worse than is generally known starfleet command believes defeat is inevitable within six months we may have no choice but to surrender
and youre saying all this may be a result of our arrival here
one more ship will make no difference in the here and now but twenty two years ago one ship could have stopped this war before it started
mister castillo
yes captain
inform the crew were going back
yes captain
the romulans will get a good fight well make it one for the history books
i know you will captain lieutenant yar
permission to remain for a moment sir
granted
transporter room captain picard is ready to return to his ship
aye captain
i just wanted to say good luck
ill try to put some of your tactical briefing to good use when we get back
your ship has much more manoeuvrability than the romulan counterparts of that era actually if you could just isolate youll do fine
if you get back to earth and you see a man say in his late fifties taking a hard look across a crowded room hey you never know
goodbye lieutenant

captain garrett
this is lieutenant yar sir captain garrett is dead

im prepared to lead the enterprise back myself captain picard
sir lieutenant castillo is the last surviving senior officer he will have limited support from ops no tactical reduced staff in engineering
i have good people willing to do their best
certainly history never meant for this ship to go into battle without her captain
i cant speak to that point sir but i can get us back to where were supposed to be i believe thats what captain garrett would want me to do
commander data to captain picard
go ahead
sir sensors are showing additional instability in the time rift possibly the result of the battle with the klingons
any signs of other klingon vessels
no sir
our coordinates have been transmitted to the klingon command sir we mustnt remain here
sir it is my intention to return unless you order me not to
how soon can your ship be ready
we sustained moderate damage in the attack i think we can get underway in a few hours
make it so well give you cover

one to beam to the enterprisec we keep saying goodbye dont we
i wish there was more time
more time i think we have all the time we can handle as it is

lieutenant

can i get you something tasha
guinan i have to know something what happens to me in the other time line
i dont have alternate biographies of the crew as i said to the captain its just a feeling
but theres something more when you look at me isnt there i can see it in your eyes guinan weve known each other too long
we werent meant to know each other at all at least thats what i sense when i look at you tasha youre not supposed to be here
where am i supposed to be
dead
do you know how
no but i do know it was an empty death a death without purpose

come yes lieutenant
captain i request a transfer to the enterprisec
for what reason
they need someone at tactical
we need you here
im not supposed to be here sir
sit down lieutenant what did she say to you
i dont belong here sir im supposed to be dead
she felt it necessary to reveal that to you
i felt it was necessary
i see you realise that it is very possible the enterprisec will fail we will continue in this time line in which case your life hopefully will continue for a long while
i know how important it is that they dont fail captain thats why im requesting this transfer
you dont belong on that ship lieutenant
no captain garrett belongs on that ship but shes dead and i think theres a certain logic in this request
theres no logic in this at all whether they succeed or not the enterprisec will be destroyed
but captain at least with someone at tactical they will have a chance to defend themselves well it may be a matter of seconds or minutes but those could be the minutes that change history guinan says i died a senseless death in the other time line i didnt like the sound of that captain ive always known the risks that come with a starfleet uniform if im to die in one id like my death to count for something
lieutenant permission granted
thank you sir

im showing phaser banks up to seventy percent efficiency weve got an hour left lets see if we can get them up to ninety
aye sir
parker youve got ops fredericks take the conn
ill handle tactical lieutenant tasha yar reporting for duty sir
youre not part of my crew
i am now captain picard approved my request for transfer
this isnt a joke tasha were going back in the rift into battle were not coming back
i know the mission these are my orders lieutenant
but i dont want you here
you need me here show me someone on your crew who can do the job better than i can
welcome aboard take your station lieutenant
aye sir
military log supplemental lieutenant tasha yar has transferred to the enterprisec where she has taken over tactical duties meanwhile our long range scanners have picked up klingon battle cruisers on an intercept course

number and type of ships mister crusher
three kvort class battlecruisers sir
theyre not even troubling to cloak themselves
they shouldnt be so confident after the pasting we gave them on archer four
attention all hands as you know we could outrun the klingon vessels but we must protect the enterprisec until she enters the temporal rift and we must succeed lets make sure history never forgets the name enterprise picard out

the phenomenon is closing in on itself captain
very well prepare a class one sensor probe well leave it behind to monitor the final closure mister crusher lay in a course for archer four
captain this is guinan is everything all right up there
guinan yes everythings fine is something wrong

no no everythings fine sorry to bother you

geordi tell me about tasha yar
the offspring

captains log stardate  while commander riker is away on personal leave the enterprise has travelled to sector three nine six to begin charting the selebi asteroid belt

he sent for you too
yes he was very mysterious
does you have any idea what this is about
something happened at that cybernetics conference since hes come back hes spent every off duty minute in that lab
its not like data to be so secretive
and cautious he kept the lab locked every minute
now how would you know that ah ha

oh you are early just a moment please



you may enter now
come on data what is this
yeah data whats going on
i have invited you here to meet someone

this is lal lal say hello to counsellor deanna troi
hello counsellor deanna troi
how do you do lal
i am functioning within normal parameters
lal this is geordi la forge
purpose for exterior drapings father
 father
it is an accepted custom that we wear clothing
data it called you father
yes wesley lal is my child
captains log supplemental i have just been advised of a highly unusual project undertaken by commander data

lal has a positronic brain one very similar to my own i began programming it at the cybernetics conference
but nobodys ever been able to do that data at least not since you were programmed
true but here was a new submicron matrix transfer technology introduced at the conference which i discovered could be used to lay down complex neural net pathways
so you did a transfer from your brain into lals
exactly wesley i realised for the first time it was possible to continue doctor soongs work my initial transfers produced very encouraging results so i brought lals brain back with me
data i would like to have been consulted
i have not observed anyone else on board consulting you about their procreation captain
why didnt you give it a more human look data
i decided to allow my child to choose its own sex and appearance
commander data at your convenience i would like to talk to you in my ready room counsellor

i insist we do whatever we can to discourage the perception of this new android as a child it is not a child it is an invention albeit an extraordinary one
why should biology rather than technology determine whether it is a child data has created an offspring a new life out of his own being to me that suggests a child if he wishes to call lal his child then who are we to argue
well if he must but i fail to understand how a five foot android with heuristic learning systems and the strength of a ten men can be called a child
youve never been a parent

what you have done will have serious ramifications i am truly dismayed that you told no one of what you were doing
i am sorry captain i did not anticipate your objections do you wish me to deactivate lal
its a life data it cant be activated and deactivated simply this is a most stupendous undertaking have you any idea what will happen when starfleet learns about this
i have followed all of starfleet regulations to the best of my ability i expected they would be pleased
well you have taken on quite a responsibility data
to prepare i have scanned all available literature on parenting there seems to be much confusion on this issue one traditional doctrine insists spare the rod and spoil the child suggesting a punitive approach while another more liberal attitude would allow the child enormous freedom
data
and what klingons do to their children
data im not talking about parenting i am talking about the extraordinary consequences of creating new life
does that not describe becoming a parent sir
data you are seeking to achieve what only your own creator has been able to achieve to make another functioning sentient android to make another data
that is why i must attempt this sir i have observed that in most species there is a primal instinct to perpetuate themselves until now i have been the last of my kind if i were to be damaged or destroyed i would be lost forever but if i am successful with the creation of lal my continuance is assured i understand the risk sir and i am prepared to accept the responsibility

gender female
thats right lal just like me
gender male
correct
i am gender neuter inadequate
that is why you must choose a gender lal to complete your appearance
what are criteria
access your data bank on sexuality level two that will define the parameters
whatever you choose will be yours for your lifetime its a decision that will affect how people interrelate with you
i choose your sex and appearance
no lal that would be confusing we are taking you to the holodeck to show you several thousand composites i have programmed you may choose from them
several thousand
this is a big decision


counsellor lal has narrowed the choices to four would you like to see
yes yes of course data
computer lal gender sequence finalists begin an andorian female
interesting youll be the only one on board the enterprise lal
that could make socialisation more difficult a human male
very attractive theres no problem with socialisation here
a human female
i like her
a klingon male
a friend for worf theyre all very interesting do you have a favourite
yes i have chosen

i have completed the assembly of the replicated anatomy i was able to provide lal with more realistic skin and eye colour than my own

congratulations data its a girl

this is home lal
home place of residence social unit formed by a family living together
yes we are a family lal chair to sit in sit good painting
painting colours produced on a surface by applying a pigment
yes i will teach you to recognise the artistry in paintings

soft
yes very good lal you have correctly processed the sense of touch there are many fascinating experiences i wish to share with you
painting
no that is a flower lal inhale
smell
yes
show me more father
second officers science log supplemental training in social skills at the most elementary level has begun lal is progressing very slowly but is not deterred by early setbacks while motor coordination has improved twelve percent reflexes still need to develop visual comprehension is especially difficult for lal translating her vast data banks into recognisable applications may improve with additional transfers she is also learning to supplement her innate android behaviour with simulated human responses and it is interesting to note that as i observe lal learning about her world i share in her experience almost as though i am learning things over again


the transfer itself is fairly simple each neural pathway in my brain is duplicated precisely in hers theoretically the duplicate brains should be able to store and process the same information but until all of the transfers are complete we will not know for certain
what does lal do while youre on duty
she studies in our quarters she requires very little supervision lal is quite selfsufficient
have you considered sending her to school
she already has access to the sum of human knowledge from me
data she could learn a lot by being with kids her own age
she is only two weeks old
okay close to her own age
doctor crusher to ensign crusher arent you supposed to be getting a hair cut wesley
im on my way parents nothing personal

lal the third crosslink transfer series is complete
father what is my purpose
purpose
my function my reason for being
that is a complex question lal i can only begin to answer by telling you that our function is to contribute in a positive way to the world in which we live
why am i me instead of someone else
because you are my child
where did i come from
these questions suggest that we have made a successful transfer of the heuristic associative pathways you will now begin to process information on logic aesthetics metaphysics and epistemology you are truly becoming sentient lal
how
by developing the awareness to examine and question your perceptions
why do we have two hands why not three or four why is the sky black why do

tomorrow will be your first day of school lal

i assure you admiral theres no better guide into this life for lal than data hes doing an excellent job
we all have enormous admiration for what commander data has already achieved but we have superior facilities and personnel here at galor four a starship is hardly a proper setting
this starships mission is to seek out new life and that is exactly what commander data is doing under my guidance
we all want whats best for the new android
as do i i would be willing to consider releasing lal and data to you so that he may continue his work with her
his presence would undoubtedly retard the new androids progress
admiral to you lal is a new android but to data shes his child
his child
yes admiral it may not be easy for you and i to see her that way but he does and i respect that they will remain here for now
starfleets policy on research is clear youre making your stand on very uncertain ground i do hope it doesnt fall out from under you haftel out

she achieved a very high score on a test of academic achievement
a perfect score
yes which is why we started her out with the older children but lal couldnt understand the nuances of how they related to each other
i see
we decided the best thing to do would be to put her with younger children
that would seem to be reasonable
it isnt working out that way

the children were afraid of her

father what is the significance of laughter
it is a human physiological response to humour
then judging from their laughter the children at school found my remarks humorous so without understanding humour i have somehow mastered it
deck fifteen lal
yes father
the children were not laughing with you they were laughing at you
explain
one is meant kindly the other is not
why would they wish to be unkind
because you are different differences sometimes scare people i have learned that some of them use humour to hide their fear
i do not want to be different

doctor i require your advice as a successful parent
well thank you data id like to think i was well please sit down hows lal
lal is realising she is not the same as other children
is it lonely for her
she does not feel the emotion of loneliness but she can observe how isolated she is from the others she wishes to be more like them i do not know how to help her lal is passing into sentience it is perhaps the most difficult stage of her development
when wesley was growing up he was an extraordinarily bright boy but he had a hard time making friends i think the other children were a little intimidated by him
that is precisely what happened to lal in school how did you help him
well first i went back to my own childhood and remembered how painful it was for me because i remember a time when i wasnt very popular either and when i told that to wesley it made him feel a little better he knew i understood what he was going through
i have not told lal how difficult it was for me to assimilate i did not wish it to discourage her perhaps this was an error of judgement
you didnt have any one experienced to help you through sentience she at least has you just help her realise that shes not alone and be there to nurture her when she needs love and attention
i can give her attention doctor but i am incapable of giving her love

now why do i find that so hard to believe


captain incoming signal starfleet priority one admiral haftel
on my monitor lieutenant admiral
captain picard i hope i didnt disturb you
not at all
i have discussed my concerns with starfleet command you are to hold your position until i join you then i shall personally review the androids development
understood
i should advise you captain that if im not satisfied with what i see i am empowered to take the android back with me haftel out
captains log supplemental we are holding position pending the arrival of admiral haftel from starfleet research commander data is completing his final neural transfers to the android he has named lal which i have learned in the language hindi means beloved

hello data
guinan

lal how are you
i am functioning within normal i am fine thank you
good
guinan lal needs to observe human behaviour
shes in the right place for it
and for this opportunity she is willing to provide services to assist you
father says i would learn a great deal from working with someone as old as you
youre hired the most important part about working some place like this is the art listening i have some expertise so i shall teach you
that would be most beneficial
ive been programmed with a listing of fourteen hundred and twelve known beverages
what did you say
ive been programmed with a listing of fourteen hundred
ive
you have used a verbal contraction
you said ive instead of i have
it is a skill my programme has never mastered
then i will desist
no you have exceeded my abilities i do not object but i do not understand how this has occurred
picard to commander data please report to my ready room
aye sir

i am certain the admiral is anxious to meet lal i have been sending him regular status reports on her development
his visit is not just an inspection of lals progress he has expressed a concern for her environment
her environment sir
he believes the daystrom annex on galor four would be more suitable
then he wishes to relocate us
not you data just her
i would not be in favour of that sir there are many things that she can learn only from me my lifetime of experiences the mistakes i have made and what i have learned from them
captain commander rikers shuttle has just returned
acknowledged lieutenant will you advise commander riker i will meet with him in one hour picard out the admiral is taking the position that lals development should be overseen by the most experienced personnel
then he is questioning my ability as a parent
in a manner of speaking
does the admiral have children
yes i believe he does data why
i am forced to wonder how much experience he had as a parent when his first child was born


you see
what are they doing
its called flirting
they seem to be communicating telepathically
theyre both thinking the same thing if thats what you mean
guinan is the joining of hands a symbolic act for humans
it shows affection humans like to touch each other they start with the hands and go from there
hes biting that female
no hes not biting theyre pressing lips its called kissing
why are they leaving
lal there are some things your fathers just going to have to explain to you when he thinks youre ready

youre new around here arent you
yes

lal lal put him down
commander what are your intentions toward my daughter
your daughter nice to meet you


i watch them and i can do the things they do but i will never feel the emotions ill never know love
it is a limitation we must learn to accept lal
then why do you still try to emulate humans what purpose does it serve except to remind you that you are incomplete
i have asked myself that many times as i have struggled to be more human until i realised it is the struggle itself that is most important we must strive to be more than we are lal it does not matter that we will never reach our ultimate goal the effort yields its own rewards
you are wise father
it is the difference between knowledge and experience
i learned today that humans like to hold hands it is a symbolic gesture of affection


no objective viewpoint could see it any other way
forgive me admiral i thought you were sent here to form an opinion not to justify one
captain do not make this more difficult than it needs to be
i see no need for it to be difficult at all i understand your concerns what im asking for is time patience if you have an open mind im sure you will see that it is imperative that data and lal be kept together during the formative stages of her development after that i have no doubt commander data will be delighted to deliver her to starfleet research
thats not satisfactory if mistakes are made the damage thats done might be irreparable
im convinced the damage will be irreparable if theyre separated
captain are we talking about breaking up a family isnt that rather a sentimental attitude about androids
theyre living sentient beings their rights and privileges in our society have been defined i helped define them
yes captain and i am more than willing to acknowledge that what you must acknowledge is that lal may be a technological step forward in the development of artificial intelligence
a most significant step
yes and work like this demands to be done with controlled procedures
which commander data is following
in effective isolation and that is what starfleet research finds unacceptable

so lal now possesses the sum of my programming
her neural nets are laid down identically to yours
there do seem to be some variations on the quantum level she can use contractions i cannot
an aberration what have you done about this
i have maintained records on positronic matrix activity behavioral norms and all verbal patterns i have seen no evidence of other aberrations
it would seem youve actually improved upon yourself data
is that not the goal of every parent sir
but as a good father dont you think it would be better especially in light of this new aberration if lal were close to people trained in diagnostic and evaluative procedures
i am programmed with the procedures you mention sir and in any meaningful evaluation of lal you would require a model for a basis of comparison i am the only model available admiral
you havent mastered human cultural and behavioural norms yourself yet have you
no sir
where is lal now

this is your idea of appropriate guidance
it is an opportunity for her to observe human behaviour and more importantly for her to interact with her crewmates
she is capable of running over sixty trillion calculations per second and you have her working as a cocktail waitress
admiral she is under the strict guidance of a woman in whom i have absolute trust ten forward is the centre of the ships social activity everyone on board comes here
im not convinced the sort of behaviour she observes here will be a positive influence
most people when they come here behave themselves if they dont i ask them to leave
admiral haftel guinan she runs ten forward how is lal doing
she spills a few drinks every now and then but shes learning
i want the android out of here
now admiral youve been in one or two bars in your time
have her report to me immediately for an interview

well lal ive been looking forward to meeting you
why
youre very important to us at starfleet research we have got quite a facility at galor four i want like to show it to you
in fact the admiral is fact suggesting you be moved to galor four lal
have i done something wrong
oh no of course not we just want to broaden your experience theres only so much you can learn on a starship im sure youll agree to that
yes ill agree
good
thus the natural conclusion would be when i have learned all there is to learn aboard the starship i would relocate to galor four
that is not the natural conclusion here
i believe it is
you see lal the admiral is concerned that you need more guidance than your father can provide here on the enterprise
yes dont misunderstand me i have great respect for your father
you do not speak with respect
she seems very adversarial
im merely stating a fact admiral
i dont think your father has taught you selective judgment in the verbalisation of your own thoughts that is a skill we will help you develop
my father is already helping me sir
the question is has he helped you enough
are you asking me sir
no i didnt mean to ask any
why dont we admiral in all these discussions no one has ever mentioned her wishes shes a free sentient being what are your wishes lal
i wish to remain here captain picard
thank you lal youre excused

come in

hello lal how are you
troi admiral admiral an admiral from starfleet has come to take me away troi i am scared
you are scared arent you
i feel it how is this possible
i dont know
this is what it means to feel this is what it means to feel

you have lal off to a wonderful start in life commander and thats what being a parent is all about however i have finally decided that i must ask you to release her to me
may i ask why sir
all the other arguments aside theres one that is irrefutable there are only two soongtype androids in existence it would be very dangerous to have you both in the same place especially aboard a starship one lucky shot by a romulan wed lose you both
admiral that is a fine argument but it doesnt change my feeling that the proper place for lal to develop is by datas side
youre not a parent captain i am i have learned with difficulty that there comes a time when all parents must give up their children for their own good
this is not the time damn it even i can see the umbilical cord is virtually uncut the child the child depends on him
mister data it would be better for lal if she left knowing you had voluntarily decided that this was the best course of action
admiral when i created lal it was in the hope that someday she would choose to enter the academy and become a member of starfleet i wanted to give something back in return for all starfleet has given me i still do but lal is my child you ask that i volunteer to give her up i cannot it would violate every lesson i have learned about human parenting i have brought a new life into this world and it is my duty not starfleets to guide her through these first difficult steps to maturity to support her as she learns to prepare her to be a contributing member of society no one can relieve me from that obligation and i cannot ignore it i am her father
then i regret that i must order you to transport lal aboard my ship
belay that order mister data
i beg your pardon
i will take this to starfleet myself
i am starfleet captain proceed commander
hold your ground mister data
captain you are jeopardising your command and your career
there are times sir when men of good conscience cannot blindly follow orders you acknowledge their sentience but you ignore their personal liberties and freedom order a man to hand his child over to the state not while i am his captain if you wish you can accompany us to starfleet where we shall see
troi to commander data report to your lab at once
acknowledged counsellor hes on his way is there a problem
yes captain something is terribly wrong with lal

it lasted barely a moment she experienced fear and confusion and then for no apparent reason she walked out of my quarters she didnt say another word she just started walking here and each step became more and more difficult
lal is programmed to return to the lab in the event of a malfunction
father
yes lal i am here
a malfunction emotional awareness
it appears to be a symptom of cascade failure it would require initialisation the base matrix without wiping out the higher functions
i agree may i assist
thank you admiral
if youll excuse us commander data and i have much to do



she wont survive much longer there was nothing anyone could have done wed repolarise one pathway and another would collapse and then another his hands were moving faster than i could see trying to stay ahead of each breakdown he refused to give up he was remarkable it just wasnt meant to be

lal i am unable to correct the system failure
i know
we must say goodbye now
i feel
what do you feel lal
i love you father
i wish i could feel it with you
i will feel it for both of us thank you for my life flirting laughter painting family female human

lal suffered complete neural system failure at thirteen hundred hours i have deactivated the unit
the crew is saddened by your loss mister data
i thank you for your sympathy but she is here her presence so enriched my life that i could not allow her to pass into oblivion so i incorporated her programs back into my own i have transferred her memories to me
mister data will you take your position mister crusher lay in a course for the starbase on otar two
course is set sir
engage
sins of the father

captains log stardate  as part of an exchange programme were taking aboard a klingon officer to return the recent visit of commander riker to the cruiser pagh

we must take care that while he is with us commander kurn is accorded all the rights and responsibilities due the first officer of this ship if he should feel patronised in any way
im sure wed know one does not patronise a klingon warrior
your experience on board the pagh will prove invaluable during the commanders tour be sure that the crew is prepared for any unusual orders
the klingons are very thorough im sure commander kurn has studied for his assignment just as i did when i served with them
i understand that he requested the enterprise specifically

commander kurn is ready for transport captain
energise

welcome aboard the enterprise commander im captain picard this is commander william riker he will be yielding the first officers position to you during your tour
you are relieved may i take my station captain
i thought that i might show you your quarters first
i am ready for duty sir i ask that i be allowed to take my station
very well if you will accompany us to the bridge

i am kurn commander rank klingon defence force you will address me as commander or sir at all times i am fully aware of all starfleet regulations and they will be strictly adhered to by all personnel while i am in command it is my intention to bring a sense of discipline that you may not be accustomed to with your permission of course captain
oh by all means commander
i have studied all of your service records impressive we shall see if you live up to your reputations do you wish to speak acting ensign wesley crusher
no sir commander sir
the crew awaits your orders captain
then take us to the outer cometary cloud commander
set course one one four mark two three zero one third impulse power
aye sir
execute
engaged increasing to one third impulse power sir

mind if i join you
no sir
is there something wrong wes commander kurn perhaps
he just doesnt seem to like me i cant do anything right for him every time i respond to an order he jumps down my throat i dont know what im doing wrong
problem geordi
yes sir its our new first officer
i take it he found something wrong in engineering
just the entire section he pulled a surprise inspection in the middle of a maintenance cycle i tried to explain it to him
but he wouldnt listen
were all going to be doing double shifts down there just to ready for the next inspection
his style of command is just different klingons believe in obedience and a strict formality of command
yeah but this isnt a klingon vessel hes going to have to loosen up commander
its not just us hes been leaning into everybody pretty hard except
except the one guy who wouldnt really mind it

sensors picking up asteroidal debris ahead commander
can you identify the coordinates mister worf
bearing zero zero one mark point oh three range three hundred thousand kilometres
excellent please scan the asteroid field for me lieutenant and report
approximately two thousand small objects none in our direct flight path sir
so no course correction is necessary is that what you are saying
it should not be needed sir
very good lieutenant you handled that well

yes

commander captains mess
yes
resume
your knowledge of our systems and procedures is very impressive sir i would like to make one suggestion sir
a suggestion
when i served aboard the pagh the hardest part for me was recognising and adapting to the demands of the crew they needed an iron hand i imagine it must be very difficult for you to work with a crew that is so different i would be happy to guide you in that regard if it would be helpful
no commander it wouldnt

this is not a klingon ship sir
no commander it is not if it were a klingon ship i would have killed you for offering your suggestion


how long has the bird been dead it appears to have been lying in the sun for quite some time
its not dead its been replicated you do understand that we cook most of our foods
ah yes i was told to prepare for that i shall try some of your burned replicated bird meat

i have attempted to select a menu that will allow you to sample a variety of dishes commander
try some caviar
the odour is not palatable what is it
the unhatched eggs of a large scaleless
later data a fish commander a delicacy from the caspian sea on earth its a favourite of mine our replicators never done it justice but i managed to store a few cases for special occasions
i am honoured captain

are you adjusting to your new environment commander

i find the constraints a bit difficult to conform to just a short while ago i had to stop myself from killing commander riker i believe he was trying to communicate the crews sense of discomfort with my style of command under different circumstances i would consider that a challenge to my authority
one of the aims of the exchange programme commander is for all of us to learn tolerance as for my crew it may be healthy to shake up the status quo occasionally
the commander certainly appears to have the crew on its toes
and then some no offence sir
none taken i never kill anyone at the supper table mister la forge
dont you like it commander
our food has much more taste to it while im sure this is well prepared it is far too bland for the stomach of a klingon
it seems to agree with worf
yes

enter

el
permission to speak freely sir
for what purpose
i have questions i wish to pose
are your quarters so comfortable
they serve me
this entire ship seems built on comfort relaxation being at ease it is not the ship of a warrior not the ship of a klingon you cannot ask these questions within the boundaries of protocol
they are of a personal nature sir
permission granted pose your questions
i wish to know if i have given you offence
i am not human if you had given offence you would not need to ask
perhaps i have not performed my duties to your satisfaction
i find you to be a capable starfleet officer a credit to your ship
yet you dishonour me at every opportunity
have i i did not know that being polite to a starfleet officer would bring dishonour on him
i am a klingon
really perhaps your blood has thinned in this environment i simply dont want to hurt you

mev yap so your blood is not so thin after all
i am a klingon if you doubt it a demonstration can be arranged
that is the response of a klingon the response i would expect from my older brother

i was barely a year old when you left for the khitomer outpost you our mother and father were not going to stay long it was decided that i did not need to go i was left to stay with our fathers friend lorgh until you returned you never did
the starfleet officer that rescued me was told by the klingon high command that i had no living relatives
they assumed that i was killed with the family at khitomer lorgh had no sons he took me into his family it was not until i had reached the age of ascension that i was told the truth
so you asked to serve aboard the enterprise to watch me
it was an excellent opportunity to see what kind of klingon you were or if you were klingon at all
your deception offends me brother
it should but it was required
to satisfy your curiosity
no much more you are the eldest son the challenge is yours to make
challenge
the klingon high council has judged our father a traitor to the empire

what are the allegations worf
my father is accused of aiding and abetting the romulan attack on the khitomer outpost
the attack in which he himself was killed but why now after twenty years
i do not know captain i will hear the evidence when i arrive the charge has been made by duras the son of my fathers greatest rival our family name will be disgraced for seven generations it is my responsibility to clear his name or answer for his crimes
answer for them
the family of a klingon warrior is responsible for his actions and he is responsible for theirs if i fail in my challenge i will be executed will you grant my leave captain
no if i understand correctly a starfleet officer a respected member of my crew could be accused of a capital crime your actions in this matter will reflect on this ship and on the federation therefore it seems only appropriate that your captain should be at your side while you make your challenge im sure you would do no less for me
allegiance

captains log stardate  we have finally succeeded in eradicating the phyrox plague on cor caroli five and will soon be preparing to leave orbit and proceed to our next mission a rendezvous with the uss hood to assist their terraforming efforts on browder four



commander ships sensors detect an abnormal energy reading in the captains quarters
type
undetermined
riker to captain picard
security team to captains quarters


picard to enterprise anyone receiving this transmission please respond

security override priority one

is something the matter lieutenant


its all right its al right im not going to hurt you
captain
picard of the enterprise
captain picard we studied your missions at the academy mitena haro first year cadet starfleet academy
cadet haro
perhaps you can explain what this is all about

unfortunately i cant mister
tholl kova tholl of mizar two
well mister tholl all i know is that ive been brought here against my will wherever here is
the same thing happened to me sir i was alone studying and i fainted when i came to it was about three days ago
and you sir
ive been here twelve days possibly more i had been meditating privately and for no reason whatever i lost consciousness
what can you tell me about our captors
nothing theyve never shown themselves
four sleeping areas that implies we may be joined by another captive

its edible but i wouldnt call it food

i wouldnt touch that
why not
if its the door lock the combinations too complex to hit at random i tried it and was punished
punished how
severe pain some sort of energy beam i wont get near that panel again

sir the hood has arrived at the rendezvous point they are expecting us in thirty six hours
thank you lieutenant mister data the nearest pulsar is in the lonka cluster is it not
correct sir
what do we know about that pulsar
a great deal sir it is a rotating neutron star of approximately four point three five six solar masses
mister crusher how long would it take us to get there
at warp seven thirty four minutes
mister crusher make it so
sir
set course for the lonka pulsar warp two
aye sir sir at warp two well arrive at the pulsar in thirty one hours
thank you ensign engage
aye sir
will we be delaying our rendezvous with the hood sir
we may have to number one
lieutenant contact the hood and inform them of our delay
aye commander
belay that order there will be no further communication off this ship without my prior authorisation commander may i have a word with you mister data you have the bridge
aye sir

number one you know i like to keep you well informed as to the nature of our missions
yes sir
and if i dont inform you there is a reason i dont like keeping you in the dark but for the next few days i may not be able to be as communicative as usual it may make things difficult for you
dont worry about me sir i can handle it
and the crew
you can count on all of us sir
i appreciate that number one


picard what are you doing
attempting to let our captors know that we possess intelligence
you dont think they already know that they can hear us talking
yes but they may not realise that were communicating through language
captain picard is letting them know we comprehend mathematics by tapping out the first six prime numbers
i know what hes doing im trying to understand why
it is imperative that we communicate with our abductors find out what they want
obviously they want us
obviously but why what made our captors choose us what makes us special
i couldnt say captain im certainly not special i am just one cadet
whats your best area of study
impulse propulsion systems im very good with field coils
good enough to be useful to our abductors
i dont know maybe but if they needed an engineer sir why didnt they take a real one why pick a starfleet cadet
that i cant answer the bolians are maintaining an uneasy truce with the moropa are they not
thats right but this doesnt look like moropa technology and even assuming the moropa wanted me what would they want with either of you
ive never even heard of the moropa my race has no enemies
none in the last three hundred years of mizarian history your planet has been conquered six times
and weve survived by not resisting mizarians value peace above confrontation
then you have no idea who might have done this
no i dont know of anyone who bears malice toward my race
or against you personally
you cant mean to suggest that someone with a personal grudge against me has gone to all this trouble
im not suggesting anything im merely trying to come up with some explanation for your abduction
im sorry picard i cant give you one i am neither important enough to hold for ransom nor radical enough to be dangerous im a simple public servant
nevertheless mister tholl

stop we mean you no harm we are prisoners like yourself we are not the enemy
who has done this
we dont know we were brought here the same way you were our captors refuse to show themselves
i dont trust you
you must trust us we wish only to return to our worlds were you abducted from chalna
you know my planet
oh yes i visited there twelve years ago while commanding the stargazer


five and twenty
ouch
if its too rich geordi fold
im thinking im thinking

enter
counsellor gentlemen forgive this intrusion i was just passing by
you are always welcome captain
i was wondering mister la forge whats our engine efficiency status
operating at ninety three percent sir
thats very good but i would like to increase the efficiency to ninety five percent
no problem captain ill get right on it
thats not an order you can get to it later i dont want to disrupt your recreation
no captain its no problem lady luck left me long ago

would you care to join us captain we have an opening
id rather just observe if you dont mind
not at all counsellor twenty

pair of threes
flush queen high
that beats my fours
well played counsellor may i have a word with you for just a moment
certainly sir
forgive me gentlemen ill return your player to you in a moment

counsellor i wanted to ask you about the crew how are they reacting to our sudden change in course
i sense no unusual reaction captain after all such a change is hardly out of the ordinary
theyre not curious or concerned as to why
theyre curious yes but concerned no they trust you
how far do you think that trust goes
sir
i know counsellor that the crew has always had full confidence in me but what if it were to change
well id inform you sir of course
thank you counsellor

my given name is esoqq it means fighter
ill bet half the names in the chalnoth language mean fighter
mizarians your names all mean surrender
we are a peaceful race a race of thinkers
a race of cowards and you i dont know your people
i am mitena haro of bolarus nine
who would want to imprison a child
im not a child
esoqq ive been trying to determine if we have a common enemy someone with a reason for confining us here
there are chalnoth who would kill me if they could but kidnap there is no reason
you have many enemies
none of consequence ive slain all the ones who mattered that shocks you bolian
a little
and you
im not surprised ive heard about your race youre uncivilised you have no laws no system of government
the chalnoth have no use for laws or governments we are strong we obey no one
you live in anarchy murdering one another that mentality may get us all killed
and you may be the first
both of you this is getting us nowhere
neither is asking us useless questions picard but if you must pursue the topic how long have you and the romulans been adversaries
for quite a while mister tholl i am perfectly willing to entertain the hypothesis that our captors are romulans but what would the romulans want with you
my brainpower perhaps its well known that my species possesses superior intelligence and i am considered among the brightest of my people
and the least modest
what is this
food
the only food
it would seem so
poison
does this mean theres nothing here for you to eat
you
dont even think that picard you wont let him
esoqq how long can you go without food
three days perhaps four
no longer
no longer

well all your tests indicate the same results you are in great shape
i never felt better
i see then why did you come in your annual physical isnt due for another month
well usually you have to remind me then badger me and finally order me to report for once i thought id save you the trouble
jeanluc be honest with your doctor are there any warning signs or symptoms that you havent told me about
as far as i know im perfectly healthy
well then return to your post
will you have dinner with me tonight
in ten forward
what about my quarters more intimate
jeanluc you are full of surprises today
i take that to be a yes

picard is it wise to attempt an escape
its imperative
why our captors havent mistreated us
weve been kidnapped locked in a room you dont think thats mistreatment
they havent hurt us have they i think we should just wait until we find out what they want be patient
we can no longer afford to be patient unless we act soon esoqq will starve
if we antagonise them they may decide were more trouble than were worth kill us and go capture another four
i agree thats a risk but i see no alternative
well i refuse to help
as you wish mister tholl we must get inside this panel
not very sturdy
stand back haro

the design is simple crosscircuiting the door mechanism should be easy
make it so
yes sir

i think ive got it

i warned you


out with it jeanluc
out with what
whatever has been on your mind all evening long
has it been that apparent how well you know me
after all this time i ought to
well its true i have been preoccupied i know thats not very flattering to you but i have been thinking about us and about the choices ive made
weve both made choices
and ive been wondering if they were the right ones sometimes i feel weve allowed our positions to isolate us
our positions necessitate a degree of professional detachment
but theres a danger in becoming too detached of never permitting ourselves to get closer
is that what you want jeanluc to get closer
youre a very attractive woman
and youre a very attractive man but we both know its not as simple as that
would it be simpler if i were not your commanding officer
simpler perhaps but thats not the only issue i guess right now im comfortable with our relationship just the way it is
would you care to dance
i thought you didnt dance
on special occasions

i dont think i told you but im glad youre back on the enterprise i missed our friendship
i did too

jeanluc if i didnt know you better i would think you were playing games with me
youre sorry you came tonight
i didnt say that
good because im delighted you did but perhaps we should call it a night

goodnight

i warned you not to provoke our captors the next beams might be lethal
not to you you moved far from the door
of course i did being stunned once was enough
you claim you were hit by the stun beam before the rest of us arrived you could be lying maybe our enemy is watching us from inside
are you accusing me of collaborating with our abductors
collaboration is what your species does best
you did try to talk us out of attempting to escape
for all we know you may be our captor
impossible im a mizarian my people are not aggressive
how can we be sure youre a mizarian you could be an impostor
this is nonsense what if youre an impostor esoqq was the last one to appear and he is the only one with a weapon
keep talking and i will use it
tholl our captors have transporters they have stun beams it is hardly likely that they would try to hold us at bay with a knife
well then maybe shes an impostor she could have triggered the stun beams deliberately
i was hit too
to forestall suspicion you were very quick to volunteer
tholl i asked her to open the door
you ordered her you mean youve been giving orders from the moment you got here trying to make everyone do what you want
tholl what i want is for everyone to escape
why should we believe you
captain picards put his life at stake for others many times the primitive culture on mintaka three the wogneer creatures in the ordek nebula

and cor caroli five
right helping to cure the phyrox plague
and how do we know this is the heroic captain picard we have no proof of his identity
youve wasted our time with failed attempts to communicate with them or escape is that your task to keep us busy so were off guard
first officers log supplemental although were still eighteen hours from the lonka pulsar the captain has ordered us to slow to one half impulse he has offered no explanation

i dont know why were going to this pulsar and creeping up on it at half impulse makes even less sense
the captain has given unusual orders before
i know but this is different hes different i cant put my finger on it but im worried
the captain does seem detached from his emotions

mister la forge we are operating at ninety six percent engine efficiency well done
thank you sir
when we arrive at the pulsar i shall require everyone at their best i know that i can rely on both of you
of course captain
excellent an ale for me and for my officers in fact ales for everyone

heres to the finest crew in starfleet you know back when i was in the academy we would follow every toast with a song i wonder if i can oh yes

come cheer up my lads tis to glory we steer to find something new in this wonderful year to honour we call you as free men and brave for who are so free as the sons of the waves hearts of oak are our ships jolly tars are our men we always are ready steady boys steady well fight and well conquer again and again

commander whats the captain up to
thats not the captain i know

were a mission that has no apparent purpose in itself i can accept that all of us can because the captain says its important and we trust him then he runs the crew through efficiency drills for the first time in my tour of duty but he says we need them so we need them because we trust our captain but we also have a captain singing drinking songs with his men
a captain whos come to the poker game for the first time
and he was very odd with me afterwards he wanted me to warn him if the crew started to lose confidence in him
any signs of mental stress or trauma
he came in for a physical with no word from me
anything unusual doctor
every test result identical to his last physical which is kind of unusual in itself actually
almost as though he wanted to establish that there was nothing wrong
there was one other thing he asked me to dinner in his cabin and it was a very unusual evening
which brings up a very serious possibility what if theres an outside influence at work here
i detect no evidence of telepathic coercion
commander there is still one fact we have not considered the abnormal energy reading in the captains quarters was never explained
it is not enough evidence to justify mutiny
nobody has suggested removing the captain from command right now all we have are suspicions not enough to act upon the next move is his

well picard prove to us youre not the enemy
i cant youre right mister tholl any of us may be the enemy and there is no way to prove that we arent but until we set aside our mutual fears and trust one another we have no hope of escape
but sir how can we trust each other
shes right there may be an enemy among us
and what if there is mister tholl shall we continue accusing one another until hostility leads to violence shall we allow our suspicions to destroy us now lets see if we can override this stun mechanism

helm take us in to twenty million kilometres
aye sir
mister worf divert enough power to the shields to offset the increased radiation and magnetic fields
sir at twenty million kilometres our shields will only be effective for eighteen minutes
noted mister data
captain may i have a word with you
you have the bridge mister data
aye sir

what is our mission
im under no obligation to tell you that
if you dont you force me to take command of this vessel
on what grounds
you are endangering this ship for no reason
no reason youre aware of
thats not good enough your behaviour has been erratic
erratic enough to justify mutiny do you honestly believe you have sufficient evidence to convince a board of inquiry
no i dont but i cant let you risk the lives of this crew
number one has it occurred to you that you might be the one with the problem im aware youve been under stress and i am willing to let the matter drop if you will report to sickbay for a full examination otherwise i will have to relieve you from duty think about it


cadet

i may have overloaded it sir

mister tholl
i still think this is a mistake

now what were no better off than when we started

captain number four shield has failed increasing power to number three shield to compensate
helm move us closer ten million kilometres
sir at that distance the ship will not withstand the magnetic fields and radiation we will not survive
take us in mister crusher
belay that order
youre relieved of duty commander mister worf confine mister riker to his quarters

mister worf i gave you an order
maintain your position lieutenant
youre destroying yourself and anyone who is foolish enough to listen to you
youve shown none of the concern that captain picard would for the safety of his ship the welfare of his crew
mister worf escort commander riker from the bridge
ensign crusher take us away from this pulsar heading one eight five mark three two full impulse
full impulse aye commander
engage

i hope youre satisfied picard youve accomplished nothing
the sound of your voice is beginning to anger me
well i think this charade has gone far enough  dont you
i dont understand
oh yes you do this isnt a holding cell its a laboratory maze a carefully structured test its an experiment to see how well we react under pressure
how do you know
its the only explanation look at the four of us we do have something in common we all react differently to authority you the collaborator defer to whoever has control you the anarchist reject authority in any form i a starfleet captain trained to command and you a starfleet cadet sworn to obey a superior officers authority our captors have placed us here and have devised obstacles for us to overcome they give us food which esoqq cant eat to make him a threat they give us a door we cant open until the four of us cooperate and each time we succeed they deal us reverses to set us against each other again while you observe our reactions
sir ive been trying to help
i found it unlikely that a first year cadet would know of the enterprises visit to mintaka three so i tested you starfleet has classified the cor caroli five plague as secret no cadet would have knowledge of that incident
captain
so you may as well drop this pretence im not playing any further im quitting the game as far as i am concerned this experiment is over
you are correct captain picard

to further our knowledge of alien interaction we borrowed you tholl and esoqq and replaced you with replicas
replicas
our transporter is able to replicate living matter including the brains many trillion dendritic connections where memory is stored
you mean theres a copy of me on mizar two
an impostor running my ship
no longer commander riker has taken charge of the enterprise
our species is telepathically linked we are all in continual contact
much more efficient than your primitive vocal communications
we would like to pursue this study but of course your awareness of it would taint the results
we will therefore return you to your places of origin


captain
hold your positions take no action

why did you choose to study the concepts of authority and leadership
because our species has no such concepts
as we are all identical distinctions among ourselves are meaningless hence we have no leaders no followers

we wanted to examine the nature of command
our replicas of tholl and esoqq explored this issue on mizar two and on chalna just as our picard replica did on the enterprise

your responses were most intriguing
you have no right to put us through this just to satisfy your curiosity
why not
because kidnapping is an immoral assault the rights of other races must be respected
this concept of morality is a very interesting human characteristic we shall have to study it sometime
now mister worf

what is it
why do you hold us
because there is something else you can learn with an alert crew even our primitive vocal communications are unnecessary with a single look i was able to inform my crew that i wanted to hold you here
but why
because ive decided to conduct an experiment of my own i want to see how you react to being imprisoned
captain our species cannot bear captivity
we were merely curious we meant no harm
we did not after all injure you in any way
imprisonment is an injury regardless of how you justify

and now that you have had a taste of captivity perhaps you will reconsider the morality of inflicting it upon others in any event we now know about your race and we know how to imprison you bear that in mind now get off my ship

mister crusher set course to rendezvous with the hood warp eight
aye sir its good to have you back sir
status number one
ship and crew functioning normally captain
then my doppelganger caused no serious damage the replica was convincing
very convincing but not perfect
not perfect in what way
well sir i find it hard to believe youre that good a singer
a singer i look forward to reading your report commander at least i think i do

doctor
captain

course laid in sir
engage
captains holiday



welcome to risa all that is ours is yours
 we are looking for the lodging chamber of captain jeanluc picard
a file scan reveals no record of a captain picard currently visiting risa
when is he expected to arrive
where is no arrival date on file for any such individual
 could we have been mistaken
he will come
first officers log stardate  we have departed gemaris five where for the past two weeks captain picard has been serving as mediator in a trade dispute between the gemarians and their nearest neighbour the dachlyds

welcome back deanna
its good to be back the last two weeks have been gruelling
i take it the captain was able to negotiate an agreement mutually beneficial to both parties
he was i dont know how he managed it the gemarians and the dachlyds are both incredibly stubborn people
the more difficult the task the sweeter the victory

go to warp four mister bennett set a course for starbase twelve report
everything status quo sir
very well if anyone needs me ill be in my ready room
sir congratulations
about what
about the trade agreement

is it my imagination or is something bothering the captain
he has been under a great deal of strain lately while we were on gemaris he ate sparingly and slept even less
anything we can do
actually i have a solution in mind but i doubt hell agree to it
what would that be
our captain needs a vacation


come
sir its been brought to my attention one of the crew has been neglecting his health again
how so
its a classic case of stressrelated ailments brought on by overwork exhaustion irritability muscle spasms yet he insists on ignoring them
doesnt sound too serious
and i plan to keep it that way
whats the treatment
a weeks shore leave
impossible
jeanluc i could make that an order
but you wont beverly you know i loathe vacations
you loathe going on vacations once youre there you have a marvellous time you told me your four days on zytchin three were wonderful
i lied look the enterprise is scheduled to spend a week undergoing maintenance overhaul at starbase twelve while there i promise that i will make full use of available recreation activity
watching some technician fill deuterium tanks is not my idea of fun
i suppose i could find a few hours to spend on the holodeck
forget the holodeck isnt there someplace you want to go
the astrophysics centre on icor nine is holding a symposium on rogue star clusters i had given serious thought to attending
the last thing you need is serious thought jeanluc why dont you go some place beautiful where you can relax and be pampered you deserve it
ill give it serious thought
captain
doctor enough

so have you decided where youre going yet
yes i have number one bridge
no i meant on your shore leave
not you too
halt i know this perfect little vacation spot in fact it falls within the coordinates of this sector
how convenient except number one i have absolutely no intention of taking a holiday is that clear
very clear
good im glad weve got that straightened out resume
the place is called risa and believe me captain it is a paradise warm tropical breezes exotic food nothing to do but sit around all day and enjoy the quiet and then
the women
of course
im sure you would find their sybaritic outlook on life very appealing
oh im sure

im glad to hear you say so sir
unfortunately this vessel is about to undergo extensive repairs requiring my personal supervision
what about risa
some other time number one
will ive just had some terrific news
really
theres an excellent chance my mother may be joining us on starbase twelve
your mother
shes returning home from a conference on achrady seven and shes going to try to rearrange her schedule so she can spend some time visiting with us
thats wonderful deanna
she mentioned how much she was looking forward to seeing you again captain
did she commander could i have a word with you


is something wrong captain
tell me number one is the entire crew aware of this little scheme to send me off on holiday
i believe there are two ensigns stationed on deck thirty nine who know nothing about it
i suppose this means i can look forward to a week of continual harassment on this subject  i admit ive been feeling a little fatigued


ill see to it that these bags are beamed directly to your room sir
you look very handsome if i might saying so captain
are you taking all these books
i thought id take some light reading in case i got bored
ulysses by james joyce ethics sophistry and the alternate universe by ving kuda you call that light reading
to each his own number one
have i mentioned how imaginative the risian women are sir
too often commander

i do have one request sir
you want me to bring you back a souvenir
its called a horgahn i dont think youll have any trouble finding one
consider it done
captain i would feel better if you would allow me to assign a security officer to you we will be out of communication range when we leave orbit
i really dont think that will be necessary mister worf risa has a reputation of being a most peaceful planet
aye sir
well the ship is yours number one
enjoy your trip captain
ill try counsellor

hes going to have a great time


i beg your pardon

god its so good to see you again

i think youve mistaken me for someone else
you know i think you might be right welcome to risa
a simple handshake would have sufficed



return  my apologies i fear i have yet to master the art of hoverball
so it would seem
my name is joval i am employed here is there anything you require to make your stay a more pleasant one

you find me amusing
no its just that you are the fifth woman to ask me that question this morning all i require is to sit in the sun and read my book alone
and afterward
i really havent thought that far ahead
then may i suggest a swim to be followed by a massage
some other time perhaps
i dont understand you say you wish to be alone yet you carry the horgahn
i just purchased that why are you implying this has some special meaning
the horgahn is the risian symbol of sexuality to own one is to call forth it powers to display it is to announce you are seeking jamaharon
riker
do you seek jamaharohn
i dont even know what it means the horgahn is for a friend
i see someone close to you
thats right
someone you love
i wouldnt go that far
your attitude is most puzzling i will leave you now to your book
that is all i ask

youre blocking the suns
i know youre working with her i warn you its a mistake
are you addressing me
dont bother to deny it ive seen the two of you together
i dont know what the devil youre talking about but whatever it is i assure you its no concern of mine
tell her i want the disc returned to me immediately
perhaps i have not made myself clear you have the wrong man
i am rapidly losing patience with you i demand you talk business
youll find ferengi demands carry little weight with me
obviously youve never dealt with my people before
on the contrary all too often
then you know the ferengi are not to be trifled with
or trusted
you dare to insult me
i advise you to listen closely for i will not say this again i came to risa for a holiday nothing more i have no knowledge of this woman of whom you speak nor have i laid eyes on any disc
you expect me to believe such feeble lies
i dont care what you believe
this is not over yet human the disc is mine and so is the woman remember that

hello
oh its you
thats not much of a greeting
look i dont wish to appear rude but i am not seeking jamaharon
all right but you really should try it some time
if i try it it will be at a time of my own choosing
thats fine with me its not as though i was offering to help you find it
i er i assumed because of the way you welcomed me the other day
im sorry if i embarrassed you
i dont recall saying i was embarrassed ifs just that i prefer to be acquainted with the women that i kiss
thats understandable the names vash
jeanluc picard
so tell me about yourself jeanluc

would you rather i guess i can be very persistent
im the captain of a federation starship
that explains it
explains what
i noticed you arguing with that ferengi for a moment there it looked like it was going to come to blows
youre the woman he was talking about
i hope your disagreement wasnt over me
for that information youll have to ask him
where are you going
to find some privacy
wait a second

what did he tell you im sure there wasnt a bit of truth to it
and you said you didnt know her
i dont and i dont want to
return the disc to me and all will be forgiven
the disc doesnt belong to you sovak it never did
it would seem you two have a lot to discuss if youll excuse me
jeanluc im sorry perhaps one day i could explain all this to you later

perhaps you can

i have a proposal i believe youll find most interesting
save your breath
i am willing to pay you your weight in gold in exchange for the disc is that not a generous offer

i must have that woman


what the hell are you doing in my room
we are vorgons i am ajur this is boratus
we come from the twenty seventh century we travelled three hundred years into the past to find you
all right lets assume for the moment i believe you that you are indeed from the future what is it that you want from me
have you heard of the tox uthat
what im aware of the legend it tells of a visitor from the future who left behind a mysterious device known as the tox uthat
essentially that story is correct
then the uthat actually exists
yes it was invented by a scientist named kal dano in the mid twenty seventh century the uthat is a quantum phase inhibitor capable of halting all nuclear reaction within a star
but why bring such a powerful weapon into the past
criminals attempted to steal the device so he fled back to the twenty second century where he hid it ajur and i were the security team assigned to retrieve the uthat
i gather you were unsuccessful
yes when we returned we began to search through the historical records for some clue to the uthats fate
and your search led you to me
we came upon a brief account stating you had discovered an object of unknown origin while vacationing on risa from its description a crystal cube that fits in the palm of the hand we surmised it could very well be the tox uthat
im sorry to disappoint you but i havent found anything including peace which is the only thing im looking for
you will find such a device captain to us it is already part of history
and if i do find it what then
you will give it to us immediately so that we may return with it
well the uthat belongs to your time not mine


may i come in
excuse the mess sovak has taken to searching my room periodically
is this what hes looking for

im sorry i had to hide it like that i was afraid hed start searching me next
this disc must contain some very valuable information
i doubt its anything youd be interested in
depends
on what
on whether or not it has something to do with the tox uthat
did sovak tell you that
well lets just say ive heard rumours that the uthat is located somewhere on risa
look the last thing i need is a partner
so its true
have a seat i dont suppose you ever heard of professor samuel estragon
yes as a matter of fact i have he spent half his life searching for the tox uthat
i served as his personal assistant for the past five years shortly before he died he uncovered new data pinpointing its location and that disc contains his research notes and maps
and youre continuing his work
exactly
with a ferengi as an associate
sovak and i are definitely not working together
but the two of you are very well acquainted
well at times he aided the professor in his explorations especially in situations that werent quite ethical
and now with typical ferengi logic hes convinced that the tox uthat belongs to him
all he cares about is selling it to the highest bidder
whereas you of course have a nobler purpose in mind
i told the professor id present it to the daystrom institute for study but first i have to find it and that wont be easy with sovak watching me every minute
ill go in your place
and what about me
youll remain here its safer
is that an order
absolutely
this isnt a starship jeanluc i dont follow orders
oh i see
besides youd never find it without me the professors notes are in code
from the moment i met you i knew you were going to be trouble
you look like a man who could handle trouble
so where exactly is the location
its about twenty seven kilometres due east there are some subterranean caves there thats where youll find the uthat
ill meet you in the lobby in fifteen minutes be punctual oh and i advise you to change your clothing
jeanluc were going to make a wonderful team


i expected such treachery did you think you could sneak away from me so easily

the disc where is it
didnt anyone tell you weapons arent allowed on risa
youre making a grave mistake putting your trust in this woman
it be a worse mistake to trust you
silence do you know how she acquired the disc in the first place
sovak
i paid her to steal it but instead she betrayed me and used my money to make her way here
it didnt happen that way
shes a greedy and unscrupulous woman a perfect mate for a ferengi
youre becoming quite annoying sovak
as are you human perhaps i should kill you and then take the disc
no wait you can have it

see i told you wed make a wonderful team
weve got long trip


have you calculated how much further we have to go
another eleven kilometres
we should stay here for the night
i was hoping youd say that
actually weve made better time than i expected
ill take that as a compliment
as it was intended
jeanluc im afraid i havent been totally honest with you
forgive me if i dont act surprised
sovak did pay me to hand over the disc
so you did steal it
it wasnt stealing the professor had died i had already devoted five years of my life to tracking down the uthat
but you took sovaks money
it was the only way i could afford to get to risa as for sovak he got exactly what he deserved
well any woman who can beat a ferengi at his own game bears watching
ill take that as another compliment im flattered
hmm well we should get some sleep
you know jeanluc its lucky for you we met if it wasnt for me youd still be back there sitting in the sun relaxing
that happens to be why i came to risa
im sure you hated every minute of it that kind of vacation isnt for a man like you you need excitement
excitement spending in a damp cave chasing after something we shall probably never find
youre enjoying yourself arent you
yes
i just wanted to hear you say it
good now lets get some sleep

ill never forget that look on your face when you thought i was offering you jamaharon
now that was a simple misunderstanding
you did seem a little disappointed when i turned you down
you are outrageous
thank you youre pretty stimulating yourself dont you see were a lot alike thats probably why we get along so well
you call this getting along
fine we dont get along were not getting along
i didnt say that
no if you want to believe were not getting along thats all right with me

still think im trouble
im sure of it


this is it weve reached the end of our journey
do you have the exact location
seven metres in from the opening along the wall
that should make it about here
what the
something wrong
i cant get a reading on this there must be starithium ore in these rocks
that leaves us but one alternative

shall we

picard
a little premature arent we
we are to be witness to a great moment picard
who the hell are they
they are security officers from the twenty seventh century theyre here to take back the uthat
you knew about this and didnt say anything
im sorry vash would you have brought me here if i had told you
probably not
my point exactly
so the betrayer is herself betrayed youve put together quite a little team
do not interrupt the captain
how did you get here
i found the disc in her room
thats impossible i made a copy as a precaution but i burned it before we left
only the outer casing was incinerated now i had no intention of interrupting you please continue digging

no one told you to stop digging human
i see no reason to continue
you will do as i say
look about you sovak by now it must be obvious even to you the uthat is not here
is this some pathetic attempt at trickery of course its here we simply havent found it yet
are you saying that the professors findings were wrong
it would appear so
but how could that be his evidence was overwhelming
enough with this foolishness cant you see hes trying to deceive us return to work this instant
im afraid hes right sovak according to the disc we should have reached it hours ago
lies treachery this cannot be happening not another failure not after having come so close
it is most puzzling

its over sovak
no i will not be cheated out of my prize tell him tell him the professors research is irrefutable
i dont know anymore
then step aside

the uthat is here somewhere its just waiting to be found it cant hide from me forever

five years of my life wasted
there will be other treasures to be found vash
not like the uthat i hope you wont mind but i need to be alone

enterprise to captain picard
picard here

go ahead commander
we hope were not interrupting anything important captain but we wanted to inform you that we have achieved orbit around risa and were ready to beam you aboard at your convenience

ill be returning shortly commander in the interim stand ready to initiate transporter code fourteen at my signal

transporter code fourteen

you heard me number one

yes sir

picard out

leaving so soon
jeanluc i was just about to come say goodbye
well then ive saved you the bother
i want to put all this behind me as soon as possible you understand
of course theres just one last thing you can do for me
anything
tell me where youve hidden the tox uthat
thats not funny
you never intended to burn that second disc if you had you wouldnt have been so careless as to allow sovak to salvage any of it you wanted him to follow us so that he could see for himself that the uthat wasnt at the cave site that was the only way he could be convinced that your quest had been futile
but how could i have known the uthat wasnt there
because youd already been there once before probably the moment you arrived on the planet thats when you found it
youre a man of many talents jeanluc

a piece of the future

a very dangerous piece were you really going to give this to the daystrom institute
well maybe not give it five years is a huge investment jeanluc i deserve to make a reasonable profit
congratulations picard we knew you would not fail us
youre not going to just hand it over are you you didnt trust me what makes you think you can trust them
i assume the vorgons have proof to back up their claim
our being here is proof enough
wait a second vorgons the professors notes said it was two vorgons a male and a female who attempted to steal the uthat in the first place for all we know it could be them
youre going to have to prove that you are who you say you are
you yourself said the uthat belongs to the future
but not necessarily to you
you will return what is ours
no

enterprise code fourteen lock on present coordinates two second delay mark

are you all right  go return to your own time theres nothing for you here
history recorded that you destroyed the uthat
you have fulfilled your destiny all too well picard

i dont suppose there are any openings for an archaeologist aboard the enterprise
somehow i doubt youd find life aboard a starship suitable to your taste
probably not i could never tolerate all that discipline
so what are your plans
i thought i might explore the ruins on sarthong five
unbelievable you are out of your mind the sarthongians are merciless to trespassers
why jeanluc you really do care about me
promise me you will try and stay out of trouble
i always try

i wish we had more time together
perhaps we do the vorgons are time travellers now that they know where and when the uthat can be found they may very well come back and try for it again
so we may be doing this all over again

welcome aboard captain
status report number one
all went well on starbase twelve i think youll find the ship to be in splendid condition
ill present my compliments to the crew oh yes number one about that horgahn you requested
yes sir
you and i need to have a little chat about that
was it a relaxing trip captain
uh huh
i knew hed have a great time
tin man

captains log stardate  the enterprise is preparing detailed exospheric charts of the hayashi system although tedious this endeavour is the first step toward planet colonisation

captain sensors report the uss hood is closing on an intercept course at high warp
thats odd we werent notified of a rendezvous
they seem to be in an awful hurry
sir we are being hailed on a secured channel by captain desoto
on screen
sorry to sneak up on you like that jean luc
robert why didnt you inform us
out here you never know whos listening keeps you on your toes anyway hey will will you getting soft on that luxury liner
so old friend how are you
well you know they send you galaxy class boys out here to the far reaches me im just hauling my butt back and forth between starbases
but not today
no not today starfleets got new orders for you this is top priority they need the fastest ship in the fleet and the best people that is you
if time is so important why didnt they transmit the orders by subspace
theyre worried about romulan eavesdropping on this one and weve got a passenger for you hard to send by subspace
what sort of passenger
mission specialist hell bring your orders aboard with him his name is tam elbrun
as in tam elbrun of the ghorusda disaster
the same what can i say your orders are to cooperate fully with him best of luck folks hood out
sir the hood is slowing to impulse
mister data come with me
captain let me come with you to greet tam
you know him
i do he was at the university on betazed when i studied psychology there
oh i see he was a colleague of yours
no he was a patient

tam is a telepath of extraordinary talent even for a betazoid hes a specialist in first contact with new life forms

hes a very unique person but hes not what you might expect captain

welcome aboard the enterprise im
captain picard right here  you want to know all about your mission everythings on there orders and briefings destination and heading all that dee i sensed you were out here howve you been
ive been fine but i thought
you were on thought you were on chandra five
sir
who what are you
i am data an android
incredible an android i cant read you at all its like youre not there
data
oh you better hurry up to the bridge with that captain wants you to run the orders scan the technical schematics and be ready to brief him in ten minutes right
number one
riker here
will you meet commander data on the bridge he has our orders and new heading
aye sir

and assemble the bridge staff for a mission briefing in fifteen minutes picard out mister elbrun would you
care to see my quarters no id rather get this briefing over with then be left alone until im needed

ive heard something about ghorusda werent there about forty people killed
forty seven including the captain of the adelphi and two friends from my class at the academy
sorry

main bridge
so what happened
it was a first contact situation ghorusdan culture is so complex and different that the federation sent a specialist to prevent misunderstanding
so that was tam elbrun what happened was his fault
not directly board of inquiry blamed darson for carelessness about ghorusdan cultural taboos but if elbrun was so good why didnt he warn darson what was he doing there if he couldnt sense that much hostility

our destination is the beta stromgren system following the path of the vega nine probe
thats twenty three parsecs beyond our furthest manned explorations
that is correct commander apparently the probe has discovered astonishing



our orders are to proceed to this star beta stromgren scientists have discovered that it is in the final stages of an alternating cycle of expansion and collapse and will soon result in a supernova however the unmanned long range space probe sent by starfleet to observe the process has discovered something much more
oh data dont waste time they call it tin man the vega probe found it orbiting stromgren
looks like some kind of ship
its energy source is unknown the people whove studied the transmissions think its a starship and theyre sure its alive
alive how
a cybernetic organism like the borg
no no no here starfleet believes its an organic creature born in space living its life in the wastes between stars no one knows where it came from or why its here but were going to meet it were going to talk to it im going to talk to it
have attempts been made
to communicate with it by subspace of course linguacode universal translation all that it wont work tin man is too different direct mind to mind contact is our only hope
the opportunity for discovery is extraordinary but i dont understand starfleets urgency
romulans
hell i forgot the romulans
they claim that sector of space where beta stromgren is located
the romulans claim all that is in their field of vision
they routinely monitor the telemetry of our deep space probes
then they will certainly be sending a ship of their own to investigate this tin man
no actually theyre sending two data
that is correct starbase one two three has detected two ddaridex class cruisers on an intercept course the top speed of this class cruiser is known to be less than ours therefore we do have some advantage
then its a race an alien intelligence a new life form representing a technology far beyond that of either the romulans or ourselves the romulans will certainly take whatever measures are required to secure this creature for study
study as in dissecting id bet
mister data you are our resident honour student in exobiology im assigning you to head up the life sciences on this mission
aye sir
excellent
meeting adjourned then

so data i guess youre the brains of this outfit huh
mister elbrun one of the reasons im asking you to work closely with a member of my staff is to avoid any further omissions the possibility of an encounter with romulans on this mission is hardly trivial and yet
all right all right i should have brought up the romulans earlier but i was distracted and no billy boy i wasnt distracted on ghorusda if darson had listened to me no one would have died no well i dont care whether you believe that or not
captains log supplemental travelling at high warp we are still several days from rendezvous with the mysterious entity which starfleet has christened tin man my immediate concern is with tam elbrun starfleet considers his unique abilities crucial to our mission yet he seems to me unstable

well according to his medical records and psych profile hes very high on the esp scale a sort of prodigy
a prodigy in what sense
well in most betazoids our telepathic gifts develop at adolescence
you mean youre not born reading minds
no except for some reason that no one understands occasionally a betazoid child is born different
how different
born with his telepathic abilities switched on
most betazoids born like that never lead a normal life
the noise of other peoples thoughts and feelings must be overwhelming incomprehensible especially to a child
and painful early diagnosis and special training did help tam adjust but he has some problems
you mentioned a hospitalisation
for stress repeatedly throughout his life
i always wonder what holds one person together through that kind of struggle while another goes under
yes well hes evidently done more than hold together hes the indispensable man the federations finest specialist in communication with unknown life forms
the more unusual a life form is the better he likes it his personnel file shows that hes gravitated toward assignments that isolate him from other humanoids

commander data im picking up an unusual echo from my navigational sensors
something is out there sir tracking us matching our speed and heading something which does not fully register on our instruments
since there is no known natural phenomenon capable of travel at warp velocities there are but two possibilities either it is a sensor malfunction another ship is following us covertly
it is not a sensor malfunction
agreed
but commander if it is a romulan ship with their cloaking device we shouldnt pick them up at all
unless theyre pulling so much power for something else that they cant fully cloak
like what
ask the romulans if it is the romulans
lieutenant continue monitoring the precise position of the echo any sudden change in its behaviour initiate yellow alert
aye sir

come in

howre things in the land of the living
i thought you might be lonely no one sees you except data
lonely i can hear everything that everyone on this ship thinks no one besides you seems to be missing my charming
you want them to dislike you why
because im not a nice man okay okay because they scare me theyre too many minds i cant shut them out i never could learn all their loves their hates their fears their needs its like a tide that never ebbs i could drown
i remember
you understood at least a little how i felt i see you finally found a place to fit in people to care about
and youre still looking
then theres ghorusda ive got enough doubt in my reliability without having to listen to rikers and picards
what happened there
i thought everyone knew
no what happened to you
maybe i got too involved with the ghorusdans with their point of view it happens to me i wanted everyone to get along i could have warned darson more forcefully
so after that you ran away the last i heard you were the only federation delegate assigned to chandra five
beautiful creatures the chandrans their minds are glacial they have a lovely three day ritual for saying hello peaceful untroubled people
unlike humanoids
well except for your friend data i like him hes restful
i believe your impression of data is probably unique
yeah well having to get to know someone just once has its appeal i mean talking to them instead of getting it all at once up here whether i want it or not
but you accepted this mission you could have stayed on chandra five you willingly came aboard a ship with over a thousand people
how could i not think of it dee this intelligence that swims naked through space like a fish in the sea totally alien mysterious not like us at all ancient and alone so lonely for so long
how can you know that tam youre in contact with it with tin man arent you
no well yes a little but not quite on a conscious level
were light years away thats impossible even for you
impossible for me maybe not impossible for tin man

status report number one
weve reached the outer regions of the beta stromgren system on course for orbital intercept of tin man eta eighteen minutes
grand
not altogether astrophysics reports that the stars rate of collapse has increased it could go supernova in the next few days
captain we are receiving relayed sensor data from the vega probe including visuals
on screen

magnify

remarkable computer locate tam elbrun
tam elbrun is in turbolift one en route to the main bridge
of course
captain our sensors are detecting a subspace wave front of highly ionised particles preceding the object which is tracking us

yellow alert on screen

romulan warbird closing they are arming main disruptors captain
go to red alert shields to maximum
arm photon torpedoes and stand by mister worf
aye sir
i thought you said the enterprise was faster than this romulan
in fact we are commander however
evasive mister crusher hailing frequencies
i guarantee that they dont want to talk to you captain

the romulan has passed us
damage report
casualties reported seventy percent loss to the shields
their attack on us was incidental captain
incidental
yes to delay us
captain it would appear that the romulans intent is to contact tin man first at any cost according to my sensor readings the warbird has exceeded maximum engine output by thirty percent they seem to have irreparable damage to their warp coils
so they kept up with us by sacrificing their ability to reenter romulan space
one way trip
there is one more trailing us captain a day or two behind datas right this ones job is to beat us to tin man at any cost
you read all this telepathically
in the mind of the romulan commander during the attack
very well mister crusher all stop
aye sir
commander la forge
la forge here
geordi

how long to full shield restoration
im working on it computer reconfigure structural integrity power to feed inner deflector grid
unable to comply requested reroute would compromise operational safety limits
to hell with the limits override authorization la forge theta two nine nine seven
rerouting structural integrity power supply
russell watch the lateral grid balance no no no thats too much were going to have to do it manually la forge to bridge
go ahead
captain im trying to feed the inner grid by stealing some power from the structural integrity field you should have partial shielding in thirty minutes
you have ten picard out

if the romulans wish the honour of the first contact let them have it
youre out of your mind picard what if the romulans find a way to persuade tin man to
i think the chances of that is remote and if you will be still mister elbrun you may learn
what
that being first at any cost is not always the point mister data while we await repairs i want life sciences and engineering to continue collecting information on the alien and query the vega nine probe long range sensors
aye sir

you do a lot of your work here
yes i have configured these instruments to display information with greater speed and efficiency than stations used by the others
nice a little spartan
spartan
lots of work space not much room to live i dont guess you sleep
i have tried it from time to time but you are correct i do not require rest
but you paint
the creatures anatomy appears most peculiar
in what way
it is indeed laid out as a vessel with what appear to be corridors and chambers an internal environment suitable for carbon based life forms is being maintained yet there is no evidence of a crew aboard tin man is a living being which has been bred or has adapted itself to serve a purpose i find that interesting
why must living beings have a purpose or do we exist for no reason but to exist
i do not believe i am qualified to express an opinion
ah data youre uniquely qualified you think a great deal about humanity and youre an honest researcher you dont treat anything as trivial or irrelevant you want to try it all
you said in the transporter room that you could not read my mind
true enough but i think i understand you pretty well it worries you that i cant read your mind
perhaps there is nothing to read nothing more than mechanisms and algorithmic responses
perhaps youre just different not a sin you know though you may have heard otherwise

captain the romulan ship is hailing the alien using their equivalent of linguacode
response
nothing so far commander
why should it answer what could it possibly have in common with them
but youre so sure itll talk to you
captain the romulans are arming all disruptors
yellow alert prepare for evasive action at the first change in the romulans course
with our shields in their present condition we cant
no no were not the target its tin man
what do you mean do they intend to destroy it
those are their orders if they cant secure the alien
increase speed to intercept the romulan vessel
their lead is too great sir
hail them we cannot allow them
they wont listen to you

danger gomtuu do not allow

damage report
nothing available yet sir we have partial failure of the main computer
it seems you woke your tin man

weve got impulse power but ive got to take the warp engines offline while we recalibrate the intermix regulators
how long
for everything or just for the warp engine
all of it
commander were looking at twenty hours work here double shifts
we dont know that we have twenty hours that star could explode at any moment
i know okay first thing we need to do is get the main computer working right
no we fix the shields first
commander whatever tin man hit us with it fried circuits i thought were unfryable
im not worried about tin man its more romulans showing up
right first priority get the shields up only lets not have any more surprises till im done okay
dont ask me about surprises ask tam elbrun

your brain activity suggests that youre coming out of a sort of fugue or seizure your blood pressure and glucose are indicative of general systemic stress
but im going to live
no doubt about it
good because i want to know exactly what you did i want to know how closely you are in communication with the alien and what youve learned about it and i want to know now
i just warned it thats all ive been in contact with it sensing impressions from it it calls itself gomtuu its old captain its roamed the universe for many thousands of years
where did it come from how many
far away maybe beyond the galaxy once there were millions of them
once
it hasnt seen another of its kind for millennia its alone it may be the last of its species
perhaps we can help it in some way can you ask it to return with us to federation space at least persuade it to leave the vicinity of beta stromgren before the star explodes
captain gomtuu knows that the star will go nova soon thats why its here it wants to die there was an explosion in space radiation penetrating the outer layers the crew oh the crew died such loss empty pain hollowness
tam stop this youre losing yourself in this this merging
i know i know tin man hurts and wants to die i cant do any more from out here if you want me to really reach tin man i have got to be in physical contact i have got to go aboard
no that is absolutely out of the question
you dont trust me
no tam i dont believe that i do tam when you reached out to the alien to warn it did you give any thought to this vessel to the danger however inadvertent that creature might pose to our crew or did you simply react out of instinct
captain
deanna hes right i dont know i dont know what might happen but if you dont let me go we fail our mission besides at this point you need all the help you can get even tin mans

russell reactivate the sensor assemblies okay lets do a programme reload port array only good thats good computer run level two diagnostic
port sensor array remains offline
damn
riker to la forge hows it coming
not good i think all the control processors are shot but maybe if i swap the chips from the secondary array i can give you a minimum em scan
do it
okay russell were going to try starting retro sensor element thirty two only you in go the good news is that we have partial long range sensors la forge to bridge
riker here
im picking up another echo on the long range sensor display here you getting that

on your panel
worf
one moment commander confirmed sir the other romulan ship on an intercept course
geordi are we going to have those shields anytime soon
im doing the best i can

but shields wont help if that star explodes

data you seem to have developed an affinity with elbrun troi youve known him for years how far can he be trusted
captain the issue isnt one of trust in tams intentions but in his judgment i would trust him to do what he believes is right
yes of course but his judgment
is precarious the stress of exposure to so many minds on the ship is bad enough now hes strongly drawn to this creature im afraid for him
afraid of what
i sense that the alien is somehow calling him if we allow him to do as he insists to beam over im believe that we will lose him to it that he will lose himself
captain i agree that tams motives are trustworthy and i do not believe it is possible that he will act against us or will cause tin man to act against us out of malice
captain if tam breaks down over there well be no closer to accomplishing our mission it would be a grave mistake
thank you both

data
i am puzzled sir we have come this far are you not going to allow tam to fulfill his mission
tam elbrun warned tin man the first thing it did was to destroy a space vessel
i believe i understand sir if you feel the risk is too great to send tam elbrun alone then send me with him
counselor troi understands him better
but he is more comfortable with me sir it is humanity he is fleeing sir i can serve as an intermediary a bridge back a reminder of his obligations both to us and to tin man

captain the romulan has uncloaked
status number one
shields are at forty percent we can manoeuvre on impulse sir
phasers available on manual sir computer target lock not functioning
well lets hope theyre in a mood to talk hailing frequency
open
romulan vessel this is captain jeanluc picard of the uss enterprise
enterprise your presence here is a violation of romulan space you will leave immediately
we are not familiar with the terms of your claim on this sector were here engaged in scientific research do you wish to participate
we have monitored the destruction of our sister ship by the star creature we claim right of vengeance we will destroy the alien if you interfere we will destroy you as well
captains log supplemental a confrontation between the romulan warbird and tin man is imminent i have no alternative but to rely on the telepathic abilities of tam elbrun

picard to tam elbrun
captain
report to transporter room six immediately
captain i dont
commander data will meet you there
yes captain
counsellor we no longer have a choice


no no too much too much
tam
i cant
data to enterprise enterprise come in
no dont
if it is harming you we must return enterprise respond
its all right its all right now gomtuu was trying to communicate a lifetime of experiences to me in a few seconds but im all right now

obrien to bridge
go ahead chief
i lost the transporter lock on them

some kind of force field went up
confirmed the alien has thrown up a shield it is blocking all our sensors captain the romulans weapons systems are now at full power
follow them in mister crusher red alert mister worf arm photon torpedoes
aye sir


yes

there is a large chamber twenty metres ahead
i know i know everything now come on



intriguing
this is the control centre where gomtuus crew guided their journeys the ship and the crew existed symbiotically they needed one another when gomtuu had no one left to care for it no longer had a reason to exist
is that the purpose of existence to care for someone
it is for me deanna was right ill lose myself here

i must remind you that our objective is to bring tin man out of danger and report our findings to starfleet
im not going back data im staying here

sir the romulans are hailing us
captain picard if you interfere with us we will fire upon you as well
commander we are prepared to defend the life of the alien screen off shields up
power levels aboard the alien are increasing sir
captain the diameter of the star has decreased by one hundred thousand kilometres
its beginning


explain to them make them understand
but our mission
is to save tin man and i will but hes going to save me as well all my life i have waited for this a chance to find peace finally all the voices are silent only tin man speaks to me now dont you see data this is where i belong

that stars going to go any minute sir
the romulans know that as well as we do
power levels aboard tin man are increasing beyond our sensor range

conn report
dead stop captain sir weve been thrown clear of beta stromgren a distance of three point eight billion kilometres
there is no sign of tin man or the romulans sir captain on screen

data
sir
data what happened over there
difficult to explain captain
tam
i believe he found what he was looking for counsellor
captains log supplemental with all main systems at least temporarily restored we are proceeding to starbase one five two for inspection and additional repairs we have had no further encounter with the romulans as for the whereabouts of tin man and tam elbrun we can only speculate

you sent for me
yes counsellor it was tams final request that i explain his decision to the crew but i believe his hope was that you would understand
what did happen
i witnessed something remarkable individually they were both so
wounded isolated
yes but no longer through joining they have been healed grief has been transmuted to joy loneliness to belonging
data you do understand
yes counsellor when tin man returned me to the enterprise i realised this is where i belong
hollow pursuits



i dont want any trouble here barclay
trouble why would there be trouble
because wherever you go trouble follows
lieutenant barclay youre on duty
is that a fact
it is and youll observe it so get back to your post
look pal why dont you do me a favour take yourself and your holier than thou attitude and get out of my life

this is insubordination mister barclay
 heres to insubordination

riker youre nothing but a pretty mannequin in a fancy uniform youre full of hot air if picard has a problem with me you can tell him to come and talk to me himself

i feel your confidence your arrogant resolve it excites me
lieutenant barclay report to cargo bay five now
itll have to wait till later darling
oh
be right there save programme

i just dont know what to do with him the guys always late he never gives his best effort just slides by im telling you i cant deal with it anymore i mean how does a guy like that make it through the academy
i think its time we talked to the captain about broccoli thats what wesley calls him keep it to yourself
it fits

commander a broken seal
youd better destroy it those samplesll be tainted

hey is it a problem for you to report to duty on time lieutenant
 no no sir im im very sorry sir its just i had a very important communiqu which required my immediate response and
i dont want to hear it now were having an intermittent problem with this antigrav unit i want you to see what you can do
mister barclay im tired of seeing your name on report i dont know what you got away with at your last posting but this is the enterprise we set a different standard here understood
understood sir
captains log stardate  we are taking on a load of special tissue samples donated by the mikulaks for shipment to nahmi four the samples could prove vital to the containment of an outbreak of correllium fever on that world

everything looks it looks normal to me
computer activate antigrav unit

damn it
i i dont understand
la forge to engineering ill need more people in cargo bay five anyone you can spare la forge out we could use a hand mister barclay
ill disassemble it later commander it shouldnt do that well i mean of course it shouldnt do that well i mean it shouldnt do that

im not accustomed to seeing an unsatisfactory rating for one of my crew
i guess the issue is whether mister barclay is enterprise material
i assume from your request for his transfer that you think hes not commander
i hate to say it but i always thought i could work with anybody but i just dont understand this guy broccoli makes me nervous captain he makes everybody nervous
broccoli
young mister crusher started that i guess its caught on
lets just get that uncaught shall we theres every indication hes served competently in starfleet for years his ratings aboard the zhukov were satisfactory in fact i recall captain gleason speaking quite highly of him before his transfer
in retrospect i wonder if captain gleason wasnt buttering our bread a little he knew we were looking for a diagnostic engineer ive examined barclays psychological profile hes a history of seclusive tendencies it was noted at the academy more than once
and yet he chose this way of life he has made the same commitment to starfleet that we all have its easy to transfer a problem to someone else too easy
captain its not like i havent tried
try harder geordi hes a member of your team try to find some way to help him to make a positive contribution get to know the man better make him your best friend
with all respect sir my best friend i can barely tolerate being in the same room with the man
then i suggest you put your personal discomfort on one side commander dismissed
yes sir


hey reg how er hows it going
oh its er i still havent traced down the problem commander
thats all right theres no problem
ive been planning to run diagnostics on the graviton invertor circuits
smart plan id say were in good hands here
ill see you get a preliminary report
whenever
before the end of the day
fine say reg how about sitting in on the mission briefing with my senior officers in the morning
the briefing me
id like your input
what on do do do you want me to prepare a
no no just be there eight hundred hours
ill be on time sir
good good carry on

morning start your brains gentlemen and lets do it has anybody seen lieutenant barclay
not yet sir
okay

okay this trip to nahmi four is pretty routine so well have plenty of time to realign the magnetic capacitors on both the matter and antimatter injectors duffy costa thatll be your assignment
we probably ought to do the flow regulator maintenance at the same time commander
thats a good idea ensign crusher will putting in some hours with us this week as part of his training duties so ill be assigning him to assist you mister myers be sure and teach him the difference between impulse and warp drive please lieutenant barclay has working on the mystery of the antigrav failure we had yesterday your preliminary report had a couple of interesting theories reg why dont you bring us all up to speed on your findings so far
yes it wasnt a maintenance problem everything checked out i im going to check for a surge in the transfer coils
a coil surge wouldnt have resulted in field dissipation
i i i realise that
but we shouldnt ignore the possibilities wes
you ought to check the flow capacitor a breakdown of that could have caused a chain collapse of the antigrav fields
i i was going to
good okay then lets go over the realignment procedure gentlemen

i just didnt know what to say
what do you wish you had said
i should have told him to mind his own damned business i knew about the flux capacitor i didnt need to hear about it from some seventeen year old kid
youre letting it get you much too upset
you think so
why are you so hard on yourself
you dont know its hard out there
i understand but let go of it youre here now
youre right of course
of course let me help you relax

id like that
i knew you would

thats nice but im in the mood for someplace a little more unusual computer run barclay programme fifteen



i am the goddess of empathy cast off your inhibitions and embrace love truth joy


but i thought thats the point of the briefing to discuss different approaches
its not that you did anything wrong wes its just that barclays well hes my new project
yeah broccolis a real project all right
i just need to draw him out some more
and i shut him down poor broccoli
pardon me but why is lieutenant barclay being referred to clandestinely as a vegetable
its a joke data you know a nickname
nicknames generally denote fondness a diminutive shared between friends
datas absolutely right the nickname stops here and now captains orders

what the hell
what happened to your glass


nucleosynthesis the structure of the glass has been altered at the atomic level
a problem with the replicator
unlikely a problem with the replicator would have affected the contents as well as the glass but the liquid in the glass was a synthehol replication of a light ale of earth origin which is i believe what lieutenant duffy ordered
i cant detect any residual radiation or unusual chemical compounds that would have caused this
the most probable explanation is that the glass came into contact with an unshielded power source
that means a complete diagnostic check of the enterprise power systems all four thousand of them do i have the perfect man for this job hey reg busy
well i was just no not really why
ive got another mystery for you somehow the molecular structure of this cup from ten forward has been altered we need to run through the power systems to see if theres a leak that caused this
i had i was going to do that
you were
yes to to try to explain the antigrav unit failure i still cant nothing about it makes sense
then it is possible these two very disparate incidents could be related


i wouldnt bother you with something this minor commander but it may be a symptom of a more serious problem
do you think well need to put in to a starbase
well have a better idea after mister barclay runs a check on the power systems
it was lieutenant barclay who first suggested a link between the two incidents
what no it wasnt i mean not really
will your investigation affect our available power during the mission
no no sir well have to shut off some systems well shut them down a few at a time it shouldnt i dont think so
good i look forward to your report mister broccoli  barclay
if you will excuse me

metathesis is one of the most common of pronunciation errors sir a reversal of vowel and consonant barc to broc


yes i know him comes in he stands at the bar he doesnt say much he orders a warm milk
figures
warm milk helps you sleep la forge you should try it whats this have to do with barclay
i dont know im just trying to figure the man out do you ever talk to him
he doesnt talk much
does he have any friends
not that ive seen
what do you do with a guy like that
well i just serve him warm milk and let him be
yeah well im not so lucky i cant let him be hes my problem
well hes imaginative
how do you know that
i know
well then maybe hes in the wrong line of work
you engineering types dont appreciate imagination
thats not it guinan he just doesnt fit in here
terkim
what
reminds me of terkim my mothers brother sort of the family misfit everybody told me to stay away from him bad influence
did you
are you kidding he was the only member of the family who had a sense of humour except no one ever stayed around him long enough to realize it but me my mother tells me i remind her of him and i probably do the idea of fitting in just repels me
maybe im not make myself clear guinan barclay well hes always late the mans nervous nobody wants to be around this guy
if i felt that nobody wanted to be around me id probably be late and nervous too
guinan thats not the point
are you sure excuse me
computer where is lieutenant barclay

reg

beverly
good morning my lord manners my son manners you embarrass me before our guest master barclay will spank you if you misbehave
wesley 
what do you want
well i guess i want master barclay
the boys got into another little scrap im afraid but boys will be boys

you cannot withstand our assault forever barclay
you are outnumbered mister barclay say you will yield and it ends here
i will speak with my sword sir
in gods name where did you learn to fight like this man
self taught my capitaine shall i give you a few lessons

who is that one of your allies
jeanluc not that old trick im very disappointed in you


ill make it easy for you commander ill request reassignment
now wait a minute
look we both know the whole ship knows i just cant cut it here
hey barclay ive spent a few hours on the holodeck too you know now as far as im concerned what you do in the holodeck is your own business as long as it doesnt interfere with your work
youre youre not going to tell anyone about this
i dont think everybody would appreciate your imagination like i do it is kind of unusual recreating people you already know
well it was just i needed to blow off some steam because one one of the officers had been getting on my back
let me guess
it was you and i just couldnt tell you what i wanted to tell you to your face so it just sort of got out of control
i dont know theres a part of this thats kind of therapeutic maybe you ought to talk to counsellor troi about it
its its i when im in there im just more comfortable you dont know what a struggle this has been for me commander
id like to help if i can
being afraid all the time of forgetting somebodys name not knowing what to do with your hands i mean im the guy who writes down things to remember to say when theres a party and then when he finally get there he winds up alone in the corner trying to look comfortable examining a potted plant
youre just shy barclay
just shy sounds like nothing serious doesnt it you cant know
obrien to la forge
go ahead

i need you in transporter room three commander

on my way chief listen reg i really do want you to talk to counselor troi
troi no no no no no i couldnt
i mean it as your friend and as your commanding officer

i was synchronising the phase transition coils i didnt do anything i havent done a hundred times before the test object is made of pure duranium
seems normal enough to me
watch this

im glad i dont have anywhere to go
chief engineers log stardate  a systems analysis of transporter room three has yielded no suggestion of a cause for the latest malfunction aboard the enterprise

is this part of the same pattern
we dont know sir and we dont know why only transporter room three is affected none of the other transporter rooms are malfunctioning
yet
we reach nahmi four in twenty two hours well want all transporters operational by then i want a level one diagnostic across the board
advise mister barclay to join us on the bridge immediately
could we make that fourteen hundred hours sir ive got him working on something
fourteen hundred hours mister obrien no maintenance on the transporters until further notice
aye sir

i know this is difficult for you is there anything i can do to make you more comfortable
no
have you ever been with a counsellor before
yes no
which one
yes but she it wasnt it wasnt really a counsellor
most people find a counsellor intimidating at first its okay if you feel that way toward me
not at all
good now lean back close your eyes
why
i want to make you more comfortable
you do
yes

its okay close your eyes
what are you going to do
just listen to the sound of my voice take a slow deep breath in through your nose and let it out through your mouth just as slowly thats better isnt it
much better oh yes oh yes thats thats much better that is extremely helpful thank you for your time
but
really thats very helpful in through the nose out through the mouth im going to practise that and ill let you know thank you again


i had a very strange visit from one of your officers today
barclay yes i can imagine were you able to do anything for him
to be honest im not sure what happened
where is mister barclay its past fourteen hundred hours
lieutenant barclay report to the bridge lieutenant barclay report
computer locate lieutenant barclay
lieutenant barclay is in holodeck two
ill get him
no ill handle this ive had it with him
counsellor youd better come along

i think you should know barclays been running some unique programs
i dont care what hes been running i just ran out of patience


like i said commander barclays been running some unusual programs
this is a violation of protocol crewmembers should not be simulated in the holodeck
commander i dont think theres any regulation against
well there ought to be computer discontinue programme and erase
computer belay that order
counsellor
if barclay is having difficulty facing reality to suddenly destroy his only means of escape would be brutal and could do considerable damage
they are quite disagreeable arent they shall we have at them
delighted
we shall thrash them
en garde
stop it put that down
your sword sir
i dont have a sword
how do expect to fight without your sword sir
i dont expect to fight
ha do i detect a streak of yellow along the good fellows back perhaps we can supply a more appropriate adversary for him number one
number one
here i come

am i late did i miss the fight en garde you sir you have a familiar bearing is it possible our swords have crossed somewhere before
where is he wheres barclay
ah a personal grudge i warn you it would be wise for you to put your affairs in final order before you meet him in combat you challenge the greatest sword in all the holodeck
you think this is funny
you are very tall it might be threatening to some people
mister barclay will find out what it means to be threatened computer discontinue image of riker
sir you have no sense of fair play
just tell us where to find barclay

you want us to search through all this to find him
it could provide us with valuable information about whats troubling him you know theres nothing wrong with a healthy fantasy life as long as you dont let it take over
you call this healthy
youre taking it so seriously its not without its element of humour
i am the goddess of empathy cast off your inhibitions and embrace love truth joy
oh my god
discard your facades and reveal your true being to me
computer discontinue
computer belay that order we want to get more insight into whats been troubling the poor man remember quite a healthy fantasy life wouldnt you say


report
sir our velocity increased to warp seven point two five
compensating sir
confirmed velocity now warp seven
maintain that what the hell happened
the matterantimatter injectors locked for a split second i am not certain why sir they appear to be working properly now
picard to la forge
go ahead captain
commander any explanation for this injector problem

well im not in engineering sir im in holodeck two
another malfunction
not exactly but ill return to engineering immediately sir

yes i should say you should commander your holodeck activities can wait until later and commander
yes sir
it would be wise to consult lieutenant barclay

on this latest incident
id like to very much captain la forge out we need to find barclay now
cast aside your masks and let me slip into your minds
muzzle it

shh

we have a lot to talk about mister barclay
commander barclay and i had better get to engineering
dismissed

i just couldnt keep my eyes open id worked twelve hours on the power systems and then then the transporter went down
reg you had a chance to get some help from the real counsellor troi but instead you went back in there
i know i didnt want to i just couldnt help myself
youre going to be able to write the book on holodiction look i know how easy it is to get caught up in it i fell in love in there once
really
but i knew when it was time to turn it off and say goodbye it wasnt easy but i did it
you know the people i create in there are more real to me than anyone i meet out here except maybe you commander
i need you out here reg now more than ever

the injectors arent responding to the diagnostic commands
i think we should drop out of warp
la forge to bridge

go ahead commander
recommend we go to impulse power captain
take us out of warp
controls are not responding sir

its the injectors
override
its not a computer problem the mechanism is physically jammed i cant clear it

speed increasing sir warp seven point six seven point six five warp seven point seven

we cant shut it down captain antimatter flow is increasing shes accelerating out of control

theres nothing i can do
approaching warp nine sir
red alert
estimated time to structural failure
at this rate of acceleration fifteen minutes forty seconds sir
did you copy that geordi
aye commander
recommendations

ill let you know as soon as we have some la forge out okay this ship is going to start tearing itself apart in fifteen minutes i want every idea on the table i dont care how outrageous
what about attempting a magnetic quench on the fusion preburners
no i already tried that the magnetic fields wont reset
could the fuel inlet servos be caught in cycle
if they were the swirl dampers would be frozen too and they arent
nothing showed up in the diagnostic sweep at all
the tests showed there were problems i mean no problems with the flow the flow of the
theres nothing wrong with the computer control protocols or the power transfer systems as far as we can determine the injectors are just physically jammed
injectors freeze antigrav unit goes down and transporter malfunctions
and a twisted glass
whats the connection

exceeding warp nine point four
begin evacuation of secondary hull prepare for emergency saucer separation
standing by to release docking clamps
reroute systems to primary hull power sources
the plasma flow to the nacelles is uneven due to injector lock an emergency saucer separation could rupture the warp field

twelve minutes to structural failure sir

none of the systems involved interact directly with each other i dont see anything in common
what if what if what if one of us is the connection
us how
i dont know but were looking for a systemic explanation and there isnt one we work with all the systems that are affected what if were transmitting something ourselves by touching it or something
the computer sensors wouldve picked up anything dangerous
but if it were something something that we couldnt scan you mightve passed it to the injectors when you were realigning the magnetic capacitors
it was your glass duffy and both of you were present in the cargo bay when the antigrav failed
so was obrien
the transporter malfunction thats a connection too
danger approaching safety limits of engine containment field
computer list all physical substances that wouldnt normally be picked up by an internal scan
there are fifteen thousand five hundred twenty five known substances that cannot be detected by standard scans
great and how many of those can exist in an oxygen atmosphere
five hundred thirty two
and could alter molecular structure when it comes in contact with glass
five
on screen at this station duffy
jakmanite has a half life of fifteen seconds there wouldnt be enough time to spread it around the ship
right
selgninaem and lucovexitrin are highly toxic
yeah wed all be dead by now that leaves saltzgadum and invidium neither of which has been used for decades
could either one of them cause all these malfunctions
most of the affected systems werent even invented when those substances were in use who knows what could happen with a transporter or a magnetic capacitor
wait a minute wasnt invidium used in medical containment fields
not for over a century
the mikulaks might still be using it
and one of those canisters was broken
la forge to bridge we have a working theory captain theres a good possibility we picked up some invidium from a broken canister in the cargo bay

and have been spreading it around the ship
working theories are fine geordi

but we need a working solution in about five minutes
understood commander were on our way to cargo bay five for confirmation

nothing on the tricorder
danger exceeding safety limits of engine containment field at current acceleration structural failure will occur in three minutes thirty seconds
if its in there it should show up on one of the polarity channels

there it is
duffy and obrien picked up the broken canister and became contaminated
if we can get it the invidium down to minus two hundred degrees celsius itll become inert
la forge to bridge invidium has been confirmed

recommend we flood the injector pathway conduit with gaseous cryonetrium that ought to neutralise it
the question is will the injectors come back online
they sustained considerable damage captain i cant guarantee that well be able to regain control
we dont have much choice do we
no sir
make it so

route primary coupling through starboard transfer conduit
routing ready for engine core injection
at current acceleration structural failure will occur in forty five seconds

injector conduit temperature minus one hundred degrees celsius
transfer injector control to manual
ready sir temperature now minus one hundred ninety degrees minus two hundred degrees sir
injector status
matter injector is online antimatter injector still locked
at current acceleration structural failure will occur in thirty seconds
cycle power through ventral relay
antimatter injector online reducing flow capacity commencing warp engine shut down sir
stand down from red alert
nice work geordi

mister barclay and i thank you sir
acknowledged
the ship has been seriously contaminated with invidium sir recommend we set course for starbase one two one for a complete systems and biodecontamination
understood picard out
glad you were with us out here in the real world today mister barclay


it has been most difficult to reach this decision to leave you but after thinking about it and discussing it at length with counsellor troi i think its for the best i just wanted to thank you all for your support
youll always be welcome here reg
i know thats why its so difficult to leave
it was a pleasure to serve with you mister barclay
good luck reg
its been fun computer end programme

erase all programs filed under reginald barclay  except programme nine
the most toys

captains log stardate  in order to neutralise a sudden contamination of the water supply at the federation colony on beta agni two we are procuring one hundred and eight kilos of hytritium from the zibalian trader kivas fajo because pure hytritium is too unstable for our transporters lieutenant commander data has been shuttling the material to the enterprise

data to enterprise
go ahead mister data
this will be the last trip sir

the remaining cases of hytritium are now being loaded
acknowledged mister worf advise beta agni two that our departure is imminent
aye captain
at warp six we should be there in just over sixteen hours


loading is complete i am proceeding with departure enterprise shuttlebay two prepare for docking level one precautions for incoming material remain in effect
if youll just acknowledge this last load commander

twenty six point eight kilos of tripolymer composites eleven point eight kilos of molybdenumcobalt alloy one point three kilos bioplast sheeting

shuttle twelve containment field reads nominal now leaving the jovis
on viewer
containment field stable gravitational fluctuations within acceptable parameters flight pattern

data
captains log supplemental as the result of a yet unexplained shuttle explosion lieutenant commander data has been lost

why didnt the containment field hold
unknown commander
hail the jovis i want to speak with kivas fajo
sir mister fajo is hailing us
on viewer
captain picard what happened
its unclear were running a full analysis
we detected no malfunctions before the explosion everything seemed to be running as smoothly as the other flights were you able to save the pilot
no
im sorry
mister fajo i would like to analyse your sensor readings of the explosion
compared to the enterprises our sensors are rather primitive i doubt they contain any information that your sensors overlooked
perhaps but i dont want to leave any avenue unexplored
i understand well transmit the information
link established receiving
can we be of any further assistance
how much hytritium did we manage to bring on board
eighty one kilos
that will barely allow us to complete our mission captain but it leaves us no margin for error
mister fajo i realise we have acquired your complete supply of hytritium do you know where we could obtain some more
that may be difficult the only source i know is in the sigma erani system
three weeks away sir
and i cant guarantee theyll have any for obvious reasons no one wants to keep it around in fact even i may stop selling it its just too dangerous
i guess were fortunate you had any at all sir
captain transfer of information complete
mister fajo thank you for your help

mister crusher set a course for the beta agni two system warp six
aye sir
the grissom is near the sigma erani system ill alert them to stand by in case we need more hytritium
thank you number one
course laid in sir
engage


what am i doing here

wondrous the detail the balance was i not right varria what a remarkable piece of work
why have i been brought here
the voice simulation its perfection the inflections the timing

it took great effort effort to bring you here i was sure hed be worth it i was right
ive been delivered here against my wishes i would like to know the reason
certainly you have been brought here for my enjoyment and my appreciation
am i to infer that you intend to keep me captive
captive captive thats such an inappropriate description my dear android may i call you data
it is my name
data you will be catered to fawned over cared for as you never have been before your every wish will be fulfilled
i wish to leave
almost every wish
this is unacceptable sir i have no desire to remain here and even if i did my starfleet duties would not allow it
its so single minded isnt it
very persistent
but its very polite which is a very nice touch i decline to allow you to go
then i am forced to attempt escape

ten androids just like you might be able to force that thing open but then again there arent any more just like you are there its keyed to galvanic skin responses and dna patterns sorry
then you will have to open it for me

oh really i wouldnt do that again if i were you this is a proximityactuated field it impedes positron flow its very bad for the brainpaths in the long term
i fail to understand the value you place on my presence
well just look around the room there are items her gathered from half the galaxy right here this is the very first basotile ever created  sorry  its very very ancient hundreds of years old its priceless

come this vase is made by mark the late mark offzel from sirrie four  dali this is the only known roger maris trading card from earth circa  the smell bubblegum ive preserved the scent what a lapling

i thought they were extinct
extinct good that is what is generally believed she is the last surviving member of her species theyre very defenseless creatures really everything that you see in the room here everything one of its kind unique all original just as you are there  that is your place of honour sit sit sit you think perhaps it might be uncomfortable but then again you dont give a thought to comfort do you  when palor toff learns of that hell swallow his tongue with envy i cant wait to see his face you are the crown jewel of my collection youre a treasure beyond comparison

yes go ahead
i think you should be flattered
i am not sir most intelligent lifeforms find involuntary confinement offensive and inequitable moreover you have violated federation law
i know i know what ive done is evil selfish immoral unprincipled illegal well ive learned to live with it
the andorians wish to make a bid on the shipment of tellurian spices you offered
theyve had four days to decide why do they have to decide right sorry
i must emphasize mister fajo that i consider this captivity a hostile act on your part
youll get used to it

i cant believe hes gone
i always thought hed outlive us by centuries

hed been working on this for months he never felt it was quite finished
you know what a critic data was especially about his own work

that was a gift from the captain
and he should have it back

those should go to commander riker
data always fell for rikers bluffs

these are some of starfleets highest honours
not bad for a walking pile of circuitry and memory cells

you know i keep going over and over the accident in my mind trying to figure out what went wrong i can see data in the shuttle almost like im sitting there next to him going through the departure sequence what the hell happened why didnt i see it coming what am i missing

kivas wishes you to wear this set of clothes and to sit in your chair
i have no reason to accede to mister fajos wishes
he will give you reasons if you force him to
mister fajo is deluding himself if he believes he can keep me here the enterprise is certain to find me
theyre not even looking for you they think youre destroyed your shuttle blew up a hytritium explosion
they will scan the debris and discover i was not aboard
theyll find exactly what they thought theyd find traces of your component elements we put them aboard the shuttle in just the right proportions
clearly mister fajo has no moral difficulty with my imprisonment here
mister fajo has no moral difficulties at all
do you
clever android is it part of your programme to seek out vulnerabilities in your enemies
yes are you my enemy
i obey fajo and so does everyone on this ship
why
you are a curious thing arent you
do you object to the question
kivas finds a way to get what he wants from his people his rewards for loyalty are lavish his punishments for disloyalty are equally lavish you wont find anyone here on this ship to help you escape face it android he has you
it appears he has us both

the reason i cant find anything is that theres nothing there to find ive run this analysis dozens of times over and theres just no indication of any malfunction
no possible explanation at all
yeah theres one but i dont believe it pilot error
i know its hard to accept but even the best
captain its not only hard to accept with data its impossible i mean i cant even begin to calculate the odds if data were here we could ask him
what are you suggesting lieutenant
i dont know sir it just doesnt make sense and i like things to make sense thats all
geordi maybe if you get a little rest and came at this thing fresh
a little rest isnt going to change the computer analysis commander
im sure you have done a complete investigation and if you wish to continue it of course you have my support but we shall be reaching the beta agni system shortly and i expect you to be rested
i understand sir
dismissed geordi i understand how much we want even need to explain an accident like this sometimes there just arent any explanations

for an android with no feelings he sure managed to evoke them in others
we must select an officer to replace data at ops recommendations
worf would be my first choice sir
mine as well make it so


he was a man taken for all in all i shall not look upon his like again


you are still wearing that uniform why
i am a starfleet officer
you are not in starfleet any longer its time you adjusted your programme to accept reality
even if i chose to do so it is doubtful that my programming could be sufficiently altered to accede to your wishes
oh
i have been designed with a fundamental respect for life in all its forms and a strong inhibition against causing harm to living beings
what a marvellous contradiction a military pacifist tell me whose dreadful decision was it to enlist you in starfleet to begin with
my skills seemed appropriate
data data data big mistake a grievous error you belong in starfleet about as much as i belong in a verbal contract tell me have you killed yet
no but i am programmed with the ability to use deadly force in the cause of defense
shame on you shame on you how neatly you rationalise your capabilities how can you just casually accept your role in murder
i would not participate in murder perhaps you misunderstand
cant you see how much better it will be for you right here the intellectual rewards alone our personal exploration of the galaxy i am at war with no one i am your liberator
you are a fine debater sir it is a pity you have used your verbal gifts for mere hucksterism and the advancement of your own greed
perhaps perhaps you would not judge me so harshly if you knew of my desperate youth wasted wasted on the streets of zimballia
your past does not excuse unethical or immoral behaviour sir
well it doesnt matter it isnt true anyway my father was quite wealthy actually he was a thief data why dont you put on these lovely new clothes and sit on the chair
i must decline
you are going to be much more of a challenge than i had first thought  finoplak one hundred denkirs  now data in the meantime here is something for your logic circuits to analyse

oh dont worry the solvent wont harm your your skin but in seconds it will completely dissolve that uniform personally id be delighted to see you go around naked i assume you have no modesty but then i guess that decency is the rule of your starfleet training in any case data why dont you make a decision about which alternative you dislike the least make a decision by dinnertime tonight i have invited a guest to meet you and i expect you to be as entertaining with him as you have been with me


proceeding with departure enterprise shuttlebay two prepare for docking level one precautions remain in effect
i did miss something


 see you later  your first watch at ops
i have served at the position before
ive been concerned about you
about me why
because i know how id feel if i was asked to replace data at his station

bridge promotion due to the death of a crewmate is commonplace on klingon ships
i know but this isnt a klingon ship and data was your friend and its the second time youve replaced a crewmate whos died
i honour datas memory as i did lieutenant yars by attempting to perform their duties as well as they did
in true klingon fashion
i appreciate your concern

computer now replay shuttle audio transmission time index zero four two three this is datas second trip
proceeding with departure enterprise shuttlebay two prepare for docking level one precautions remain in effect shuttle has cleared the jovis cargo bay
sounds just like the first trip
exactly the same thats protocol and thats data following protocol to the letter okay computer now replay shuttle audio transmission time index zero four three nine third and final trip
loading is complete i am proceeding with departure enterprise shuttlebay two prepare for docking level one precautions remain in effect
thats it thats the last communication
he didnt report the shuttle clearing the cargo bay of the jovis
of course there really wasnt any reason for him to make voice contact he knew wed be monitoring his position any other pilot might not bother but data not following standard procedures
what do you think it means
im not sure wes i suppose he couldve been too busy maybe he saw something was wrong
without communicating it that doesnt sound like data either
which means maybe something was wrong with him but theres no other indication of that nothing he said or did during the entire mission none i sure wish i could talk to the last people who saw him alive


ive added a veltan sex idol to my collection
ive got four of them
what with the pearls intact
please pearls were added by the ferengi agents to increase the value
what is that something new and you didnt tell me
mister data im delighted to see that you dressed for the occasion say hello to my very good friend palor toff

data say hello no need to be shy
its a mannequin of some sort
this is not a mannequin this is data this is formerly lieutenant commander data of the federation starfleet the only sentient android in existence
it doesnt seem particularly sentient right now
thats because its playing a stupid little game with us
well someone has certainly played a game on you fajo
i dont find this amusing i demand that you behave normally behave normally i know you can hear me

he falls well
i apologize for this
do not be upset my friend im having a delightful visit come along varria youre much more fun to play with than fajos new toy
 youll regret this

now entering the beta agni system sir
take us to half impulse mister crusher
la forge to bridge
go ahead commander
captain

a class two probe has been loaded with the hytritium compound and is ready to launch

now approaching beta agni two sir
mister crusher put us into close orbit mister data scan my apologies mister worf scan the colonys subsurface water
scanning tricyanate contamination confirmed levels approaching forty two parts per million
area affected
thirty square kilometres
any indication of the source
highest concentration eight kilometres west of the colony
adjust target coordinates
aye sir
la forge to bridge

according to these figures the eighty one kilos

of hytritium should be enough to neutralise the contamination
now approaching target coordinates
launch probe
probe on target hytritium entering water table disbursement slightly faster than expected sir something unusual
specify
im getting concentrated tricyanate readings of seventy grams per cubic centimetre at the source coordinates much higher than would normally occur
computer report on geologic instability on beta agni two
no significant geological activity has been recorded on beta agni two since the settlement of the federation colony
number one perhaps youd better take an away team down and have a closer look
yes sir doctor crusher join me in transporter room three
on my way
mister worf


i would very much like our relationship to change
you may expect me to use every means at my disposal to resist your wishes
why cant you just comply why do you argue all the time couldnt you just go sit on the chair come on go on sit on the chair
i do not intend to sit in the chair
you will you may believe it right now but you will

have you ever seen one of these data
it is a disruptor
well no its a prototype for a varont disruptor
the varont disruptor is banned in the federation
oh yes they only manufactured five of them i own four i sleep with one under my pillow at night and i sleep very well knowing its there too do you know why
it is a most lethal weapon
its not just lethal its vicious it tears a body apart inside out and very slowly too by your phaser standards its tortuous a very very painful death ive always wanted to try this
it is doubtful you will destroy me since you assign so much value to possessing me
that goes without saying please come in

varria how long have we been together my dear
fourteen years
fourteen wonderful years they were too she was barely an adult when i found her she was idealistic naive full of dreams and i made those dreams come true too didnt i im going to miss you

fajo



the contaminations been neutralised the waters clean
curious the process of neutralisation should have taken several hours naturally occurring tricyanate does not respond this quickly
are you saying its not naturally occurring
there are no natural trace elements present in these tricyanate crystals
if its artificial then were talking about sabotage
with tricyanate thats hard to believe its slow to assimilate difficult to replicate and hard to transport there are a lot easier ways to poison a water supply more effective ways too
can you think of any reason a saboteur would choose tricyanate
it might pass for a natural disaster and since theres only one way to treat it with hytritium maybe somebody figured we couldnt locate it it is hard to find
then it really was lucky wasnt it that we were able to find hytritium when we did and just enough hytritium for this crisis

fajo was in the right place at the right time just when we needed him most
youre suggesting he created the problem just to solve it
possibly
what to make a profit from his sale of hytritium
it doesnt add up the cost of producing tricyanate is very expensive he wouldnt make a profit on it quite the contrary
then why would he do it
what could he want
computer biographical file on trader kivas fajo
accessing file kivas fajo a zibalian trader of the stacius trade guild educated on iraaten five a noted collector of rare and valuable objects including the rejac crystal the starry night by van gogh the lawmim galactopedia the moliam andi tapestries
computer that is sufficient
a rare and valuable object
what if data wasnt on that shuttle
mister crusher
aye sir
set course for the site of the shuttlepod explosion warp eight
aye sir

the jovis has a maximum speed of warp three hes had twenty three hours so we can define a perimeter of point one oh two light years as his possible distance
fajo doesnt know that were onto him so he probably isnt taxing his engines at top speed
he could have made it to the nel bato system or maybe even the giles belt
hes a trader he doesnt attract customers by being hard to find
we could put out a coded level two query to all federation outposts within the perimeter
make it so


if i help you escape will you take me with you hes sleeping and there isnt much time
the consequences if we are caught
i know the consequences fourteen years you learn a few things theres an escape pod in the aft cargo bay


captain affirmative response from station lya four
fajo spent more than half a day in orbit departed just over seven hours ago
mister crusher new coordinates lay in a course for lya four
coordinates already laid in sir

perhaps i should attempt to communicate with the enterprise
you cant fajo has communications access restricted to the bridge once were out the shuttlepod will emit an emergency beacon well just have to hope somebody responds before fajo is able to destroy us
i am trained in evasive manoeuvres
well need a few lets get going as soon as i start the escape sequence an alarm will sound we wont have much time

its your fault you knew the price for disobedience and so did she well theres always another varria

you wont hurt me fundamental respect for all living beings that is what you said im a living being therefore you cant harm me
you will surrender yourself to the authorities
or what youll fire empty threat and we both know it why dont you accept your fate you will return to your chair and you will sit there you will entertain me and you will entertain my guests and if you do not i will simply kill somebody else him perhaps it doesnt matter their blood will be on your hands too just like poor varrias your only alternative data is to fire murder me thats all you have to do go ahead fire if only you could feel rage over varrias death if only you could feel the need for revenge then maybe you could fire but youre just an android you cant feel anything can you its just another interesting intellectual puzzle for you another of lifes curiosities
i cannot permit this to continue

wait your programme wont allow you to fire you cannot fire no


im reading a weapon in transit with commander data it seems to have discharged sir
discharged
im deactivating it
welcome back mister data are you all right
yes commander please arrange to take kivas fajo into custody on charges of murder kidnapping theft
the arrangements have already been made
a varont disruptor it belongs to fajo
mister obrien says the weapon was in a state of discharge
perhaps something occurred during transport commander

oh have you come to see me to repent is this your final satisfaction want to see me beg for mercy youre not going to get any of that from me
i expected nothing
our roles are reversed arent they data youre the collector now me im in a cage
so it seems
just dont count me out too quickly i had you in my collection once i can have you there again
unlikely sir your collection has been confiscated all of your stolen possessions are being returned to their rightful owners you have lost everything you value
it must give you great pleasure
no sir it does not i do not feel pleasure i am only an android
sarek

captains log stardate  the enterprise has been given the singular honour of hosting the first meeting between the federation and a mysterious race known as the legarans we are in orbit around vulcan preparing to welcome aboard federation ambassador sarek and his wife perrin who like his first wife is from earth

i remember studying his career in school the treaty of alpha cygnus nine the coridan admission to the federation the klingon alliance
i met him once many years ago very briefly at his sons wedding i can tell you that was quite a moment for a young lieutenant standing in the presence of such history i remember he spoke to me and i just stood there grinning like an idiot
you tonguetied
indeed how do you make small talk with someone who shaped the federation
is it true that hell be retiring after this mission
unofficially thats what i hear what a crowning achievement for his career the benefits of relations with the legarans are incalculable


ah captain picard i am ki mendrossen the ambassadors chief of staff this is sakkath his personal assistant
has the ambassador been delayed
he will be joining us momentarily but first we must discuss some matters of the utmost delicacy
please go ahead
to be frank captain the ambassador is not a young man he tires easily
hes going to need a lot of rest to prepare himself for the difficult job that awaits him
which is why it is imperative that he be allowed to conserve his strength i must request that you dispense with any formal activities normally associated with a visitor of his rank
we had planned a ships concert this evening
i believe the ambassador is extremely fond of mozart
im afraid it would be impossible for him to attend upon his arrival he will be taken directly to his quarters where he will remain in seclusion until we reach legara four
you have my assurance that the ambassador will not be disturbed during the voyage
thats all we ask well now thats settled the ambassador is waiting

welcome aboard the enterprise ambassador sarek
we come to serve
your service honours us
allow me to present she who is my wife
mrs sarek
please call me perrin captain
this is my first officer commander william riker
captain would you be so kind as to show us to our quarters
i prefer to view the conference room first
ambassador im sure sakkath and i can handle all the necessary details
i will examine it for myself
perhaps it would be best if we settled in first
they worry about my health captain too much you will take me to the conference room please
if youll follow me sir


are the legarans really going to sit in this stuff
well im sure not
can you believe this smell
what smell what can i say to us its a slime pit but to them its home
okay the environmental controls are ready whats next
what are you in some kind of hurry or something
yeah i have a date
a date with who
ensign dumont
really shes very attractive ive got to admit wes im a bit surprised
what that shed go out with me
no that youd actually have the nerve to ask her way to go

the room is not ready
no ambassador commander la forge and ensign crusher are
the legarans are very sensitive in matters of protocol you will remove all the furniture from the room the walls must be bare
im sure everything will be set up according to our specifications before the legarans arrive isnt that right captain
i assure you ambassador everything will be ready before the conference begins
my husband and i have every confidence in you captain
i have worked for ninety three years in preparation for this meeting it is vital that no detail be overlooked
perhaps we should allow these gentlemen to return to their work ambassador
that will be acceptable these walls are too bright

the way mendrossen described him i expected to see a frail old man
i hope im that frail when im two hundred and two years old but his aides did seem to be a little overprotective didnt they
from what i could see the ambassador doesnt need to be protected from anything
well well respect mister mendrossens request and allow ambassador sarek his privacy i suppose they were foolish and vain my expectations of this voyage sharing his thoughts memories his unique understanding of the history hes made
does this mean youre going to cancel the concert this evening
no the concert will ahead as scheduled but its a pity that the guest of honour will be absent
for all we know the ambassador might enjoy an evenings entertainment
why not ask his wife if shed like to attend
thats an excellent idea counsellor you have the bridge number one

come in
i hope im not intruding
not at all captain but sarek is in meditation at the moment
actually i came to see you
well how nice i so rarely get visitors of my own usually everyone wants to see the ambassador
i find that hard to believe thank you

these quarters are quite comfortable the ambassador and i were very pleased when we heard that the negotiations were going to take place aboard the flagship of the federation
the honour is ours
my husband has taken an interest in your career he finds it to be satisfactory
my word high praise from a vulcan
some people who expect an emotional response often find vulcans quite cold when they are merely being
logical
exactly
i came to invite you and your husband if he is available to a mozart recital this evening
what a tempting offer i doubt that the ambassador will be able to attend but i will make it a point to ask him
well then i hope to see you tonight
as do i

you are still unable to meditate
it is of no importance
it has eluded you for many weeks
i said it is of no importance
you know i am right
my wife you will leave me now i require solitude

the temperature in the tank is now one hundred fifty degrees celsius
okay lock it off
is that it can i get out of here now
whats your hurry you dont really think somethings going to happen with suzanne dumont do you
at least im not spending the night with a good book like some people
whats that supposed to mean
just what it sounds like
let me tell you something youd get more action out of a good book than youll ever see on this date ill guarantee it shes not going to waste her time on someone like you
someone like me
shes way out of your league
since when did you become an expert on women
compared to you every male on this ship is an expert on women
well at least i dont have to find my women on the holodeck
what did you say
you heard me
yeah i heard you just what do you think is going to stop
something wrong i asked a question
no sir nothing wrong here
may i be excused commander

anything youd like to talk about geordi
no sir


i noticed that lieutenant worf put ensign damato on report for insubordination
damatos been an exemplary officer
indeed he has would you look into it number one
of course

good evening
good evening
i assume the work is progressing on the conference room
yes i checked in with wesley and geordi a few hours ago there was a moment when i actually thought that the two of them were going to hit one each other

ambassador sarek perrin on behalf of the entire crew welcome
it was my wifes suggestion that we attend it seemed an ideal diversion perrin can be quite logical when she so chooses
it seems that the ambassador had more free time than i anticipated
commander data will be our featured soloist this evening
i have been programmed to reproduce the individual musical styles of over three hundred concert violinists including heifetz menuhin graktay and tataglia do you have a preference
tataglia would be lovely
i hope you find the performance pleasing
i look forward to it
at your convenience mister data please


hi mom i got a message you wanted to see me
i thought you were going to be at the concert last night
i said i may be going suzanne wanted to go to the arboretum
captain picard asked me where you were i dont like making excuses for you
excuses come on mom it wasnt an official function
listen young man you have responsibilities and i want you to live up to them
dont you think youre overreacting a little
dont talk back to me
okay i wont
where do you think youre going
away from you


and then i just slapped him really hard i slapped wesley
do you know why you did it
ive never hit my son in his life
beverly this is important what were you thinking when you hit wes
i wasnt thinking about anything i was just angry
and wesley didnt provoke you in any way it wasnt anything he said or anything he did
no thats just it it was a sudden burst of anger i still cant believe i did it
i dont know why you did it either but i can tell you that ive heard the same kind of story from ten different people over the last two days

this is your command centre
yes it is normally occupied by captain picard commander riker and counsellor troi
counsellor troi is a betazoid
halfbetazoid her father was human
then she is not a true telepath
her skills are empathic in nature she is able to sense the emotions of other beings
what is captain picards background in diplomacy
extensive the captains first diplomatic contact dates back to
and what of his knowledge of the legarans would he be able to conduct negotiations with them should the need arise
do you foresee such a circumstance occurring is ambassador sarek unable to
forgive me i was merely exploring various possible permutations of our mission your tour of the bridge has been most informative


excuse me we were sitting here
well were sitting here now
come on fella this is our table
really funny i dont see your name on it
didnt your mother teach you manners

hey hey guys is there some kind of problem here
there seems to be a question of whos table this is
there are plenty of other tables right
i suppose youre right
why dont i get everyone another round of drinks all right

i dont need to tell you that insubordination is a serious charge to level against any officer
i am aware of that commander however ensign damato directly challenged my authority
is it my imagination or have tempers become a little frayed on this ship lately
i hadnt noticed


i see what you mean

security team to ten forward
geordi what the hell is going on here
i wish i knew
all right thats enough


the next thing i know somebodys left hook is on its way to my chin
captain this is not an isolated incident there have been reports of random violence all over the ship
are you suggesting this is somehow contagious
theres no indication of any bacteria or virus ive run every test i know ive checked the water food replicators airborne samples
this is a hell of a time whatever it is i dont want it to affect the ambassador i want his quarters isolated from the rest of the crew until weve identified the cause
its not that simple captain
we have determined that the outbreak of violence started at virtually the same time sarek and his party beamed onto the ship

we do have a working theory we believe that its possible ambassador sarek himself is responsible for these incidents
sarek
i felt something during the concert vague and undefined but very disturbing
he cried i saw that i couldnt believe it a vulcan moved to tears by music its
well vulcans have the same basic emotions we do theyve just learned to repress them what i sensed during the concert was that hed lost control
what would cause such a loss of control
theres a very rare condition that sometimes affects vulcans over the age of two hundred bendii syndrome its early symptoms include sudden bursts of emotion mostly irrational anger eventually all emotional control is lost
i can imagine nothing that would be more offensive to a vulcan their emotional detachment is the very core of their being how would this affect others on board the ship
vulcans possess telepathic ability sarek may unintentionally be projecting intense emotions onto other people at random
and when the legarans beam on board
they could very well be affected too
is there a treatment
cant someone else take his place
sarek has built a personal relationship with them they will accept no one else how can we confirm your diagnosis
we can grow a culture from the tissue of the metathalamus but the results will take several days
i have twelve hours

thats impossible captain picard i cannot delay the conference not for a day not for an hour the schedule itself required three months of negotiations
nevertheless we appear to be facing
i give you my word of honour that the ambassador is in perfect health is that enough
mister mendrossen
you are dealing with a theory full of holes captain why am i not affected by sareks supposed condition and perrin how could his wife function normally if this theory of yours is correct
i cannot explain that hundreds of others on board have not been affected either i have not it appears to be random proximity apparently has no bearing on the phenomenon
you are accusing the greatest man of his time of losing his mind on the eve of his greatest triumph and you cannot explain why i wont report this to the ambassador for the moment i dont want to divert his attention from the mission but if i were you in the interests of your career id be very concerned about finding the real cause of these outbursts before the legarans arrive

mister data will you please report to my ready room
aye sir

captain picard is not satisfied with ki mendrossens assurances that the ambassador is in good health do you consider sarek capable of carrying out his mission
have i given you cause to think otherwise
you have voiced certain reservations to me about his abilities
i do not recall making such a statement
not directly no but you did question me about the diplomatic capabilities of both captain picard and counsellor troi
i am honourbound to help sarek carry out this mission that is the only answer i can give
then you must decide which is your greater obligation your loyalty to sarek or your duty to the federation can you accept the logic of continuing this mission
tell your captain the mission is in jeopardy

sakkath has been able until recently to use his telepathic skills to reinforce sareks emotional control thus protecting others from the effects of his deterioration
he hasnt been doing a very good job
the strain of this mission on sarek has made it impossible
its ironic isnt it all this magnificent technology and we find ourselves still susceptible to the ravages of old age the loss of dignity the slow betrayal of our bodies by forces we cannot master do you still want to be one of us data
sir it is conceivable even for me that time will eventually lead to irreparable circuit failure but there is one thing i do not understand sarek is a logical intelligent being the effects of bendii syndrome are apparent why would such a man choose to ignore them
logic fails us sometimes data i think this is one of those times i can only guess that he does not see or he does not wish to see the truth and he is being insulated against that truth by those who love him most
someone has to confront him
not a task that im looking forward to
i dont understand this everyone is protecting sarek his wife mendrossen even you
what would you have me do march down there and destroy the man
the mission with the legarans cannot be carried out with sarek in this condition
i know that
 then tell him that there is no way
dont you tell me what to do
captain commander
of course youre right number one its a task that i will attend to

captain i dont think i understand what youre telling me my husband is responsible for your crew assaulting one another
he is very ill perrin
bendii syndrome is more a folk tale than a disease there hasnt been a true case of it in my husbands lifetime
theres one now sakkath knows
sakkath sakkath knows nothing my husband didnt teach him
he knows and more than that on this mission he has been consciously holding sareks mind together as well as he could
that is not true
i must see sarek
captain i know a good deal about the vulcan mind and i know a good deal about the heart of one particular vulcan i am his wife and he is fine he does not have bendii syndrome and that shall be the end of it
im sorry
please you must not do this to him

must not do what my wife if captain picard wishes to see me he may do so i regret that we have seen so little of each other during this voyage captain
the loss is mine ambassador
captain may i talk with you in private
you were speaking of your belief that i suffer from bendii syndrome i have been accused of many things in my life never an excess of emotion
sarek i see no reason to continue this discussion
on the contrary i wish to assuage any fears the captain may have regarding my capabilities i believe there is a test for bendii syndrome i will take it immediately
unfortunately the results would not be available for several days which is why i must ask for a postponement of the conference
that would be a mistake captain i give you my word i am in perfect health
then why must sakkath help to contain your emotions
is what the captain says true
no ambassador absolutely not
perrin were you aware of this sakkath i await an answer
i have been using my limited abilities to strengthen your mental discipline
your efforts will no longer be required
that would not be wise
it may not be wise but it is necessary

leave me i wish to speak with captain picard
sarek i ask you to reconsider
obey my wishes there is nothing to fear

i hope ive not embarrassed you ambassador
you seem to forget captain that i am a vulcan i am not affected by emotional considerations
i think you are affected sir far more than you realise
i am a logical being present your arguments i will listen
there is an epidemic of violent incidents aboard the enterprise as we speak the situation is worsening
and it is your hypothesis that i am the cause of these incidents
yes my chief medical officer has explored all other probable causes
i share your concern for your crew however you must agree it is not unusual for a starship to encounter unexplained phenomena
that is correct
therefore since i can assure you that i am not the cause of your difficulties the logical course would be to have your doctor to continue her search
she is it is also a fact that these incidents began shortly after your arrival
is your entire argument to be based on mere coincidence
is it also coincidence that your wife and chief of staff are carefully isolating you
ah i believe i see the flaw in your logic you are reacting to their overprotective attitudes towards me they are both somewhat emotional concerning my age
surely sakkath cannot be influenced by emotion
am i to be blamed for the judgment of a child sakkath is young and inexperienced he erred in his assumption that i needed help
but you needed his help at the concert or is there possibly some other logical explanation for what happened that night
what happened
i saw you crying
i do not cry
i was there i saw the tears
you exaggerate captain i recall only one tear
so you were emotionally affected by the music
that is not possible
you still havent answered my question sarek is it logical for a vulcan to cry
it was late i was fatigued nothing more the legarans trust only me they will not meet with any other member of the federation i must be allowed to complete my mission there are no other logical solutions
no other logical solutions but ambassador there are always other solutions you have said so yourself many times
what i meant was that
sarek of vulcan would never be afraid of looking straight at something he did not want to see
i warn you your efforts to discredit me will not succeed
sarek of vulcan never confused what he wanted with the truth
i will not be spoken to in this manner
do i hear anger in your voice
it would be illogical for a vulcan to show anger it would be illogical illogical illogical illogical
captains log supplemental in three hours time we are scheduled to meet with the legaran delegation however it is now all too evident that ambassador sarek is in no condition to proceed with the conference

were entering the legaran system sir shall i have mister worf contact their ambassador
no i will present our regrets to the legarans personally it is vital that they understand our reasons for cancelling these negotiations
captain i think you did the right thing
but at what cost number one

come perrin
i must speak with you captain
ill be on the bridge sir

how is the ambassador
resting ive come to ask you to reconsider your position
you know that is impossible
sarek is a good man hes given the federation a lifetime of service i beg you to let him keep the respect he has earned
hell never lose that respect
mendrossen and i never wanted to deceive you my husbands condition came on him so gradually it was so easy to delude ourselves and pretend that nothing was wrong we convinced ourselves that he could complete this one last task and end his career with dignity help him captain help him regain his pride his honour
believe me it would give me great pleasure but there is nothing i can do
the mission can be saved but he needs your help to do it

a mindmeld between the two of us do you realise the dangers involved in what you are proposing captain
yes i do ambassador but i also realise the potential benefits
we would be linked telepathically sharing our thoughts becoming in essence one mind
which for a few hours should provide the emotional control you need in that time you can meet with the legarans and conclude the treaty
it is a generous offer but i must warn you that while i would gain your stability you would experience the fierce onslaught of emotions unleashed by my condition vulcan emotions are extremely intense we have learned to suppress them no human would be able to control them they would overwhelm you the mindmeld can be a terrible intimacy i cannot allow it
im aware of the risks but it is the only logical solution
your courage honours me captain

i cant say i approve of this jeanluc
i didnt expect that you would beverly
i dont suppose i could talk you out of it
im afraid not though i do admit to a certain trepidation your company is much appreciated

come
i see that you are ready captain
doctor crusher will monitor our responses
a sensible precaution

my mind to your mind your thoughts to my thoughts

commander the legarans are ready to beam aboard
very well
number one please inform the legaran delegation that sarek of vulcan is on his way to welcome them
yes ambassador

i take it the mindmeld was a success
yes all went as planned
is captain picard all right
dont worry number one
and the ambassador
i am myself again it has been a long time


no it is wrong it is wrong a lifetime of discipline washed away and in its place bedlam bedlam i am so old there is nothing left but dry bones and dead friends tired oh so tired
it will pass all of it just another hour or so youre doing fine just hold on
no this weakness disgusts me i hate it where is my logic i am betrayed by desires i want to feel i want to feel everything but i am a vulcan i must feel nothing give me back my control
jeanluc
perrin amanda i wanted to give you so much more i wanted to show you such tenderness but that is not our way spock amanda did you know perrin can you know how much i love you i do love you

beverly
im here jeanluc im not going anywhere
its quite difficult the anguish of the man the despair pouring out of him all those feelings the regrets i cant stop them

i cant stop them i cant i cant
dont even try
first officers log stardate  ambassador sarek has successfully concluded the negotiations with the legarans the uss merrimac has arrived and will transport the ambassador and his party back to vulcan

i hope your journey aboard the merrimac will be uneventful
with the pressures of the conference behind him i believe i can help maintain his control until we return to vulcan
what will happen to him then
the effects of bendii syndrome are irreversible medical research is always continuing of course
mister obrien stand by for transport
aye sir
thank you captain
he loves you very much
i know i have always known

i will take my leave of you now captain i do not think we shall meet again
i hope you are wrong ambassador
we shall always retain the best part of the other inside us
i believe i have the best part of that bargain ambassador peace and long life
live long and prosper

mnage a troi

captains log stardate  the enterprise has been in attendance at the biennial trade agreements conference on betazed for the first time the ferengi are present and i have reluctantly consented to their boarding the enterprise for the closing reception


check and mate
perfect the queens gambit finished off with the aldabren exchange
that is unfair i couldnt concentrate with all that noise
noise its algolian ceremonial rhythms
a toast to the success of the trade conference reittan i must admit i had some doubts when you invited the ferengi
they made a profit and behaved themselves what more could one ask still they trouble me we betazeds are uncomfortable with species like the ferengi whose minds we cant read
perhaps your telepathic abilities are ineffective owing to the anomalous construction of the ferengi brain which is composed of four different
thank you mister data it was thoughtful of you to invite lwaxana troi to be part of the betazed delegation
yes lwaxana and i go way back her first husband and i were old friends and ive known deanna since she was a child
im sure counsellor troi appreciates the opportunity to spend time with her mother
 little one you could at least pretend youre happy to see me
mother were among nontelepaths its impolite not to speak aloud
you mean talk with my mouth full deanna please
all right you want me to say something aloud have you considered if you had stayed on betazed you might have been a happier person
lets not guess what might have been i love my work aboard the enterprise
yes of course you do but its all business and no play youve got to enjoy life relax like i do find yourself the right man think of your future think of my future
lwaxana deanna anything i can do for you
 could i

shes as repulsive as the rest of them

repulsive i find her exotic and what an advantage her telepathy would be in our negotiations
to read our competitors minds yes that would be valuable but shed never agree to use her powers to help us
im not so sure

lwaxana troi of betazed i believe i am daimon tog of the ferengi vessel krayton may i join you
i was just going to see captain picard excuse me

oh jeanluc jeanluc come have a drink with me tell me what youve been up to
perhaps later lwaxana mister data and i were just about to show reittan grax the er the er the new door mechanisms on the aft turbolifts if youll excuse us
lwaxana troi i desire you
what
you see your betazoid skills would be very useful to me and i find you very attractive i am willing to pay handsomely for you
i dont believe this
you must be aware that every female has her price
lets get one thing straight little man i am not for sale and if by some chance i were to become available i would rather eat orion wingslugs than deal with a toadfaced troll like you so go away and find someone else to become your property

as you wish
now that youve totally humiliated us may we return to our vessel
she is exhilarating isnt she now i want her more than ever lwaxana troi you will be mine

are we at war with the ferengi yet
daimon tog has returned to his vessel and the ferengi have left orbit
my mother will be relieved
i hear she handled the situation quite skillfully an admirable woman
ill be sure to tell her you said so
come in little one


mother mother please
after that awful little ferengi insulted me i needed to centre myself can you imagine that dreadful little creature talking to me like that doesnt he realise that i am a daughter of the fifth house of betazed holder of the sacred chalice of rixx
the sacred chalice of rixx is an old clay pot with mold growing inside it
perhaps one day when youre older and wiser youll understand come on sit down talk to me we spend so little time together
thats true im sorry and i didnt mean to get so upset with you at the reception
deanna try to understand youre all i have my only concern is for your happiness
i am happy why cant you believe that
i wish i could but how much happiness is there in always being there for someone else and never being there for yourself
i get a great deal of satisfaction out of my work
im sure you do im sure its very rewarding in its way what about a family
this is my family my friends here on the enterprise
all right in case i have to spell it out for you im talking about finding a husband having a child thats what made me happy at least until now
mother look perhaps some day i will marry but youve got to let me make my own choices live my own life and not the life you would choose for me
you had your chance with commander riker look how you ruined that
i did not ruin anything weve became very good friends
well all the better you certainly wouldnt want to marry an enemy i see we cant talk about this very well have it your way little one
little one you called me that when i was five now stop demeaning me and address me as an adult

ill be home on betazed if you need me little deanna

adding preprocessors to the neutrino counters boosted efficiency by eleven percent of course commander la forge and commander data did most of the work
not so fast wesley preprocessing the data with an optical chip was your idea
that is correct sir although commander la forge and i designed the chip mister crusher derived the equation governing its operation
the point is youve completed the upgrade well ahead of schedule very impressive
indeed fine work we shall miss you mister crusher as youve guessed final entrance examination scores from starfleet academy have arrived congratulations as soon as you have completed the oral exam youll be formally admitted
well have you back at betazed in plenty of time to meet up with the academy transport ship
thank you sir
thatll be all number one a moment

yes captain
youll agree that this is a fairly routine mapping mission
yes sir
counsellor troi had the good sense to ask for shore leave i can see im going to have to suggest it to you have a good time number one


i think its around here somewhere
maybe it died it has been a few years
muktok live for hundreds of years here it is

its lovely i remember that sound and all the good times we had
i remember a certain junior officer meeting a very serious psychologist the best part about being assigned to betazed

oh this is the perfect spot put the food down over there mister homn isnt it a beautiful day for a picnic theyll join us in a minute no no no no here put the food over there no you can go back
mother how did you know about this place
your father used to bring me here sit down
and you even brought provisions very thoughtful
here will deanna try an oskoid theyre delicious that sap running through the veins helps keep it warm
very tasty so tell us lwaxana the last time we met you were looking for a husband did you have any luck
alas no but what happens to me isnt important im much more concerned about other people getting on with their lives
mother
mister homn i noticed some uttaberries back along the path pick some

well mister homn and i could go back home if you two would like to be alone its such a romantic setting
mother stop it
darling you have been so excitable lately have you ever thought of a leave of absence i could talk to jeanluc
try the oskoid very different

what the
for one whose beauty surpasses even these pericules
daimon tog i thought the krayton left orbit hours ago
it did but when i tried to get the image of lwaxana troi out of my mind i could not succeed
this is ludicrous you mean you came all the way back to betazed for me
why continue to search for perfection once you have found it
i dont believe this
look demon tog or whatever you call yourself i am the daughter of the fifth house holder of the sacred chalice of rixx heir to the holy rings of betazed and unless you want to create an interstellar incident you had better beam back to your ship
returning to my ship is exactly what i had in mind krayton transport four immediately
no tog



lwaxana deanna
where are we
from the smell of things id say were aboard a ferengi vessel
the ferengi cant do that youre starfleet officers
tog must have missed that chapter in the ferengi book of etiquette  enterprise must be too far out of range

daimon they have regained consciousness
very good


i should have known even their transporters cant be trusted
why have you removed our clothing
females do not deserve the honour of clothing
theyre as bad as humans look at the leer on his face
no his is an expression of revulsion but it is a feeling that i do not share lwaxana

well its cold in here do you want me to become ill
you must forgive the doctor he is not accustomed to dealing with betazoid females now lwaxana i have a business proposition for you
thanks but im not interested in any of your propositions
hear me out your telepathic powers could bring us both great profit
huh why would i want to bring you profit
in order to keep your daughter alive and healthy for one
theres no need for threats lwaxana is a sensible female
i dont like the sound of this mother
i believe i can control him little one
im sure we can talk about this just the two of us
a wise choice farek leave us and you may rejoin your friend
mother are you sure
ill be fine

and now lwaxana troi let us talk


fifteen hours from gamma erandi and already the subspace static is playing hell with communications
just what youd expect from a stellar nursery
wesley congratulations on passing your starfleet written examination an excellent achievement
thanks data now if i can just do well on the oral exams
not to worry you will and when you return well be gaining the best ensign in the fleet
there is no guarantee that wesley will be reassigned to the enterprise ninety one per cent of starfleet graduates are not posted to galaxy class starships on their first assignment
i never thought of that i always assumed id be coming back to the enterprise
im sure captain picard will request you that is if hes still commanding the enterprise when you graduate
i never thought of that either i never thought id feel this way about leaving you guys and the enterprise
is that not a part of the human experience growth and change
i suppose so but
listen wesley i felt the same way when i left my family to go to the academy but it was one of the best times of my life youre going to meet new friends and have adventures that you cant even imagine yet
i hope youre right geordi


little one togs given me something perfectly hideous to wear he says it flatters my beauty
so far mothers in no danger i hope she knows what shes doing
well shes bought us some time lets make the most of it  i wouldnt do that
i dont need your help
the hell you dont youre two moves away from being mated see you should have listened to me now youve only got one possible escape that wasnt it

you shouldve moved the bishop
ridiculous the bishop was pinned
dont listen to me forget the fact that i beat you in thirty moves
pure luck
i was being polite i couldve won in twenty moves
then prove it  pawn to queen four kings level
pawn to kings bishop three queens level

i must admit when you first approached me aboard the enterprise i was intrigued
you mean revolted
perhaps a little do you forgive me
yes with your powers we could be a formidable team

my you have great strength in your hands
and you like that
i have always admired strong males
you are beautiful it is impossible for me to resist you
then dont


initial scans of ionisation patterns complete sir now correlating sensor readings
its almost incomprehensible the amount of energy being expended
actually it is five point three four times ten to the forty first watts sir well within the norm for this type of phenomena
yes yes yes perhaps data but that takes away none of the wonder

check
im sick of this game
of course now that youre losing
whos losing im just tired of standing up
you cant resign now
its hard to play from in here i cant even see the whole board
ah then youll finish the game if i let you out of the cell
i might
clever human but im not that foolish
what do you think im going to try to escape what would that get me youve already got her besides where would i go
i do not trust you
fine thanks for the game
come out here  now save your rook if you can

and that was my first husband not much of a conversationalist but what a lover well then i met zarn
i do not want to hear about your other romances it makes me jealous
my my what big ears you have has anyone ever told you how attractive they are

some females think they are my best feature no one has ever given me oomox like this before
oomox
there is no translation but the ear is one of our most erogenous zones


those ferengi have iron jaws

little one if tog were a kitten hed be purring

 good work mother  according to mother daimon tog is extremely relaxed at the moment
tell lwaxana to keep him relaxed while we call the cavalry
access to communications denied all transmissions to be authorised by daimon tog
lets see just how relaxed daimon tog is

mother were out of the cell and were trying to contact the enterprise but we cant do it without togs access code do you think you could manage to
say no more little one
lwaxana you and i are going to make such a wonderful team with your telepathy and my cunning i foresee
a very profitable future

subspace interference is subsiding sir communications have been restored
good contact commander riker on betazed
message coming in from betazed sir priority one
on screen
captain picard at last we have been trying to reach you for two days
our communications have been blocked by the nebula reittan is there a problem
im afraid so captain lwaxana deanna and commander riker have disappeared

i knew i wanted you the moment i saw you you have fulfilled all my expectations
how sweet
farek thought it was a bad idea but i knew better
how clever
i knew best i always know best
how repugnant
what
i said how romantic i cant resist a man who knows what he wants and goes after it
thats me thats why im daimon of this ship i take charge of every situation more to the left woman
whatever you say my darling would you care for something to drink
youre so attentive
does your food synthesiser know how to make an arcturian fizz
i dont think so
they have certain pleasureenhancing qualities
mmm
let me teach your computer how to make one ill need your access code
yes my beloved computer access code kayee yooree dahtayee
tog be silent i knew you were not to be trusted
doctor farek i was going to make daimon tog a drink
save your lies for this fool
oh please dont listen to him dont no hes misunderstood me
no tog you have misunderstood you have been tricked by a sly female who finds you repulsive
she was only trying to serve me a drink
you almost gave her complete access to the ships computer a security breach severe enough to cost you your command its time you took my advice let me study her
study her your mind probes could kill her
you brought her aboard for her telepathic powers if i can determine what neural configuration gives her those powers i may be able to duplicate them we could still profit from this
i dont know
a true daimon would not be blinded by lust give her to me or i may be forced to report your transgressions
very well take her


when you have finished here survey in that direction
aye sir
i wish i had some answers for you lieutenant worf
mister homn was no help
none he last saw them as he was leaving this clearing when he returned all three of them were gone
lieutenant foley discovered this in the pond  the species is zan periculi it is not indigenous to betazed but to lappa four a ferengi world

now we now have a reasonable hypothesis as to whom
the difficult question is where
the ferengi ship is almost as fast as the enterprise she could be anywhere by now
commander riker will assume that well be searching for them hell find some way to send us a message mister worf i want continual monitoring of ferengi subspace frequencies mister la forge can you extend our sensor range
if i narrow the band and tie in long range sensors to the subspace scanners i can boost the gain
make it so
do you wish to leave orbit sir
not until we have someplace to go

ive done everything i know how its no use without togs security code i cant get near their communication system
were running out of time fareks about to begin the neural scan on mother
maybe im going about this in the wrong way if i pick a minor subsystem something nonessential like this warp field phase adjustment all this does is suppress the subspace interference generated by the warp engines
meaning what
meaning if i set up a simple oscillation i can send out a signal the trick is to create a message that the enterprise will understand but that the ferengi will think is just normal subspace static whats wrong

mother will we have to help her

thanks for your help wes but youd better get aboard the bradbury they were ready to break orbit an hour ago
soon as im sure this works
initiating scans now captain
can you locate the krayton
ferengi transmissions are routinely scrambled and encoded sir without breaking the code we will be unable to identify any specific ferengi vessel
ferengi codes are damn near impossible to break
gentlemen i have the utmost confidence in your ability to perform the impossible
captain the bradbury is hailing us they can no longer delay their departure
mister crusher now no lengthy farewells good luck
thank you sir

the repetitive nature of the subcarrier pattern would imply a modified

deck six

wesley

take care
you too mom
something the matter
weve been scanning ferengi transmissions trying to find the krayton one of the signals was i dont know familiar somehow
something in the message
no the message was scrambled it was the static
where are you going

captain the bradbury has informed us they can wait no longer for mister crusher to come aboard

wesley
captain i think theres a pattern to the subspace interference i heard on one of the ferengi messages
wesley unless you leave immediately youre going to miss the bradbury
the interference itself could be a message if i could just hear a replay of the subspace scans
signal the bradbury they may leave play back the ferengi transmissions
wait repeat that one put it on a continuous replay hear that popping noise data can you filter out everything but that sound
thats cochrane distortion a fluctuation in the phase of the subspace field all warp engines generate that kind of interference
but listen to the pattern its the algolian ceremonial rhythm that the musician played at the reception
mister crusher is correct sir there is a temporal correlation
then it is a signal from commander riker ingenious he selected a signal wed recognise but one the ferengi would dismiss as static
signal source located captain
plot an intercept course
course plotted and laid in sir
well done mister crusher warp eight
aye sir
engage


get away from her
what are you doing br 
stand off commander

daimon tog cant we strike a bargain all im concerned about is my daughters safety what happens to me isnt important
what are you suggesting
let me be candid daimon tog deannas of no use to you shes only half betazoid and if you keep riker starfleet will never stop chasing for you release them release them and i will stay with you willingly ill even use my telepathy to aid you in your negotiations
a tempting offer i would like to believe you
the offer is genuine i give you my word as a daughter of the fifth house of betazed
lwaxana dont
ive made up my mind
i cant let you do this
william i am a grown woman i can make my own decisions
mother we cant just leave you here
yes you can and before he changes his mind
please little one do this for me just this once do we have an agreement
i give you my word i will release your daughter and the commander
daimon a federation ship approaching at high warp
the enterprise has found us
slow to impulse raise shields inform the enterprise that two of our guests are ready to return the other will be staying with us at her own request
i must protest daimon
lwaxana has given her word
oomox is only the beginning


are you both all right
none the worse for wear
my mother bought our freedom captain she doesnt want to stay with tog
hail the krayton
frequencies open daimon tog responding
on screen
captain picard so good of you to meet us we were on our way to betazed to return our guests
of course you were daimon but youre still holding lwaxana troi
when will you get it through your thick head that its over between us jeanluc

i think i know what shes doing you have to fight to get her back captain
open
er er its not over between us lwaxana youre mine and i will not let you go i insist you return to my side immediately
you mean you still care 
my love is a fever longing still for that which longer nurseth the disease
tell me more
in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes for they in thee a thousand errors see but tis my heart that loves what they despise who in despite of view are pleased to dote shall i compare the to a summers day thou art more lovely and more temperate


you didnt tell me that you and captain picard were
you said you didnt want to hear about my other romances i have a new love jeanluc

and you cant keep killing all my lovers that simply has to stop
killing
oh hes insanely jealous
listen tog i must possesses lwaxana and if that means destroying your ship in the process so be it
captain i had no idea lwaxana was
dont let him threaten you you can defeat him the only way youll ever get me back is over togs dead body
that can be arranged mister worf arm phaser banks and photon torpedoes if lwaxana troi is not in my arms in ten seconds throw everything youve got at the krayton
but you will destroy lwaxana
when i have plucked the rose i cannot give it vital growth again it needs must wither nine eight tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all

tennyson in memoriam 
 seven six
no wait
five four
beam her to their bridge now
two one

you wonderfully jealous fool you
captain i trust there will be no further action taken against us
such as my reporting this incident to your superiors who may question your competency as daimon i will think about it screen off
thank you jeanluc you were most convincing you certainly convinced me
i am truly grateful mrs troi that you risked your life to save my people ill have you home within a few hours
oh no no no no that wont be necessary id just love to hear more of your poetry
perhaps another time finally manages to stand up please mister crusher set course for betazed warp nine

you asked to see me captain
ive been in touch with admiral hahn at starfleet academy the admiral regrets your missing the oral examination but hopes that youll reapply next year
i understand sir and i do intend to reapply
in the interim the academys loss is our gain the enterprise will continue to benefit from your talents for another year
thank you sir is that all
no
is there something wrong captain
im just thinking that im saying goodbye to you as you are today
but i thought you said i wasnt going to be able to go
the academy must make you wait thats true but when i review your service to this ship your crewmates i cannot in all conscience make you wait for the academy you see wesley in my eyes youre an acting ensign in title only i hereby grant you field promotion to full ensign with all the commensurate responsibilities and privileges of that rank congratulations youre dismissed

lwaxana troi has beamed down to betazed captain
notify starfleet we are en route to the xanthras system for our rendezvous with the zapata
aye sir

ensign crusher take us out of orbit and set course for xanthras three warp factor six
aye sir course is set
engage

transfigurations

captains log stardate  we are charting an unexplored star system within the zeta gelis cluster this routine assignment has made for a refreshingly quiet time aboard the enterprise

thats her
which one
the one on the right dont stare
why not
because shell see
good you must let her see the fire in your eyes
but what would i say
words come later it is the scent that first speaks of love
thanks worf that helps a lot

hi geordi
hi
so how have you been
good i er
how are things down in engineering
fine they theyve been fine
well ill see you around

i have much to teach you about women
mister la forge report to transporter room three

whats this all about commander
sensors have discovered a small oneman spaceship crashed on the planet
were picked up lifesigns humanoid very faint and fading


radiation levels within acceptable limits

we can beam him out from under there get him right up to sickbay
hes not stable enough for transport theres damage to his brain stem autonomic functions are failing his heart needs active neurofeedback it cant regulate itself i need a volunteer
right here
im going to hook your nervous systems to the tricorder your brain will regulate both systems that should stabilise him long enough to get him up to the ship
take deep regular breaths if anything goes wrong ill break the connection
okay

geordi
im fine no problem
transporter room three to beam directly to sickbay

autonomic responses are still low begin cardiostimulation sixty ccs of inaprovaline massive infection is setting in use the protodynoplaser to stabilize his immune system we need to design a virus that can infiltrate his cell structure and boost his atp production
 what about commander la forge hes waiting in the diagnostic centre
i need you to give him a full bioscan see if theres any residual effect from that energy discharge during the neurolink keep his arm in cryogenic stasis until the vital signs are strong enough to begin surgical procedures


from the size and shape of the wreckage it appeared to be some kind of escape pod their control system was badly damaged which is probably what caused the crash
an escape pod then he couldnt have travelled very far mister data are there any other signs of ships in this area
i am picking up a scattering of debris in extended orbit around the planet it reads as refined metals and other synthetic compounds
the remains of a larger vessel he must have left in the pod before the ship was destroyed
sensors show trace elements in the debris that would indicate phaser fire was recently exchanged
were you able to salvage anything else from the escape pod
this is all that was left from their computer system
mister data can you access it
it will take time sir downloading this into our system will require fabrication of a matrix translator to emulate the aliens computer system
keep me apprised of your progress
aye sir

limb refusion appears to be successful doctor tissue oxygenation is within norms
thats all we can do for now we wont be able to test neuromuscular function for a few days

ah geordi
can i go now doc
no need to keep you here your bioscan came out negative
couldve told you that i feel great

hows your patient
i never thought hed make it this far there was major trauma to his head and chest cavity massive plasma loss and severe damage to most of his organs
what are his chances
i believe hes going to live im afraid i cant take the credit for it though his body seems to have amazing recuperative powers the damaged tissue seems to be repairing itself at a phenomenal rate theres one thing that troubles me though
whats that
take a look at this

cell regeneration
yes the thing is it has nothing to do with the injuries these are undamaged cells that seem to be mutating
do you have a theory as to the cause
no ive never seen anything like it in my life there is a possibility that its part of his natural healing process i hope it is because theres nothing i can do to stop it

im telling you data theres got to be some way to decode the information in this thing
i agree geordi but the data matrix within the capsule does not correspond to any standard format all we have been able to determine is that the device contains a chemically based system for molecular energy encoding
yeah and the computer still cant analyse the specific chemical elements involved its got to be part of the data processing system what if its a feedback loop controller
the compact shape does suggest a rapid chemical processing and storage capacity
we found it near the escape pods instrumentation assemblage this capsule might process the ships dynamic motions and augment its manual control inputs we could send it a few test signals make it think the entire assemblage was awake and operating
an intriguing experiment the capsule might provide us with information without the need to decode the storage medium itself perhaps we should examine your theory immediately
less talk more synthahol we came here to relax
i am relaxed in fact ive never felt better but you know worf youre right the storage capsule can wait awhile

christi youre not leaving are you
i was just on my way down to the arboretum
would you care for some company
id love some but i didnt think you were interested in that kind of thing
there are a lot of things you dont know about me

ive been tutoring him he learns very quickly
medical log stardate  i have removed patient john doe from the emergency biosupport unit in just thirty six hours most of his major organ systems have regenerated themselves to the point where they can now function on their own

i am alive
you certainly are
thank you for my life tell me who am i
captains log stardate  our mission to map the zeta gelis star cluster is proceeding on schedule meanwhile doctor crusher reports that the recovery of the patient she has named john doe continues at a remarkable pace


are you experiencing any discomfort
none i can feel the life returning to my body
your neurofibre waves are functioning almost normally again that puts you about six weeks ahead of my original schedule
that should give you and your colleagues something to talk about
you are all weve talked about since your arrival
i believe im ready for the next phase of my treatment
you are right it is time you stopped taking up valuable bed space now these motorassist bands will provide you with electrical stimulation for your arms and legs they will help you relearn how to control your muscles again but remember youve been off your feet for almost a month so dont be disappointed if at first your mobility is restricted your limbs are still weak
i appreciate your concern doctor but i think i may surprise you again i feel strong enough to fly

whoops
perhaps i should concentrate on walking first
lets try again a little more slowly this time
much more slowly

i envy your reflexes captain
i envy your strength of will doctor crusher has been keeping me informed of your progress its quite extraordinary
i have an extraordinary doctor she gave me back my life i hope that i am worthy of her efforts
are you still unable to recall anything about your past
unfortunately captain my memories begin the moment i woke up in sickbay doctor crusher told me you think i was in some kind of battle picard im quite sure of that have you any idea how you came to be in that escape pod or what happened to the ship
no believe me captain its a horrible feeling not knowing who you are or where youre from
have you tried synaptic induction
his neural nets dont conform to any known patterns conventional neurotherapy has proven ineffective hopefully in time his memory pathways will reestablish themselves naturally

that same pain
yes i think ive made enough progress for one day
not a relapse i hope
this is nothing to do with his previous wounds i think this has something to do with the continuing mutation of his cell structure
you still have no theory as to whats causing it
it doesnt make any sense
i seem to be a mystery doctor to you and to myself


well this is where i get off see you tonight in ten forward
yeah ill be there
hello commander
miss henshaw

bridge
deck six
so you and miss henshaw have been seeing a lot of each other
every night this week
is that all i thought youd been walking around with that smile on your face a lot longer than that
i guess i have this whole last month or so everything seems to be going my way i dont know what it is but something sure has changed around here
the only thing thats changed is you
me im the same old guy i always was
if you say so i dont remember the old geordi having that much success with miss christi henshaw
well maybe i am a little bit more confident than i used to be


what happened to you
i was kayaking in the holodeck again
you dislocated your shoulder sit down ill get the osteotractor frame
hi mom we still on for dinner tonight
seven thirty sharp ill be right back
kayaking again
yeah
hows my moms favourite patient
judge for yourself

not bad
your mom promised me a tour of the ship tomorrow you may find this hard to believe but sickbay can be an incredibly boring place to be
hey doc im dying here
dont worry my friend youll be alright

the pains gone
its completely healed i dont understand what did you do
i dont know it was instinct i just touched him


ive run every test and scan on him that i can think of and yet theres no physiological evidence to indicate that he would possess such powers but then theres so much about john thats a mystery
you know i really like him
he does have a certain charm doesnt he the entire medical staff has commented on it
you seem a little taken with him yourself
he has a strength and serenity that i find very attractive and yet hes vulnerable i guess i find him intriguing
seems like theres a little more to it than that
is this your way of asking me if im getting romantically involved with him
you said it i didnt
my feelings toward him arent romantic exactly i mean i know that the doctorpatient relationship can sometimes create a false sense of intimacy but this is different theres an almost spiritual connection i guess im not making any sense am i
i think i understand

data i was thinking about the storage capsule last night and i was wondering what if weve been going about this thing the wrong way weve been trying to analyse its mechanical properties what if it is a biochemical storage medium
are you suggesting that it employs memory rna like an organic cell
well it does contain quantities of nucleic acids
perhaps the information sequences are encoded in the molecular patterns themselves
computer scan the storage capsule analyse molecular sequences on nucleic acid chains

well what do you know a navigational chart
it appears that your hypothesis was correct geordi
i knew it captain
found something
we have determined that the storage cube from john does escape pod contains navigational information
can you match these stars to our charts
computer run transformational matrix calculations match navigational referents to known stars in this sector
information on this sector is incomplete no correlation
im not giving up yet not after coming so close to cracking this thing you know that might be flight path information from johns ship but without a frame of reference i cant determine its origin points
computer assume those paths are course corrections and derive gravitational values for stellar objects near those flight paths
most of these are ordinary gtype stars this would appear to be a neutron star possibly a pulsar
which means that this might be a rotational time reference
computer assume these symbols are pulsars translate associated values into standard temporal notations computer is there a pulsar with a rotational period of one point five two four four seconds within sensor range
affirmative
bingo now computer overlay navigational chart using referenced pulsars and project a flight path back to its origin
flight path originated at bearing zero zero three mark zero one five distance two point three parsecs
thats it captain thats where john doe came from
that bearing is almost directly along our planned course sir
good then we can continue our mission without significant interruption

home
yes using the information we found in your escape pod we may be able to return you to your people
i cannot go back
why is that
you must not take me home captain
john your memory has it returned
all i know is that we came out here to escape
escape
there were others with you
yes i was not alone but what happened to the others or what we were escaping from i cannot remember but i do know you must not take me back not yet
we will not arrive in your star system for at least three weeks that will give us plenty of time to discuss this further
hopefully by then you will have regained more of your memory
youre right of course captain i apologise for my outburst
its understandable


this ship is astounding it seems to stretch on without end
we can see the rest of it some other time this is your first day out of sickbay and i dont want you to overexert yourself
this looks like an ideal place to rest
my thoughts exactly
truly remarkable
what is
these people theyre all so different from one another yet they work together freely
that surprises you
it is new to me my people are different somehow if only i could remember yesterday for one terrifying moment there was clarity
you mean the energy pulse
yes for that moment my purpose seemed clear and then it was gone
the pain the energy pulse must be linked to the cell mutation in the body i wish i could help you find the truth
beverly youve done so much for me i only wish there was some way i could repay you
but you have the friendship weve developed has made me very happy
the rapport that exists between us also means a great deal to me but i am on some kind of journey whatever brought me here whatever is happening to my body is all part of that journey and i must complete it before any other consideration

sir i am reading a vessel on long range scanners it is coming from sector nine five six nine
what configuration
impossible to identify at this distance however it is on an intercept course
captain the ship is travelling at warp nine point seven two
warp nine point seven two
time to intercept
at present course and speed ten hours fifty three minutes
try and hail them mister worf
no response captain
keep monitoring their approach repeat the hail every half an hour
aye sir
whoever they are theyre in a big hurry to get here


doctor crusher medical emergency room four
i cant make it stop
john tell me is it worse than before
much worse
should i get something for the pain
no the readings are fluctuating too wildly besides it wouldnt do any good his entire cell structure is transforming
i have to leave beverly
john where do you have to go
i must get off this ship
thats impossible not in your condition
i must


security


okay lets realign the magnetic inducer on the starboard nacelle

john
leave the control booth immediately

john listen to me you must come down ill try to help you
step away from the controls
get back please stay away
i have no wish to harm you but you must return to sickbay immediately
no do not come any closer i cannot control over what is happening to me

his neck is broken no life signs sickbay form a resuscitation team i have a code seven in shuttlebay two transporter room stand by
hold it
no dont

hold still
doc
i cant believe it theres no trace of injury


you admit you were trying to steal a shuttlecraft
yes
so i ask you again why
i dont know
unacceptable you had a reason i want to know what it was damn it you nearly killed a member of my crew
and healed him
im not forgetting that thats the reason hes here and not in the brig
i warned him i told him it was dangerous
why why was it dangerous what is happening to you
i dont know
the rate of metamorphosis is accelerating its almost as if your body were generating an electrical field thats warping the tissue
who are you what are you
im afraid for myself for all of you i have to get away isolate myself whatever is happening to me its dangerous
as lieutenant worf discovered
i dont want to hurt anyone captain for the sake of your crew let me go before this happens again
john i dont believe youre capable of harming any
captain the alien vessel is coming within weapons range its shields are up
im on my way i want him kept under constant surveillance

john i really want to thank you
for what
i dont know how or even why but down on the planet you gave me something a new confidence
i doubt i can take credit for that perhaps i only helped you find something you already had
captain on screen alien vessel approaching at half impulse sir heading zero five one mark one one four
raise shields slow to one third impulse power bring us to one zero three mark zero two five mister worf hail the alien vessel
they continue to ignore our hails sir
they are scanning us captain
they are answering our hail captain
on screen
sunad

you know him
yes i dont know how but hes dangerous

i am commander sunad of zalkon you are trespassing into our space and you are holding a zalkonian citizen
im captain jeanluc picard of the united federation of planets we do not intend transgression of
you will return him to us immediately
sunad this individual is a guest aboard our ship we found him dying in a shipwreck we returned him to health
then you aided a criminal he is one of four escaped prisoners we eliminated the other three we thought this one dead as well return him so we may complete our task
of what is he accused
he is a disruptive influence he spreads lies he encourages dissent he disturbs the natural order of our society
in what way
it is not your concern i will give you two hours to comply

tactical analysis
the zalkonian ship has a formidable armament their weaponry is comparable to ours
theyre as fast and probably just as manoeuvrable
counsellor do they mean to carry out their threat
i believe so sunads hatred for john was evident but theres something else the zalkonians are afraid of john
commander riker counsellor doctor john i want you to join us mister data you have the bridge mister worf stay at tactical counter any moves the zalkonian makes
aye sir

i can neither confirm nor deny what the zalkonians told you
they make serious accusations against you
their accusations may be true i dont know i dont believe that i am a criminal
you understand the difficult position in which im placed
completely and i refuse to place your ship in danger if necessary i will surrender to them but i am convinced theres more at stake here than my life theres something important i must complete my survival is vital if i could explain it i would
ill inform you of my decision shortly

captain you cant seriously be considering
we must consider all options doctor and not let our personal feelings impede our judgment
youre going to tell me its irrelevant that wed be sending him to his death
whether we approve of the zalkonians intentions is not the issue but for what its worth i believe john is correct that his existence has broader ramifications than that of a simple criminal
sunad thinks so he feels personally threatened by john
sunad called john a disruptive influence thats hardly a capital offence
its not up to us to judge their laws doctor
i know how i would feel if the situation were reversed if they were in our territory holding a federation citizen
the zalkonians truly dont understand our indecision about returning john in their eyes we shouldnt even be involved
but we are involved i saved his life for what so that they could chase him down and take away that life away

picard we will not tolerate more delays
commander let me remind you we are on a mission of exploration our purpose is to establish peaceful relations with the civilisations we encounter
we do not want relations with you
if that is your wish we will respect it
we simply want you to leave zalkonian space as soon as you return the criminal
commander we will leave it is not our policy to intervene in the affairs of other cultures but before i return the survivor to you i would appreciate a more detailed explanation of what he has done to merit a death sentence
as i said it is not your concern
agreed however there are circumstances of which you may be unaware the survivor has suffered a memory loss hes therefore illequipped to defend himself against your accusations
there is no defence our judgment is final
theres something else since his recovery hes manifested unusual abilities
what kind of abilities
he apparently has the power to heal injuries with a simple touch
lies
and even to reverse death itself
obviously he has corrupted you as well i see i am wasting my time


i cant breathe

its come back to me beverly i know who i am what i am



ready all weapons
you will no longer harm these people sunad
fire upon that ship

do not be afraid i wont hurt you
kill him captain hes evil
you could learn from these people sunad they do not fear me
they dont know how dangerous you are you and the others like you
that is what you and the other leaders have maintained for generations but it is not true captain my species is on the verge of a wondrous evolutionary change a transmutation beyond our physical being i am the first of my kind to approach this metamorphosis they tried to convince us it was a sickness we would never survive that the pain and energy pulses would kill us they claimed we were dangerous so they destroyed anyone who exhibited the signs of the transfiguration
we were protecting our society
by murdering us you saw the mutations as a threat to your authority you were terrified of something you couldnt understand some suspected that what was happening to them was not evil four of us decided to flee zalkon and let the metamorphosis take its course you hunted us down killed the others but i survived with the help of a kind and generous people

there is nothing to fear you can join me all zalkonians can let me show you
dont touch me
as you wish but others will listen now that you can no longer prevent me from telling them the truth those who are willing will follow me
sunad is back aboard the zalkonian vessel captain

my people are about to embark upon a new realm a new plane of existence thanks to you
it is our mission to seek out life in all forms we are privileged to have been present at the emergence of a new species
beverly you gave me life and more i do not have the words for my gratitude nor my sorrow at leaving you

the best of both worlds part one

captains log stardate  the enterprise has arrived at jouret four in response to a distress signal from one of the federations outermost colonies

anything from the surface
no sir there have been no communications from the colony for over twelve hours
sensors picking up any signs of life
none
the surface environment is safe for transport commander

mister obrien

verify these are accurate coordinates for new providence colony
coordinates verified sir

youre at the centre of town

captains log stardate  admiral hanson and lieutenant commander shelby of starfleet tactical have arrived to review the disappearance of new providence colony no sign remains of the nine hundred inhabitants

the truth is hell we are not ready weve known they were coming for over a year weve thrown every resource we have into this but still
then youre convinced it is the borg
 thats what im here to find out the initial descriptions of these surface conditions are almost identical to your reports from system j two five
commander riker wrote those reports he agrees with you
commander shelby took over borg tactical analysis six months ago ive learned to give her a wide latitude when i want to get things done thats how i intend to operate here
my priority has been to develop some kind any kind of defence strategy
obviously nothing we have now can stop them
weve been designing new weapons but theyre all still on the drawing board
we expected much more lead time your encounter with the borg was over seven thousand light years away
if this is the borg it would indicate they have a source of power far superior to our own
id like to see the colony site as soon as possible captain
itll be dark there in thirty minutes weve scheduled an away team for dawn
number one why dont you show the commander to her quarters
its our poker night admiral theres always an open seat for you
another time commander your captain and i have a lot to cover but rumour has it commander shelbys played a hand or two

keep your eye on her jean luc shes one very impressive young lady
you seem rather taken with her jp
just an old mans fantasies when shelby came into tactical every admirals uncle had a take on this borg business she cut through it she put us on track
earl grey
please shed make you a hell of a first officer
i already have a hell of a first officer
dont tell me hes going to pass up another commission
ones available
the melbourne its his if he wants it hasnt he told you
hell make a fine captain jp
you may want to tell him that were still waiting on his decision this is the third time weve pulled out the captains chair for riker he just wont sit down let me tell you something jeanluc there are a lot of young hotshots like shelby on their way up riker could suddenly look like hes standing still next to them hes hurting his career by staying put if i were you id kick him in the rear end for his own good

i dont know exactly what im looking for but weve tested the sections of the enterprises hull that were damaged by the borg there were some unusual magnetic resonance traces
a borg footprint
thats my theory ill see if it holds up tomorrow ive reviewed your personnel ill be assigning mister la forge and mister data to accompany me on the away team
ive already assigned them to the away team and ill be with you as well commander
of course i appreciate any assistance you can offer tell me commander is serving aboard the enterprise as extraordinary an experience as ive heard
every bit
good because i intend to convince captain picard im the right choice for the job
job which job
yours of course im sorry i heard that you were leaving
if i were im sure youll be the first to know pokers at seventeen hundred hours in my quarters deck eight


got another king in the hole data
i am afraid i cannot answer that wesley and as you are a newcomer to the game may i say it is inappropriate for you to ask i will buy another card counsellor
no help there
fold again
three jacks looking back for the handsome young ensign  pair of deuces stands  flush possible straight flush your bet mister crusher
im in for ten
call
now its time for the long pants theres your ten and one hundred
hes got the straight flush folks
not necessarily commander riker may be bluffing wesley
i dont think so fold
with three jacks what are you kidding wesley you may get straight as in school but theres a lot you need to learn about poker
well ive only got two pair but ive got to see your hole card ill call

you got him

mister data and our guest appear to be tardy
sir commander shelby and data beamed down to the planet surface an hour ago
on whose authority
on hers sir

morning early bird gets the worm eh weve had some interesting results
commander shelby walk with me commander
early bird i believe commander shelby erred there is no evidence of avifaunal or crawling vermicular lifeforms on jouret four
thats not what she meant data but youre right she erred
im sorry but i woke up early and i saw that a weather system was moving in it it could have affected the soil readings
so without any regard to the risk of coming down alone
really commander if we ran into the borg here two extra bodies wouldntve made a hell of a difference now would they we had three hours before the storm front hit less than two hours now data was available i took him we came i dont see your problem
my problem commander is i expect to be notified before theres a change in my orders
noted for future reference do you wish to hear my report sir
go ahead
the soil contains the same magnetic resonance traces thats our footprint theres no doubt any more it is the borg
captains log stardate  with confirmation of the borgs presence in federation space admiral hanson has returned to starbase three two four to discuss strategy with starfleet command lieutenant commander shelby remains on board to continue tactical preparations

ive also ordered a standing yellow alert all federation and allied outposts have been warned ops will continue to monitor long range sensors ive assigned data la forge and mister crusher to work with commander shelby
good youve covered all the bases whats your impression of shelby
she knows her stuff
she has your full confidence
well i think she needs supervision she takes the initiative a little too easily sometimes with risks
sounds a little like a young lieutenant commander i once recruited as a first officer
perhaps
will what the hell are you still doing here
sir
youve been offered the melbourne
ive decided not to pursue that commission at this time
shes a fine ship will
yes but shes not the enterprise with all due respect sir you need me particularly now
indeed starfleet needs good captains particularly now reconsider your decision
are you telling me to leave captain
im asking you to look at your career objectively will youre ready to work without a net youre ready to take command and you know the enterprise will go along just fine without you

what am i still doing here deanna i pushed myself hard to get this far i sacrificed a lot i always said i wanted my own command and yet somethings holding me back is it wrong for me to want to stay
what do you think
maybe im just afraid of the big chair
i dont think so
the captain says shelby reminds him of the way i used to be and hes right she comes in here full of drive and ambition impatient taking risks i look at her and i wonder whatever happened to those things in me i liked those things about me ive lost something
you mean youre older more experienced a little more seasoned
seasoned thats a horrible thing to say to a man
i dont think youve lost a thing and i think youve gained more than you realise youre much more comfortable with yourself than you used to be
maybe thats the problem im too comfortable here
im not sure i know what that means youre happy here happier than ive ever known you to be so it comes down to a simple question what do you want will riker

a manipulation effect in the borg ships subspace field a definite pattern at four point eight minute intervals during your first confrontation with them
might indicate high output auxiliary generators kicking in
one theory is that their systems are decentralised with redundant power sources located throughout the ship
that is a reasonable conclusion borg technology has given each member of their society the ability to interface and function collectively it is likely they have constructed their ship with the same philosophy
you knock out one generator and another takes over without interruption
what kind of damage would we have to do to shut them down
projections suggest that a borg ship like this one could continue to function effectively even if seventy eight percent of it was inoperable
and our best shot barely scratched the surface
well from what ive seen i cant believe any of these new weapons systems can be ready in less than eighteen months commander
weve been projecting twenty four
is there anything we can do here to adapt to our current defence systems
well have to go through the specs again but i dont know my minds turned to clay
mine too
i think we should look at modifying the plasma phaser design
commander i think we should call it a night thats an order well reconvene at oh five hundred
sir if youll allow me to continue with mister data who does not require rest
you need rest commander
if we have a confrontation with the borg without improving our defence systems
if we have a confrontation i dont want a crew fighting the borg at the same time theyre fighting their own fatigue dismissed

at nineteen hundred hours yesterday the uss lalo departed zeta alpha two on a freight run to sentinel minor four at twenty two hundred hours and twelve minutes a distress signal was received at starbase one five seven the lalo reported contact with an alien vessel described as cube shaped the distress signal ended abruptly and shes not been heard from since
mister data how long would it take to get there at warp nine
one hour seventeen minutes sir
make it so
were coming with every available starship to assist captain but the closest help is six days away
well try and keep them occupied until you arrive
i know you will hanson out
all hands will stand to battle stations
commander shelby what is the status of out defence preparations
mister la forge has a plan to modulate shield nutation hopefully thatll hold them off for awhile
at the same time well be retuning phasers to higher em base emitting frequencies to try to disrupt their subspace field
whats your assessment of our potential effectiveness
its a shot in the dark captain but for now its the best we can do
dismissed

sir reading unidentified vessel just entering sensor range bearing two one zero mark one five one
hail them mister worf
no response sir
move to intercept
aye sir
sir the vessel has already changed course to intercept us approaching at warp nine point three entering visual range
on screen magnify

mister worf dispatch a subspace message to admiral hanson we have engaged the borg
captain you are being hailed
i am
yes captain by name
data is it the same ship we faced at j two five
uncertain commander but the dimensions are precisely the same
on screen i am jean luc

jean luc picard captain of the starship enterprise registry ncc d you will lower shields and prepare to transport yourself aboard our vessel if you do not cooperate we will destroy your ship
you have committed acts of aggression against the united federation of planets if you do not withdraw immediately
you will surrender yourself or we will destroy your ship your defensive capabilities are unable to withstand us

what the hell do they want with you
i thought they werent interested in human life forms only our technology
their priorities seem to have changed open
channel open
we have developed new defence capabilities since our last meeting and we are prepared to use them if you do not withdraw from federation space
captain

the shields are being probed im modulating nutation

captain the borg are attempting to lock on to us with their tractor beam
load torpedo bays arm phasers lock coordinates on the source of the tractor beam
shield status
holding sir
the nutation modulation has them confused
they have the ability to analyse and adapt commander


shield modulation has failed theyve locked on

shields are being drained ninety percent eighty

trying to recalibrate nutation damn

shields have failed
fire all weapons

their subspace field is intact new phaser frequencies had no impact

reverse engines
full reverse

were not moving

fire at will
launching torpedoes phaser spread continuing
still no damage to the borg vessel sir

they are in pursuit captain
maintain course
damage report geordi
hull rupture in main engineering the damage is pretty heavy we lost a lot of good people down there
eleven dead eight more unaccounted for captain
repair teams to engineering seal hull breach
they didnt get to the core i can control functions from here
now approaching the paulson nebula sir
drop to impulse take us in ensign

the field is getting too dense sir
steady analysis of the nebula cloud mister data
eighty two percent dilithium hydroxyls magnesium chromium it should provide an effective screen against their sensors captain
mister la forge prepare to reverse engines full stop

the borg ship is continuing scans attempting to locate us
good as long as theyre looking for us they wont hurt anyone else


time index five one four data started to fluctuate phaser resonance frequencies the borgs beam breaks contact slow playback take a closer look commander mister la forge
theres a two percent drop in power for an instant but it is system wide the phaser frequency spread was in a high narrow band
conceivably the ships power distribution nodes are vulnerable to those frequencies
if we can generate a concentrated burst of power at that same frequency distribution i mean a lot more than anything our phasers or photon torpedoes could ever provide
how do we do that
the main deflector dish
its the only component of the enterprise designed to channel that much power at controlled frequencies
end programme unfortunately there is one slight detail in the process the blast completely destroys the enterprise as well
but if we could get further away increase the deflectors range
it could work in the meantime we should retune all phasers including the hand units to the same frequency
proceed ill inform the captain
there is one other recommendation id like to make commander separate the saucer section assign a skeleton crew to create a diversion
we may need the power from the saucer impulse engines
but it would give them more than one target to worry about
its too great a risk
id like the captain to make that decision sir
commander i bring all the alternatives to the captains attention thatll be all

im going to need to install higher capacity power transfers to the deflector dish commander
how long
better part of a day
she gets a full head of steam doesnt she
shes a formidable presence to say the least but im convinced she can help us here commander
i am too dont worry about it i can handle shelby

come

come in number one commander shelby was just telling me of your concerns about her plan
im sorry if she troubled you sir i have already informed her
yes i entirely agree with you number one its not the time but the time may come when we will be required to take greater risks i want you to consider her plan as a fall back position make the necessary preparations
very good sir

deck eight battle bridge
halt commander you and i need to have a conversation
you never ordered me not to discuss this with the captain
you disagree with me fine you need to take it to the captain then fine through me you do an end run around me again ill snap you back so hard youll think youre a first year cadet again
may i speak frankly sir
by all means
youre in my way
really how terrible for you
all you know how to do is play it safe i suppose thats why someone like you sits in the shadow of a great man for as long as you have passing up one command after another proceed to deck eight
when it comes to this ship and this crew youre damned right i play it safe
if you cant make the big decisions commander i suggest you make room for someone who can
captains log stardate  the enterprise remains concealed in the dust cloud and to my surprise the borg have maintained their position waiting for us to come out of hiding i have no explanation for their special interest in me or this ship we continue to prepare our defences for the inevitable confrontation but i must admit on this night i contemplate the distinct possibility that no defence may be adequate against this enemy


trouble sleeping
something of a tradition guinan the captain touring the ship before a battle
before a hopeless battle if i remember the tradition correctly
not necessarily nelson toured the hms victory before trafalgar
yes but nelson never returned from trafalgar did he
no but the battle was won
do you expect this battle to be won
we may yet prevail thats a conceit but its a healthy one i wonder if the emperor honorious watching the visigoths coming over the seventh hill truly realised that the roman empire was about to fall this is just another page in history isnt it will this be the end of our civilisation turn the page
this isnt the end
you say that with remarkable assuredness
with experience when the borg destroyed my world my people scattered throughout the universe we survived as will humanity survive as long as theres a handful of you to keep the spirit alive you will prevail even if it takes a millennium

captain picard report to the bridge
im on my way lieutenant

theyre some kind of magnetometric guided charges

status of shields
back to forty eight percent captain
mister la forge i may have to take us out of the nebula i want all the power you can give me
engines are ready captain

recommend we adjust shield harmonics to favour the upper em band when you proceed
acknowledged

direct hit deck nine
damage report
structural latching system integrity breached
prepare to take us out of here number one
fire up the engines half impulse until we clear the nebula then punch it to warp nine
ready phasers load forward torpedo bays engage

borg tractor beam is attempting to lock on
fire at will continue rotating shield frequency
shields failing tractor beam has locked on

its no use theyve already adapted to the new frequencies

the borg ship is disengaging leaving at warp speed
maintain pursuit
borg vessel has reached warp nine nine point four nine point six
stay with them riker to obrien can you get a fix on the captain
negative sir theres some kind of interference i cant lock in on his signal
senior officers report to the bridge
sir the coordinates they have set theyre on a direct course to sector zero zero one the terran system
earth


captain jean luc picard you lead the strongest ship of the federation fleet you speak for your people
i have nothing to say to you and i will resist you with my last ounce of strength
strength is irrelevant resistance is futile we wish to improve ourselves we will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own your culture will adapt to service ours
impossible my culture is based on freedom and self determination
freedom is irrelevant self determination is irrelevant you must comply
we would rather die
death is irrelevant your archaic cultures are authority driven to facilitate our introduction into your societies it has been decided that a human voice will speak for us in all communications you have been chosen to be that voice

commander they are leading us into the heart of our own defences
yeah well so far they havent had any reason to worry about our defences
commander if the borg stay at warp nine point six well be forced to discontinue pursuit and power down in less than three hours
two hours forty minutes and three seconds
how soon before the deflectors ready
were close few hours maybe i know ill get it done in two somehow but commander i going to need serious power from the warp engines to make this weapon work so far were using everything weve got just to keep up with them
sir weve got to get that ship down to impulse
im leading an away team over there to get the captain back well find a way to bring them out of warp ensign crusher you continue to assist mister la forge commander shelby youll take the bridge and coordinate with starfleet data worf doctor youre with me
excuse me sir with my knowledge of the borg
those are my orders commander
commander riker it is inappropriate for you to lead the away team until the return of captain picard you are in command of the enterprise were in a state of war and your place is on the bridge
commander shelby youll lead the away team make it so
first officers log stardate  our pursuit of the borg continues on a course that will take us to the very core of the federation the devastation they could bring is beyond imagination

these phasers have been retuned each has a different frequency spanning the upper em band
all right a reminder we only get to use each of these once maybe twice before the borg learn to adapt dont fire until you have to
what kind of resistance should we expect
at our first encounter the borg virtually ignored us when we beamed aboard their vessel clearly they did not consider our being there a threat to them
that may change however if we start interfering with their plans shelby to bridge

away team ready
weve got fifty eight minutes before we have to power down and disengage
understood
proceed commander

no unnecessary risks clear
very clear sir shelby out
weve matched warp velocity for transport commander
energise

tricorder functions minimal
any signs of human life
inconclusive

look at this this is extraordinary

these appear to be some kind of power wave guide conduits which allow them to work collectively as they perform ship functions
theres no way to take out enough of these to disable them down
what if we look at this from a mosquitos point of view
interesting metaphor doctor what is your idea
if we sting them in a tender spot they might stop for a minute to scratch

distribution nodes
if we take out a few of these it just might make them scratch
the captains communicator it is still activated
crusher to picard can you hear me
can you locate it worf
this way

i strongly recommend redeploying all available defences to protect sector zero zero one admiral
were moving to intercept at wolf three five nine well make our stand there how much longer can you maintain pursuit
twenty two minutes if they stay at current speed if we cant bring them out of warp well do as much damage as we can before we have to disengage
picard
nothing yet sir

in here

shelby to enterprise

go ahead
weve found the captains uniform and his communicator were resuming our search

stand by commander
were in business
itll burn out the main deflector but itll be one hell of a bang
radiation danger
were going to have to evacuate the entire forward half of the secondary hull and the lower three decks of the saucer
ill see to that
commander shelby

we have only seventeen minutes of warp power left do whatever you can to get them out of warp
acknowledged shelby out lets take out some of these distribution nodes and see what happens


sir theyve done it the borg ship is dropping out of warp
go to impulse
aye sir
diverting warp energy to main deflector
move us to within forty thousand kilometres match velocity commence arming sequence increase deflector modulation to upper frequency band


shelby to enterprise encountering resistance prepare to beam us back on my signal

theyre adapting to the frequencies

jeanluc

captain

enterprise get us out of here


the captain
we were unable to retrieve him sir sir the captain has been altered by the borg
altered
he is a borg
well go back i need more people we need to retune the phasers again well get him out of there
commander reading subspace field fluctuations from within the borg ship looks like theyre regenerating restoring power they could be capable of warp any minute
is the deflector ready
its ready
will hes alive if we could get him back to the ship i might be able to restore
this is our only chance to destroy them if they get back into warp our weapon is useless
well sabotage them again if we have to
we cant maintain power we dont have the time prepare to fire
at least consult with starfleet command get admiral hanson on subspace
belay that order lieutenant theres no time
sir we are being hailed by the borg
on screen
i am locutus of borg resistance is futile your life as it has been is over from this time forward you will service us
mister worf fire
to be continued
the best of both worlds part 

the next generation
mister worf dispatch a subspace message to admiral hanson we have engaged the borg
data fluctuate phaser resonance frequencies random settings keep them changing dont give them time to adapt
were coming with every available starship to assist captain but the closest help is six days away
all you know how to do is play it safe if you cant make the big decisions commander i suggest you make room for someone who can

if we can generate a concentrated burst of power at that same frequency distribution
how do we do that
the main deflector dish
shelby to enterprise weve found the captains uniform and his communicator
jeanluc
we were unable to retrieve him sir sir the captain has been altered by the borg
will hes alive if we could get him back to the ship i might be able to restore
this is our only chance to destroy them if they get back into warp our weapon is useless
i am locutus of borg from this time forward you will service us
mister worf fire
and now the conclusion

deflector power approaching maximum limits energy discharge in six seconds
firing sir

the borg ship is undamaged
impossible
warning warp reactor core primary coolant failure
cant maintain it much longer commander
warning exceeding reaction chamber thermal limit
cease fire
shutting down warp engines
they couldnt have adapted that quickly
the knowledge and experience of the human picard is part of us now it has prepared us for all possible courses of action your resistance is hopeless number one
first officers log stardate  the borg ship has resumed its course toward earth we are unable to pursue pending repairs to the enterprise

as we anticipated the blast burned out our main navigational deflector we also have damage to our shields and our reactor core
we should be back up in eight to twelve hours admiral
well well miss you at the party
the enterprisell be there sir maybe a little late but well be there sir
your engagements have given us valuable time weve mobilised a fleet of forty starships at wolf three five nine and thats just for starters the klingons are sending warships hell weve even thought about opening communications with the romulans
you realise admiral that with the assistance of captain picard the borg will be prepared for your defences
lieutenant a few years ago i watched a freshman cadet pass four upper classman on the last hill of the forty kilometre run on danula two the damndest thing i ever saw the only freshman to ever win the academy marathon i made it my business to get to know that young fellow i got to know him very very well and ill tell you something i never met anyone with more drive determination or more courage than jeanluc picard there is no way in hell that he would assist the borg i want that clear
of course admiral
he is a casualty of war
then we have abandoned all hope of recovering him
in less than twenty four hours this armadas going to hit that borg vessel with everything we can muster either they survive or we do as for picard a great man has been lost your captain my friend commander riker i hereby promote you to the field commission of captain the enterprise is your ship now congratulations i wish the circumstances were different
likewise good luck admiral
to us all



mister crusher suggests we might design a chip that would automatically retune the phasers to a random setting after each discharge engineering
that would be a great advantage
we should also see if theres some way that we can neutralise their forcefields weve got to let them know that we can adapt too mister worf were no longer just fighting the borg were fighting the life experience theyve stolen from captain picard now how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves
the borg have neither honour nor courage that is our greatest advantage
i hope its enough

accelerator coils are responding normally
excellent forward shields at fifty eight percent aft shields sensors must be down
checking sensors are fine no aft shields have completely failed damn it auxiliary generators are out again
just the man i need were having some problems with the aft shields generators going on and offline i could really use your help worf
how soon do we get underway geordi
still a couple hours commander shelby can fill you in
the main navigational deflector is functional again sherbourne and barclay are running through the final testing sequence now
the warp reactor core
reconstruction is proceeding normally its slow work if we can nail down this shield generator problem i agree with la forge we should be at operating capacity in two to three hours
good
anything else sir
yes you did a good job on the borg ship
i didnt get picard
you stopped them you gave us our shot
sir i
commander we dont have to like each other to work well together as a fact of fact id like you to continue to keep me on my toes
some might define that as the role of a first officer
damn you are ambitious arent you shelby
captain riker based on our past relationship theres no reason for me to expect to become your first officer except you need me i know how to get things done and i have the expertise in the borg
and you have a lot to learn commander
yes sir
almost as much as i had to learn when i came aboard as captain picards first officer a fact he reminded me of when i commented on what a pain in the neck you are
yes sir
data to riker message from starfleet captain
go ahead data
starfleet reports

it has engaged the borg at wolf three fifty nine sir

admiral hanson on subspace captain
on screen admiral

the fight does not go well enterprise were attempting to withdraw and regroup rendezvous with fleet

captains log stardate  repairs are complete and the enterprise is warping to rendezvous with starfleet at wolf three five nine communications from the site of battle have been cut off possibly by borg interference

lieutenant worf everyone in this room shares my respect for your service to this ship but right now i need your experience at tactical commander data i realise your very nature omits ambition nevertheless i want you to know i seriously considered you first officer
thank you sir
but this is not the time for change i need you all where you are where captain picard always relied on you i have been reluctantly forced to conclude that commander shelby our expert on the borg is an ideal choice at this time for first officer based on our latest communication we can assume that the borg survived the fleets attack your thoughts on our next encounter
what about the heavy graviton beam we were talking about
ive gone over it four times the local field distortion just wouldnt be strong enough to incapacitate them
doctor crusher and i have been working on an interesting premise
with our recent experience in nanotechnology we might be able to introduce a destructive breed of nanites into the borg
nanites
robots small enough to enter living cells
how long would it take to execute that
thats the problem two to three weeks
in two or three weeks nanites may be all thats left of the federation
we have the new phaser adapters
maybe in concert with photon torpedoes we can slow them down
im sure captain picard would have something meaningful and inspirational to say right now to tell you the truth i wish he were here because id like to hear it too i know how difficult this transition has been for all of you i can take over for him but i could never replace captain picard nor would i ever try whatever the outcome im sure our efforts in the coming battle will justify his faith in all of us dismissed

 what would you do

come
may i speak to you captain
actually guinan i
you know picard and i used to talk every now and again when one of us needed to i guess im just used to having the captains ear

whats on your mind
ive heard a lot of people talking down in ten forward they expect to be dead in the next day or so they trust you they like you but they dont believe anyone can save them
im not sure anyone can
when a man is convinced hes going to die tomorrow hell probably find a way to make it happen the only one who can turn is around is you
ill do the best i can
youre going have to do something you dont want to do you have to let go of picard
maybe you havent heard i tried to kill him yesterday
you tried to kill whatever that is on the borg ship not picard picard is still here with us in this room if he had died it would be easier but he didnt they took him from us a piece at a time did he ever tell you why were so close
no
well then let me just our relationship is beyond friendship beyond family and i will let him go and you must do the same there can only be one captain
its not that simple this was his crew he wrote the book on this ship
and the borg know everything he knows its time to throw that book away you must let him go riker its the only way to beat him the only way to save him and that is now you chair captain

were approaching the wolf system captain

sir i must remind you that captain picard was briefed on that plan the borg will be prepared for it
im aware of that commander in fact im counting on it
crusher cartaino gleason report to the battle bridge
mister data mister worf i have a special mission for you


locutus of borg this is captain william t riker of the uss enterprise
you may speak

we wish to end the hostilities
then you must unconditionally surrender
we are prepared to meet to discuss your terms
it is unlikely you are prepared to discuss terms it is more likely that this is an attempt at deception
come now locutus if picards knowledge and experience is part of you then you know ive never lied to him you should also implicitly trust me is that not so
picard implicitly trusted you
then trust me now meet to discuss terms
discussion is irrelevant there are no terms you will disarm all your weapons and escort us to sector zero zero one where we will begin assimilating your culture and technology

mister gleason can you pinpoint the source of the borg transmission
i can put you within thirty meters of it sir
obrien report

the borg have adapted their electromagnetic field to prevent main transporter functions sir
as expected mister data mister worf proceed as we discussed
aye captain


channel open sir
we would like time to prepare our people for assimilation
preparation is irrelevant your people will be assimilated as easily as picard has been your attempt at a delay will not be successful number one we will proceed to earth and if you attempt to intervene we will destroy you
then take your best shot locutus because were about to intervene

captain weve sustained damage to the impulse drive

the saucer section is disabled
reading subspace field fluctuations from the borg ship looks like theyre getting ready to increase power
stand by mister la forge
aye sir
the saucer sections a sitting duck
prepare to draw their fire
captain the borg ship is moving away its resuming its course to earth sir
rendezvous with the saucer section lay in a course of pursuit

there is extensive infiltration of microcircuit fibers into the surrounding tissue his dna is being rewritten
can you revive him
id like more time to study the structural changes in the motor pathways
we dont have more time doctor once he was wired into the borg they knew everything that he knew i just hope it goes both ways if were lucky he had access to everything we need to know about them especially their vulnerabilities
jean luc its beverly can you hear me
beverly crusher doctor
yes dont try to move
i am on board the enterprise
thats right

 a futile manoeuvre incorrect strategy number one to risk your ship and crew to retrieve only one man picard would never have approved you underestimate us if you believe this abduction is any concern there is no need for apprehension i intend no harm no harm i will continue aboard this ship to speak for the borg while they continue without further diversion to sector zero zero one where they will force your unconditional surrender

using multimodal reflection sorting i have been able to detect a complex series of subspace signals between locutus and the borg ship
thats how theyre controlling him
it is not just a matter of control doctor the signals are interactive across a subspace domain similar to that of a transporter beam i would hypothesise that these frequencies form the basis of the borgs collective consciousness
cant we block them
possibly but as you may recall on several occasions we have witnessed the borg removing key circuits from injured comrades no doubt separating them from the group consciousness
the injured borg immediately selfdestructed
that is correct sir
cutting the link to locutus might be fatal to the captain
we have to find a way to reach him we must know what he knows
without these interactive signals it would only be a matter of microsurgery i could do it but as long as those borg implants are functioning theres no way i can separate the man from the machine
then perhaps there is a way i can access the machine doctor

worf klingon species a warrior race you too will be assimilated
the klingon empire will never yield
why do you resist we only wish to raise quality of life for all species
i like my species the way it is
a narrow vision you will become one with the borg you will all become one with the borg the android data primitive artificial organism you will be obsolete in the new order

take him to your lab data
shelby to riker
go ahead

captain the borg have entered sector zero zero one

the borg have dropped out of warp sir jupiter outpost nine two reported visual contact at twelve hundred hours thirteen minutes
planetary defences
responding no reports on effectiveness but i cant believe that against the borg
ensign crusher at their current speed when will they reach earth
twenty seven minutes
the soonest we could intercept
forty two minutes sir
riker to data

whats your status
the initial cybernetic connection into captain picards neural net pathways has been established mister obrien is ready to process the borg signal through the transport pattern buffer
make it so with dispatch mister data
proceeding immediately sir data out

the neural link will be established in three stages doctor i suggest you closely observe captain picards lifesigns while at each stage chief obrien monitors my positronic matrix activity counsellor hopefully you will be able to determine whether i am reaching captain picard
at what point should i shut it down if theres a problem
i do not know i have never done this before initiating first neural link
the captains vital signs are stable
positronic activity unchanged
first neural connection is confirmed i cannot report any significant access to the borg consciousness



it is confirmed the borg have broken through the mars defence perimeter
enterprise now approaching terran system sir
slow to impulse time to intercept
twentythree minutes fourteen seconds sir

second neural connection is confirmed i still cannot report any significant access proceeding with the final link
significant increase in premotor area and hypothalamus activity his heartbeat is accelerating rapidly
sir your submicron matrix activity is increasing exponentially
neural connections complete i have access to the borg subspace signals processing processing
data
stand by processing processing fascinating the borg group consciousness is divided into subcommands necessary to carry out all functions defence communication navigation they are all controlled by a root command implanted into each

data im picking up increased neural activity in captain picard localised in the prefrontal and parietal lobes
the borg might be trying to terminate their link with him
negative the subspace signal configuration is unchanged what is causing the increased neural activity is unclear
no its not its him its picard

troi to bridge

data has made first contact with captain picard
can you communicate with him data

i have been unable to create a neural path around the borg implants sir it is captain picard himself who has somehow managed to initiate contact

sir the borg have halted their approach to earth
i think we got their attention
time to intercept
two minutes four seconds sir
theyre worried theyre worried because weve got access to picard mister data we have two minutes to figure out what we can do with it

sir it is clear the borg are either unwilling or unable to terminate their subspace links
that may be their achilles heel captain their interdependency

what do you mean doctor
hes

part of their collective consciousness now cutting him off would like asking one of us to disconnect an arm or a foot

we cant do it
they operate as a single mind
one jumps off a cliff they all jump off data is it possible to plant a command into the borg collective consciousness

it is conceivable sir but it would require altering the pathway from the root command

to affect all iterative branch points in the
make every effort mister data
sir

what command shall i try to plant

something straightforward like disarm your weapons systems

commander shelby take an away team and confirm that the borg are asleep
delighted sir mister worf


shelby to enterprise its true theyre all in a regeneration mode

theyre dormant sir
any indication to how long we can keep them like this

checking
tricorder readings are fluctuating rapidly commander
shelby to enterprise there are indications here that their entire power nets about to feed back on itself id say were looking at a selfdestruct sequence activated by the borgs malfunction do you want us to attempt to disarm it

stand by
theres no way to know what the destruction of the borg ship will do to him
we should also consider the advantages of further examination of the borg and their vessel sir
i dont think so data separate yourself from captain picard away team get yourselves home mister crusher upon their return move us to a safe position
aye sir

life signs are stable the dna around the microcircuit fibre implants is returning to normal
how do you feel
almost human with just a bit of a headache
well get you to sickbay we wont have any trouble getting these implants out now
how much do you remember
everything including some brilliantly unorthodox strategy from a former first officer of mine


and earth station mckinley has advised theyre ready to begin refitting the enterprise
have they estimated time for repairs
five or six weeks

come
request permission to disembark sir
permission granted theyve picked a fine officer for the task force commander
well have the fleet back up in less than a year i imagine youll get your choice of any starfleet command sir
everyone is so concerned about my next job with all due respect commander sir my career plans are my own business and no one elses but its nice to know ill have a few options
i hope i have the fortune of serving with you again sir captain

course to station mckinley ready and laid in sir
make it so number one

suddenly human

captains log stardate  we have moved into sector two one nine four seven in response to a distress call from a talarian observation craft the alien vessel appears adrift and our initial scans have detected a lifethreatening radiation leak within its propulsion system

i get no further response from the vessel
maintain an open channel
doctor crusher and her assistants are waiting in transporter room three
sir may i remind you that during the galen border conflict it was a common tactic of the talarians was to abandon their observation craft rig them to self destruct
and issue a general distress call yes mister data i know
that particular guerrilla manoeuvre resulted in two hundred and nineteen fatalities over a three day period
is there any way to detect their selfdestruct device
negative sir the talarians employ a subspace proximity detonator it is not detectable by our scans
or the away teams tricorders right
captain the talarian warship the qmaire is responding to the distress call
position
halfway through the woden sector
itll take them hours to get here sir even at maximum warp
counsellor
there is life on board but its fading
number one assemble the rest of your away team prepare for immediate rescue operations
yes sir

ancillary power is failing
theyre nothing more than children
i am commander riker of the federation starship enterprise we will evacuate you and give you medical care you will not be harmed
enterprise prepping five talarian males for transport directly to sickbay trauma team stand by to receive injured we have radiation burns and possible respiratory distress
transport locked in and ready doctor
stand by for my orders
captain this appears to be a basic training ship five boys all teens all wearing uniforms
proceed with the evacuation number one
no other life signs aboard sir
commander quickly
what is it
this boy hes human
captains log supplemental we have completed emergency evacuation of four talarians and one human how this young man found himself in the company of these aliens remains a mystery


its jono right is that what i heard them call you im doctor crusher im just examining you for radiation injuries it wont hurt i have a son not much older than you perhaps youd like to meet him well jono you seem to have escaped radiation damage pretty lucky
doctor crusher

now how did this happen

what is it
theyre terrified

they all just started up
please may i have your attention please may i have your attention stop that immediately  well thats better now whats your name young man
he wont talk captain we havent been able to get through to him
captain  i am jono take me home to my captain take me home to endar

he managed to escape radiation trauma but the scan shows something else
what
two previously fractured ribs a broken arm and a low grade concussion there might be neurological impairment id like to examine him further jeanluc the talarians have been known to be ruthless to their enemies i think theres a real possibility they may have brutalised the child
isnt it possible the injuries were caused prior to his captivity
not likely hes been with them a long time long enough to assimilate their cultural traits and calcium trace patterns indicate the injuries took place during the past seven years
but if they have abused the boy why would he so devoutly wish to return to them
its not uncommon it was identified centuries ago as the stockholm syndrome



jono what is it jono i just suggested he take off his gloves suddenly he lost control
security we need some assistance down here in sickbay
jono
she wont leave me alone she keeps trying to dissect me
she was trying to help you
i dont want her help i should be back with my brothers send us back to captain endar
jono i want you to stop this immediately
yes captain
good thats better now if were to accomplish anything
data to picard
go ahead
we have received a subspace communiqu from starfleet command regarding the young human sir
very well doctor counsellor
lieutenant worf escort this young man to quarters he is to be confined there until further notice
yes doctor

why are you here klingon with them did they capture you too
they are not my captors they are my comrades
why do you take orders from a female
doctor crusher she is my superior officer
among my people a female can never outrank a man
you are human and among humans females can achieve anything the males can
i am no more human than you are i am talarian
you are confused

stop that
i will make the bnar the mourning until i am back with my brothers

by matching dna gene types starfleet was able to identify the boy as jeremiah rossa
rossa
as in admiral rossa
she is his grandmother captain he was born fourteen years ago on the federation colony galen four his parents connor and moira rossa were killed three years nine months later when their colony was overrun by talarian forces
i remember there were no survivors
the boy was listed as missing presumed dead
i heard another rossa was killed in action at the krasner outpost
tragedy seems to follow that family the admiral lost both her sons
and now shell have something to celebrate
captain if jeremiah is returned to his family in his present condition it would be a wrenching experience for everyone especially for him he needs to rediscover his identity make some connection with his roots
i agree do what you can to accomplish that counsellor
i dont think i can do anything captain
why not
trois right its very clear that the boy does not respond well to women
the talarians are a rigidly patriarchical society sir
jeremiah needs to build a relationship with a man a father figure with whom he can explore his origins and i think it should be you captain
oh no counsellor oh no counsellor i dont think so he needs someone who is trained in these things
but you are the only person with whom he has shown any connection if he is to find his humanity then you are the only one who can help him its up to you captain


jono jono why do you make that noise
it is the custom of my people when we are in distress
is it not also the custom of your people to listen to the wishes of their captain
yes
then as captain of the starship enterprise i ask you not to make that sound
yes sir
good well now thats cleared up lets er lets er lets get acquainted shall we what do you think of your room i know its a little sterile but if theres anything youd like pictures perhaps or games
this is a cage i am still your captive
oh no not at all i thought youd be comfortable here
are you going to return me to my captain
we will rendezvous with the warship qmaire at oh seven forty hours we will transfer the talarians to captain endar
including me
well discuss your situation with captain endar
i dont like this place
we could find some other quarters
ive always lived with my captain
ah yes well that wouldnt work here

well im sure youll see theres nothing here to appeal to a young person

put that down please
its klingon
yes would you put it back where you got it

well here we are eh jono
i notice you havent taken off your gloves
not here
why not
so that i dont have to touch an alien
jono your captain endar has he ever hurt you inflicted pain
pain is not a consideration
then he has
i did not say that dont you understand pain is not what matters passing the tests is everything
is that what they are tests of pain
you understand nothing
its true i dont fully understand talarians but you are not talarian
i will not listen to this i will not listen to your lies

come
you wanted to see me captain
yes counsellor please come in sit down

youre probably not aware of this but i have never been particularly comfortable around children
really
for some reason they just dont seem to respond to me
i see
frankly i think my time would be best served carrying out the duties and responsibilities of a starfleet captain
seldom have i heard an explanation so wellrehearsed
look counsellor i just feel that im not the right person for this job
strange isnt it youll travel light years dodge asteroid storms brave hostile aliens and yet when asked to assume a parental role you cringe why do you suppose that is
im not cringing im just acknowledging my limitations
when you were a child did you have any friends other children you played with
i dont think that has anything to do with anything well perhaps it was because this is foolish
what were you going to say
its just that ever since i was a child ive always known exactly what i wanted to do be a member of starfleet nothing else mattered to me virtually my entire youth was spent in the pursuit of that goal in fact i probably skipped my childhood altogether
you know captain almost no one is born being a good parent most people just have to muddle through and do the best that they can
are you saying thats what im going to have to do
yes and you might be surprised at just how good you can be




computer turn off that noise computer what was that
the alba ra a contemporary talarian musical form
jono jono where are you
you turned off my music
yes i certainly did and i expect it to stay turned off would you come down from there i see youve made yourself at home
i cannot rest on your beds they hurt my back
would you come here theres something i want to show you

those are connor and moira rossa they are your parents the baby is you jeremiah rossa
my name is jono
well you were born jeremiah on galen four the colony was destroyed later during a border skirmish

you see you knew how to laugh once do you remember any of this jono your parents your home
i know that endar rescued me he told me so
jono your parents were killed by talarians
it was war death is part of war
captain
yes what is it number one
weve established visual contact with the warship qmaire
endar
hey hey you stay put im on my way number one

get to cover
i cant leave you
take jeremiah take him to the forest ill hold them off
no no come with us jeremiah

are its weapons systems active
negative sir
captain endar requests an open channel sir
on screen
i am captain endar of the warship qmaire to whom am i speaking
captain jeanluc picard of the federation starship enterprise we have rescued four crew members from your observation craft they have received medical attention the are ready for transport
your actions are duly noted we will forward coordinates for immediate transport
youre welcome im sure
one moment captain weve also discovered a human among your crew
jono
actually his name is jeremiah jeremiah rossa
what is his condition is he injured
he was not wounded in the mishap but as a representative of the federation i require an explanation why has this child been held in your custody for so many years
no explanation is warranted captain he is my son
captains log supplemental captain endars claim that jeremiah rossa is his son is clearly unacceptable however to avoid escalating tensions i have invited the talarian leader to come aboard the enterprise so that we may address the issue face to face

yes i was in charge of the force that repelled the trespassers on galen four i must say your federation troops fought tenaciously
among them connor and moira rossa
i suppose after the battle i found this squalling child huddled by the body of a young woman his mother presumably there was almost no one left alive on galen four was i to leave him screaming by his mothers body
you should have notified the federation authorities to conceal him was a clear violation of our agreement
i took him in accordance with my peoples traditions
what tradition is it that empowered you to capture a helpless child
i lost my son at the hands of humans during the conflict over castal one talarian custom allows me to claim the son of a slain enemy
does that custom extend also to brutalising this surrogate son
what are you talking about
our medical officer discovered evidence of injuries so severe they might be considered torture
nonsense ive never harmed jono
then explain the fractured ribs concussion the broken arm
broken arm youth have you ever been a father picard have you ever had a son desperately try to win your approval your respect jono broke his ribs riding on a tstayan six hooves a very powerful beast the arm in a contest with other youths he endured the pain and won the competition one day he will be a great warrior
doesnt he deserve to become more than that his true heritage is human endar
a heritage long since forgotten
while on board you are welcome to supervise the return of your crew but i cannot allow jeremiah rossa to be returned to your custody his true family are waiting for him on earth
then under no circumstances will i allow your ship to leave our territory
i have already reported our position and the nature of this violation to starfleet
and ive already called for reserved forces into the sector
are you saying that youre willing to go to war over this boy
would you not for your only son
we have been at peace for many years let us not rush headlong into war
then help me to avoid it if you will allow me to see jono it will be clear to you i have been a good father he has grown up happy in my keeping

so you think it would be unwise to let endar see jono
i think its dangerous abusers can have subtle but powerful influence over their victims
you see im not convinced the boy has been abused doctor ive talked with the father and if i am any judge of character i would say that he deeply cares for the boys welfare
i sense awakening memories in the boy this is a very fragile time for jono if we send away the man he calls father without even letting them see each other how will we ever gain his trust
yes there is something else to keep in mind we are deep in talarian territory a semblance of diplomacy is called for im going to agree to the meeting
all i ask is that the visit be supervised dont let them be alone together
agreed


endar
jono my son

have they treated you well
yes captain except
except what
i was forbidden to make the bnar
thats all right i know youve mourned in your heart well jono what do you think of these humans
they look like me
they want to keep you you know
yes i know
youve reached the age of decision what is your choice do you want to stay
no of course not
then you shall not im returning to the qmaire i will give the humans with a choice if they do not make the one we know is right it may lead to war you may die
i am ready to die


captain sensors indicate two warships approaching from the opposite direction along the border
mister data whats their offensive potential
talarian warships are limited to neutral particle weapons high energy xray lasers and merculite rockets no match for the enterprise captain
the last thing i want is to be forced into destroying one of their ships
they wont back off theyve been willing to fight to the death in past encounters
the lines are being drawn all this for a chosen son
captain is it worth it to go to war over a child
you might not ask that lieutenant if it was your child
there must be a way to avoid this
if we can just reach jono help him make some connections with his origins he may choose to come with us
you really think endar would go along with that
if endar respects talarian custom he may have to according to their tradition a male child of fourteen has reached the age of decision he then undergoes a ceremony of initiation after which he has the freedom to make his own choices
endars entire claim on jono is based on talarian custom hed have a hard time backing away from it now
captain there is a subspace communication from starfleet command
on screen
sir the message is for jeremiah rossa
have the boy brought to my ready room


jeremiah my name is connaught rossa i am your fathers mother i wish we could talk in person but that will have to wait when i heard the miracle that you were alive i wanted to reach out to you as soon as possible i find myself wondering what you look like all i can do is imagine your father at your age you come from a family that would make you proud many of them have given their lives to bring peace to the galaxy you are the last of the rossas i was so very thankful when you were given back to us to carry on the line your grandfather and i will greet you with all the love in our hearts have a safe journey home jeremiah
she wears a starfleet uniform
yes
what is her rank
she is an admiral
she outranks you
yes
if i were home now i would go to the brae and run along the river run as fast as i could
jono
i cant do any of the things that calm me here you wont let me have my music you wont let me make the bnar i feel if i stay still much longer i will die
jono let me show you what i do when i get those feelings come on

now you can serve from within either of these two sections by bouncing the ball and hitting it into that top centre target you have to return the ball before it bounces twice alright lets try it

not bad
i win at all the games
i can believe it

jono you all right
im fine

momma
jeremiah
no momma
its all right its all right

she was all red i cried she didnt answer me

she used to sing to me i dont remember the melody just the sound of her voice before i remembered these things i was strong and now
its part of being human jono but as deeply as you can feel hurt you can also feel joy
i do not think so i think i will always feel like this


how was the racquetball
oh he gave me quite a game for his first time out
yes captain im looking forward to next time
im sure you are sit down what would you like
what is that
this is called a banana split its quite possibly one of the greatest things in the universe here try some
that is called a spoon

forgive me

i fail to understand why this is amusing
access your data banks under humour subheading slapstick
comedy stressing farce and horseplay ah this no doubt is a variation on pie in the face
now do you see why its funny
no sir but i will take your word for it it is very amusing
lets try this again id like a fresh banana split and another one for my friend here
right away

look at him hes a different person
who would have thought wed see him laugh out loud like that
just half an hour ago he was crying like a baby



two bleeders single plane penetration i need the autosuture here
yes doctor
looks like the blade hit the sternum and was deflected it could have been a lot worse
then it wasnt a dream
im afraid not no vital organs pierced no major arteries
where is the boy now
worf has him in security hold still
i want to see him here now
hell wait until im finished

talarian warships converging range five hundred kilometres
on screen any communication lieutenant worf
no sir we have an open channel
commander the warships closing velocities are slowing staggered approach vectors bearing zero one hundred twenty and two hundred forty degrees
riker to la forge
la forge here sir
the talarians are moving

into attack posture classic triangular envelopment
ive tapped the impulse engines for additional power to shields

were ready commander
commander the captain of the qmaire requests communication
here we go on screen
captain picard have you made your decision
this is commander riker what are your intentions captain endar
where is captain picard
he has been injured i am in command now
very well please prepare my son for immediate transport
im afraid that wont be possible last night jono attacked captain picard and tried to murder him were holding him in custody
if he had been returned to me with the others this would never have happened i hold you responsible for this incident
he will have to come with us now endar it is up to starfleet to decide the consequences
i do not accept that decision i repeat you will prepare my son for immediate transport if he is not aboard the qmaire in five minutes you will suffer the consequences

red alert
talarian vessels routing power to forward rockets
ready all weapons mister worf


jono why did you do it
that does not matter
yes i think it does it matters to me
what matters is that i have attacked a captain i am ready to be put to death
you think youre going to be killed
to attack a superior is the worst offence i will die at your hands
jono youre not going to die at my hands or anyone elses
but i have committed a terrible crime
what i want to know is why you seemed so happy just a few hours ago
i was then i thought about my father i felt i had betrayed him id be throwing away all that hes given me all that id learned from him my home running along the river playing in the games sharing victory with my brothers all the things that are part of my life as i grew closer and closer to you i knew that meant leaving more and more of that life behind forgive me captain but i could not allow myself to do that

the qmaire is requesting communication on a secure channel commander
on screen
commander riker you have failed to transport my son aboard the qmaire
our intentions have not changed endar were returning him to starfleet
i regret your stubbornness much will be lost
one moment captain captain endar last night jono attacked me with a dagger
which he could not have done had he been returned to me with the others
there was a crime committed on board this ship but it was not jonos it was mine when we found jono it seemed so clear what had to be done we knew that if only we could persuade him to make the decision to stay then you would most likely let him so with the best of intentions we tried to convince him and in so doing we thoroughly failed to listen to his feelings to his needs that was the crime and it has taken a huge toll on a strong and very noble young man and it must be rectified he will return home to the only home hes ever known and to the father that he loves to you endar
thank you captain
please transmit coordinates for immediate transport

goodbye jono
goodbye captain thank you

brothers

captains log stardate  due to a medical emergency we have been forced to cut short a two day liberty on ogus two and set course for starbase four one six it seems a young mans practical joke has come dangerously close to a lethal conclusion


well mister potts why dont we start at the beginning
we were at the arcade sir i brought this balloon with me filled with red pillion dye you see willie is always making fun of me i figured id get him back
hey hey slow down
we programmed the game for an ordinary laser duel you know twenty one points four points for a
im familiar with the game go on
we went out to the forest behind the east arcade i told willie that his laser pistol looked kind of funny almost like a real one when i went behind the trees i put the balloon into my vest and then
so you made your nine year old brother believe that hed killed you
yes sir
and then he ran away
yes sir
and while he was hiding he ate the fruit of a cove palm
it was just a joke sir i didnt think this was going to happen
are you aware of the infectious nature of the parasites which inhabit cove palm
i am i am now sir
are you also familiar with the terms i agreed to keep you boys on the enterprise when your parents went on sabbatical
that wed stay out of trouble sir
mister data
on my way sir
think about it mister potts and while youre at it think about what may have happened had we not been this close to a starbase medical facility

were you able to contact the boys parents
theyve been made fully aware of the situation sir
good escort this young man to the quarantine anteroom perhaps he could assist us in lifting his brothers spirits
aye sir

he really could die
fortunately we are only two days from starbase four one six and their laboratory can isolate

can isolate what sir

their laboratory can isolate what commander sir sir i know i made a mistake and i can tell youre angry but if youre not going to talk to me


back so soon mister data

la forge to bridge
go ahead commander
captain weve completed our dilithium vector calibrations we are currently at warp four point five youre clear to increase to warp seven
very good geordi let me know if you
captain did you request a course correction
i didnt say we could increase speed to warp nine point one sir
new course set for heading three four one mark two two one
course set by whom
not by me commander
whats going on
data who programmed the new coordinates
warp nine point three commander
i dont advise this captain

if were going to maintain our realignment progressions we shouldnt be pushing warp eight for at least an hour

commander

evacuate bridge deck one life support failure in thirty seconds
turbolifts two three four everyone
transfer helm to engineering geordi
aye sir
la forge lets get a diagnostic sweep underway
evacuate bridge deck one life support failure in twenty seconds
reassemble in engineering

evacuate bridge deck one life support failure in ten seconds

deck one life support has been terminated

our velocity is holding steady at warp nine point three do you wish to override commander
no not yet computer isolate cause of life support failure
atmosphere conditioning pumps on deck one are operating in negative mode
how could that be there are seven independent safety interlocks to prevent that

captain i believe weve found the problem but it really doesnt make sense
bring the enterprise to a full stop commander
aye sir full stop ensign
its not responding sir
im going to have to do this at the manual input level sir wes
were still at the altered heading captain holding at warp nine point three
captain force fields have been established on all main bridge turbolift doors and service crawlways
computer locate lieutenant commander data
commander data is on the main bridge
what the hell is he up to
number one take a security team up to deck two try and break through from below commander
everythings locked up captain we have no control of impulse or warp engines from here
navigations not responding either sir
picard to main bridge

commander data do you hear me i repeat data do you hear

computer recognise data lieutenant commander alpha one clearance
priority clearance recognition alpha one
maintain minimum auxiliary power and disengage subspace communications
acknowledged

he is on the bridge sir
mister la forge prepare for saucer separation
sir were at warp nine three
i am aware of the risks ensign when the umbilical splits we should regain primary control do you agree
yes sir
the saucer module should fall out of warp in two minutes be prepared to sweep back pull it in with a tractor beam
aye sir
initiate auto sequence

 computer recognise picard jeanluc alpha two clearance
priority clearance recognition alpha two
cancel separation sequence
sequence cancelled
isolate all remaining command functions and accept related orders and inquiries from main bridge only

the separation sequence has been aborted captain
computer recognise jeanluc picard alpha two priority and reestablish separation procedure immediately
orders regarding command functions are no longer accepted from your present location
and just what location are they accepted from
interface terminals on main bridge only
youre the only one who has clearance to localise command functions
it seems commander data has it them as well


the isolinear subprocessor extends three point five metres
ive got a clear path to panel j baker whats that going to do for us
j baker backs onto science station two commander
have they reinverted the environmental control sequencer
yes sir life support has been reestablished
then you and casey get up here lets get to it

computer configure a perimeter field charge sections nine k through twelve t


what the hell was that
hes activated a force field sir
great just great

chief obrien
yes captain
we had better disable the site to site transport function

when we get wherever were going i dont want mister data beaming off the bridge
ill get right to it sir

doctor crusher
yes captain
is your quarantine intact
so far sickbay force fields dont seem to have been affected
the boy


hes alright but hes not going to stay alright sir we have to get this ship to a starbase medical facility
it seems doctor

that data has other plans for the enterprise right now


oh come on i cant believe that everybodys played a practical joke on somebody at one time or another
not me
not even a little one how about april fools i cant believe that youre telling me that youve never tried to pull something even on april fools day
what for its never funny to the one getting fooled
well im sure your brother didnt intend for it too get out this of hand certainly not to the degree it has take a deep breath
whats so funny about making someone think you killed them
take a deep breath have you been drinking all the water i asked you to
yes
well keep it up there might have a short delay in reaching starbase and i want

there you see how can i tell him if hes not going to listen to me
why dont you try jake
its just a waste of time he wont listen



computer prepare to transport me directly to the following coordinates
site to site transport interlocks have been manually deactivated
can you override
negative
show me the shortest route to transporter room one computer prepare to activate cascade force field sequence in the following progression

no matter what we try the computer will only accept commands from the bridge sir
he has blocked every subspace channel sir we cannot even call for help
have you tried tracing back navigation inputs
we dont even know what star system were in sir
the only way we knew wed come out of warp was by looking out a window
obrien to captain picard
go ahead chief
captain hes up to something
what now

he discovered the site to site lockout i wouldnt be surprised if he

tried to make it to a transporter room now
mister worf i want security teams along the main passageways and in every transporter room and see if the computer would be good enough to give you the precise stun setting to disable mister data
yes sir
computer estimate the time from this location to starbase four one six at warp nine
inquiries regarding command functions are no longer accepted from your present location

 computer establish a security code for access to all functions previously transferred to bridge
enter code
one seven three four six seven three two one four seven six charlie three two seven eight nine seven seven seven six four three tango seven three two victor seven three one one seven eight eight eight seven three two four seven six seven eight nine seven six four three seven six lock
security code intact for all specified inquiries and orders
computer initiate cascade sequence accepting instructions from commander data en route  now

hes out security team approaching location


intersection eight j aft port establish

i order you to stop
computer begin scan phase

no no thats too close

this has gone far enough data
computer three metre cross seal

i wouldnt advise that sir the phase coils dont take well to ricochets
whats he doing
hes reactivating the site to site transport interlocks
does that mean hell be able to



youre right on time

open one of these and one of these there you are

i fail to recall how i arrived here
i sent for you in a manner of speaking
and who are you sir data to enterprise enterprise do you read me
i always loved that face please sit down
we were heading for a medical facility i was taking the boys brother to sickbay and
im sure your starship will be back for you soon please sit down
i must find a way to contact the enterprise
tell me do i look somewhat familiar to you
you do bear a resemblance to doctor noonian soong the cyberneticist who constructed me but doctor soong was killed shortly afterward by the crystalline entity

there we are its your lucky day data youve found your long lost father and hes alive what do you think of that
but the colony was destroyed there were no survivors
ive never felt too comfortable living anywhere without a prearranged route of escape i admit i wouldnt have guessed id be running from a giant snowflake but
it is really you

captain the quarantine field in sickbay
you have access to it
when he transferred force field control to the bridge he must have only specified fields he was planning to initiate the quarantine field was already operating
under normal circumstances we could divert that field energy and use it to cancel the force field protecting the bridge but we have to retain the medical quarantine
determine the absolute minimum field energy doctor crusher needs and use the rest to get me onto my bridge

how are you this morning
not so great im having trouble standing up i get sort of dizzy
you heard the old story about the man who goes to his doctor he says doctor it hurts when i raise my arm like this the doctor says then dont raise your arm like that
so if i get dizzy standing up
then dont stand up
okay doc were ready if all goes well you shouldnt notice a thing
make sure it goes well commander

your brother tells me that you still wont speak to him
so
its very hard on him too he feels very guilty about what happened hes your brother
why is everybody so worried about him im the one whos sick im the one whos going to die
hey nobody is going to die willie do you hear me nobody

captain we are in
were on our way lieutenant
computer restore tactical station
deactivation of command function overrides requires alpha two clearance

beverly thinks its going to be tight lets hope he didnt take us too far off course
lets hope

it wont answer to my clearance sir
computer this is captain picard return all command functions to the stations
alpha two clearance recognised please enter security code
security code
data i was afraid of something like this
sensors are operative
well at least thats something what have you got
no fix on data but i am picking up a single life form on the surface sir it appears human
thats a human that has the answers to a lot of questions
something else
what is it
a small vessel entering orbit i detect no lifeforms aboard sir


good good good good keep it up keep it up old tom handy swore youd never master that data data whistle for me

oh well all right thats enough sit down  beautiful beautiful you know ive been able to keep track of you from time to time youve become something of a celebrity in cybernetic circles data why starfleet
sir
i gave you the ability to choose whatever you wanted to do whatever you wanted why starfleet
it was starfleet officers who rescued me
ah so you decided to emulate your emancipators huh how disappointing
what choice of vocation would have met with your approval sir
well i often hoped you might become a scientist perhaps even a cyberneticist
to follow in your footsteps as it were
i see nothing wrong with that
may i ask you a question sir
certainly anything you like
why did you create me
why does a painter paint why does a boxer box you know what michelangelo used to say that the sculptures he made were already there before he started hidden in the marble all he needed to do was remove the unneeded bits it wasnt quite that easy with you data but the need to do it my need to do it was no different than michelangelos need now let me ask you a question why are humans so fascinated by old things
old things
old buildings churches walls ancient things antique things tables clocks knick knacks why why why
there are many possible explanations
if you brought a noophian to earth hed probably look around and say tear that old village down its hanging in rags build me something new something efficient but to a human that old house that ancient wall its a shrine something to be cherished again i ask you why
perhaps for humans old things represent a tie to the past
whats so important about the past people got sick they needed money why tie yourself to that
humans are mortal they seem to need a sense of continuity
ah hah why
to give their lives meaning a sense of purpose
and this continuity does it only run one way backwards to the past
i suppose it is a factor in the human desire to procreate
so you believe that having children gives humans a sense of immortality do you
it is a reasonable explanation to your query sir
and to yours as well data

lore
looks like we have ourselves a family reunion

open
i implore you do not reactivate him
dont be ridiculous data lore is far from the maniacal android you have made him out to be in any case hell obey me he always did
but he admitted to an alliance with the crystal entity to gain its favour he betrayed the colonists and would have betrayed the enterprise as well had i not
shh one more that should do it

so youre still alive im surprised you woke me why didnt you just take me apart again and be done with it that is why the two of you captured me isnt it
data had nothing to do with this lore and nobody captured you not exactly that is you see both of your brains contain a simple homing device datas was activated purposefully yours well until you walked through that door i had no idea youd ever been reassembled
no thanks to you but thanks to you dear brother i spent nearly two years drifting in space if it hadnt been for a fortunate encounter with a pakled trade ship id still be out there
i had no alternative you would have destroyed the enterprise
well since i appear to be an uninvited guest at your little party ill leave you with your beloved son and be on my way
lore wait there are questions i can answer youll have no chance to ask them later you see im dying

yes im dying
dying from what sir
wait a minute wait a minute what do you mean youre dying you look fine youre not that old you look fine what is this some kind of a trick
i wish it were

we have control of sensors life support and auxiliary power captain nothing more
the code mister la forge
we cant even locate the file address at least that would tell us how many digits were talking about not that it would really help
i want something that will really help
and quickly too willie potts has twenty four hours thirty six tops if it goes much longer than that the only thing left for starbase four one six will be to do a postmortem
geordi if the computers programmed to allow data to transport down it would figure that it would allow him to beam back up right
it would figure
and data would have left a trace imprint when he beamed down
sure everyone does
so what would be involved in pulling that trace and finding a way to make the computer think someone else is data maybe a few someone elses
wed have to access the transport controller reset it to a testing mode convince it that its back in school accepting simulated inputs thats not going to be easy without the main computer but i suppose we could network a few tricorders together
try mister la forge
yes sir

you did what you had to do what kind of answer is that
the only one i can give you you were not functioning properly
lore told me the colonists envied him because you made him so completely human
i wouldnt exactly have used the word envious data
you disassembled me you took me apart
lore also told me the colonists petitioned you to replace him with a less perfect android
the last thing you should think of yourself as data is less perfect the two of you are virtually identical except for a bit of programming
it was a lie another lie
i would have proven myself worth to you if youd just given me a chance but it was easier just to turn your back and build your precious data
you were the first you meant as much to me as data ever did but you were unstable the colonists were not envious of you they were afraid of you you were unstable
i am not less perfect than lore
why didnt you just fix me it was within your power to fix me
it wasnt as easy as that the next the next logical step was to construct data afterward i planned to get back to you to fix you
next logical step
i am not less perfect than lore
i am not less perfect than lore
enough both of you sit down sit down for all these years ive been plagued by what went wrong with all of your complexities lore your nuances basic emotions seemed almost simple by comparison but the emotion turned and twisted became entangled with ambition lore if i had known you were no longer sitting in pieces on some distant shelf if i had known that i could simply press a button and bring you here i would have spent those years trying to make things right for you as well but all i knew of was data so i worked long and hard and now i believe ive succeeded this is why i brought you here data basic emotions simple feelings data your feelings ive imagined how hard its been for you living amongst beings so moved by emotion

i dont have to imagine i know how hard its been youd be surprised data feelings do funny things you may even learn to understand your evil brother to forgive him we will be more alike data you and i youll see im happy for you
i question your sincerity lore
perhaps with this youll learn to be more trusting data your brother has had good reason to be bitter
but sir lore was responsible for
he wasnt given the chance that you and i were given to live but now im sure he understands why i had to do what i had to do
if there were only time lore what a shame the procedure is quite simple im tired i need to rest first im tired


theyre sure this is going to work
nobody knows the transporters better than obrien and la forge they tell me theyve managed more than a little sleight of hand with our authorisation codes
they can insert them into the recall loop
the computer should think all three of us are data

i just hope we dont all beam back looking like data
whenever you say sir
bring him home number one energise



data
 the sons of the prophet were valiant and bold and quite unaccustomed to fear but of all the most reckless or so i am told was abdul abulbul amir
how do you feel
ive always loved that ditty i could never quite get the cadence right thank you father
you called me father
what would you prefer i called you often wrong
what did lore tell you about that
that is what the colonists called you isnt it often wrong soong its a very sloppy rhyme wrong soong wrong soong it just doesnt work lets see
data how you are feeling
often wrongs got a broken heart cant even tell his boys apart
lore
well well well well well youre not as feeble as i thought you were
this wont work those circuits they werent designed for you wheres data
wheres data you didnt fill data with substandard parts did you old man no that honour was bestowed upon me you owe me old man not him me
it was not meant for you youre not listening to me it must be removed
nice try often wrong nice try  i dont know exactly what its doing but its doing something
i didnt know you were alive if i had

there were brave men aplenty all well known to fame who served in the ranks of the tsar


the human is here
and data
no way of knowing
set them on stun

down here
worf

its all right take it easy
this this is doctor noonian soong
thats impossible soongs dead
no im telling you look at this stuff its soong all right

here let me

would you mind telling me whats going on here
he surprised me
commander
what has happened here doctor doctor soong
so alike he saw i couldnt tell you apart there was only one chip i tried to tell him but i couldnt if i wanted to i couldnt build another one
tried to tell who damn it data whats going on
lore sir he was inadvertently summoned here by the same signal which activated my homing circuitry it seems that after nearly two years in interstellar space he was
mister data theres a very sick little boy onboard the enterprise whos not getting any better were dead in the water until you get us out of here
its all right access your third nested memory file and execute instruction five one five five that will clear your memory block
i was unaware of having caused any inconvenience sir
well discuss it later mister data doctor youre coming with us too you need to get to sickbay
young man ive lived here a long time i have no plans to die anywhere else
but sir our medical facility may be able to
go go go go data go go with your friends
may i say goodbye to doctor soong sir alone sir

everybody dies data well almost everybody
do you believe that we are in some ways alike sir
yes in many ways id like to believe
then it is alright for you to die because i will remain alive you know that i cannot grieve for you sir
you will in your own way goodbye goodbye data
goodbye father
captains log stardate  we have been at starbase four one six for three days young willie potts is responding well to treatment and has been returned to the enterprise

the transfer went well
hell remain in quarantine for another week or two but hes out of the woods
splendid


mister data i see you gifts have been well received
yes sir the boys appear to have reconciled their differences
theyre brothers data brothers forgive
family

stardate  the enterprise remains docked at mckinley station undergoing a major overhaul and refit following the borg incident i am confident that the ship and her crew will soon be ready to return to service

thank you please take that to engineering

phaser upgrades are complete commander
already
and we have begun power supply calibration
youre just too damned efficient lieutenant
thank you sir
continue with the testing mister worf heres the final schedule for the shore leave and for the personnel transfers by the way im looking forward to meeting your parents
sir
theyre on the visitors list you didnt know
no sir it is inappropriate for a klingon to receive family while on duty as humans my parents do not understand
well im not sure that i would either worf since this isnt a klingon ship if you dont want to see your parents thats your business but we dont get to earth all that often im sure we can arrange for you to have more off duty time while theyre here
no sir that will not be necessary
dismissed mister worf if youre worried that they might learn about what happened on the klingon planet
not at all i have already informed them by correspondence of my discommendation i do not believe any human can truly understand my dishonour


so where have you decided to go
hmm what oh er france labarre my home village
really
yes its the first time in almost twenty years
interesting
counsellor
i just find it interesting captain jeanluc picard the man who couldnt be pried out of his seat for a vacation for three years
its earth its home do i need another reason
i dont know what do you think
your help has been invaluable during my recovery but look im better the injuries are healing
those you can see in the mirror
the nightmares have ended all i need now is a little time to myself
i agree in fact im delighted youre going its just that the choice of where youre going could stand some scrutiny
if you wish to believe that my going home is a direct result of being held captive by the borg be my guest
is that what you believe
i hate it when you do that
captain you do need time you cannot achieve complete recovery so quickly and its perfectly normal after what youve been through to spend a great deal of time trying to find yourself again
and what better place to find oneself than on the streets of ones home village
interesting have a good trip captain


they still have not signalled
no sir
my mother is never on time it is so human of her
well you know women
i am not looking forward to this i wish they would come so it would begin and end sooner
i know what you mean lieutenant
unlikely
last time my old man was on board i found him chasing nurse stanton around a biobed in sickbay
i am not concerned about my father chasing nurses
yeah but its always something with parents isnt it
enterprise this is earth station bobruisk two to transport aboard
energising

mother father
worf
you look good son put on a little weight huh
no
sure you have looks good on you still working out with those holodeck monsters i bet
let me take you to
always good to meet another chief petty officer sergey rozhenko formerly of the uss intrepid

miles edward obrien sir good to meet you
dont call me sir i used to work for a living
hes joking the proudest day of his life was when worf earned his commission
can you imagine an old enlisted man like me raising a boy to be an officer
come on sergey theres plenty of time to chat with the boys your father has been so looking forward to this
yes i want to see everything the whole ship at home i have all the specs and diagrams of the galaxyclass starships
we are in the midst of a repair i cannot give you a complete tour
im sure if you asked the captain
you agreed not to embarrass him besides we have come to see worf not the ship
fine fine okay
your hairs a little longer isnt it worf


all right whoever you are i can hear you

oh good lord a highwayman
a what
a highwayman its a robber who attacks travellers but none have been reported in this vicinity for centuries
but im not a robber
i am much relieved sir

i know who you are
then you have the advantage
youre my nephew jeanluc from the starship enterprise
then you must be my uncle rene
im not your uncle its the other way around
too bad i rather enjoyed the idea
why have you been away so long
well starfleet keeps me very busy
father says you dont like it here
im sure you misunderstood
no i didnt he said so
well robert and i we perhaps its time to change all that
you know you dont seem so arrow arrow you know
arrogant
yes arrogant you dont seem that way to me what does it mean anyway arrogant son of a
lets talk about that later shall we

mummy hes here mummy hes here
jeanluc
marie
it is so good to finally meet you
for me too
how are you feeling
oh im fine
well robert and i are delighted that youve come to stay with us
i was i was thinking i i might be imposing i could very easily stay in the village
i wouldnt hear of it its your home and it will always be your home do things look that different

no in fact its amazing how little it has changed everything is exactly as i remember it the house the hills every tree every bush seems untouched by the passage of time
roberts worked hard to keep it that way its very important to him
as it was to our father
someday im going to be a starship captain
you look exactly like robert when he was your age i half expect to see myself as a boy come running out that door to play
robert cant wait to see you
rene already told me where is he
as usual with his vines


so you arrived all right welcome home captain
hello robert
youve shuttled in from the village
no i decided to walk i met marie and rene
good good
its good to see you
are you tired
no
make yourself at home you know where everything is we generally eat about eight i must try and cure this poor sick vine ill see you shortly

so youll have a chance to visit the surface
maybe will and i have been talking about going back to angel falls
oh venezuelas beautiful

come in

great thank you

something from home
i left it here in storage a long time ago after jack died odds and ends mostly
 how to advance your career through marriage
it was a joke jack sent it to me while i was still in medical school it was his way of proposing to me
whats that
its for wesley from jack id forgotten it maybe i was just trying to forget it
why
jack recorded a holographic message to wesley just after he was born it was a gift for when he grew up jack was going to make many more of them he never had the chance
are you afraid of what it might say
no i just dont know if itll do more harm than good wesleys finally come to terms with his fathers death
wesley has a lot of questions about his father things that you cant answer for him perhaps seeing this will help him understand

check completed sir
so we walked into the school and we dont know what to expect is worf hurt is he in some kind of trouble the door opens and there is our little seven year old sitting on a chair and glaring across the room at five teenage boys all of them with bloody noses
and then the principal looked up and said please tell me hes an only child
we have taken enough of the commanders time
no no no were way ahead of schedule here
i just wanted to tell him the story about
enough stories sergey
okay okay enough stories well how about giving us a look at the new engine core i used to be a warp field specialist on the old excelsior class
id be delighted mrs rozhenko
no no no no no you two go ahead your father will be hours worf why dont you show me the arboretum
commander la forge call me when you when my father wishes to leave
i can find my own way turbolift four is just over there right i have all the specs and designs at home

the thetamatrix compositer makes the recrystallisation process ten times more efficient than the old excelsior class ships
amazing commander if you have a couple of minutes there is something else i want to ask you
sure chief
its about my son


your friend louis wants you to contact him as soon as youre settled
is he still trying to raise the ocean floor
oh yes hes very excited about it hes been made a supervisor now as his wife is constantly reminding anyone wholl listen
i see no good reason why the earth should have another subcontinent
its really quite exciting actually if you understand the potential of exploring a new world on our own planet
well im afraid that i do not understand this potential
the mayor wants to give you a parade
a parade
give you the keys to the city
no no no no no
he just needs a little arm twisting dear coaxing
no he does not im here to rest and spend some time with my family
well ive already warned the mayor not to make any plans without talking to us
salut

is this the forty six
forty seven youve been drinking too much of that artificial stuff what do you call it synthehol its spoiled you ruined your palate
on the contrary i think that synthehol heightens ones appreciation for the genuine article
delicious marie
thank you
leave it to robert to find the best cook in france then marry her
yes but sadly cooking is becoming a lost art thats your wretched technology again
robert and i have had more than a few discussions about getting a replicator in the house
i remember the same discussions between mother and father
father understood better than anybody else the danger of losing those values which we hold most precious
i dont see that you have to lose anything just by adding a convenience
you wouldnt but in my view life is already too convenient
this is a very old argument
i wrote a report on starships for school
and he won a ribbon for it
the teacher said it was one of the best hed ever heard
good for you uncle you know what i once wrote a report about starships when i was about your age
did you win a ribbon too
i dont recall
and i dont find your modesty very unconvincing brother of course you won the ribbon you always did
do you still have it your report
no i dont think so
well i still have mine
why dont you go and get it and then you can read it to your uncle

its hard enough to protect him protect him from all thats out there without you encouraging him
i am not encouraging him if you werent so narrow minded if you allowed him to see the world as it really is
you raise your own sons as you would wish and allow me to do the same with mine

one mans idea of paradise
no my dear louis two men roberts and my fathers
never did i know anyone less interested in grapes than you jeanluc
no not true i was interested and i was proud that my family were helping to preserve the traditions i just didnt feel bound by those traditions
you always reached for the future and your brother for the past
there should be room for both in this life and what about you you old rascal youve taken quite a shift into the future yourself
well hydroponics turned out to be so dull
you should have listened to me at the beginning
if i had listened to you i never would have taken that cycling trip with the bloom sisters
and broken your leg
and got married twice
i hear youve been promoted to supervisor of the atlantis project
im one of two hundred supervisors although my wife would have you believe i run the entire project
well its certainly very exciting work ive kept up on it in the journals
really
its only theres just one thing i dont understand you were such a rotten swimmer louis thinking of you working on the ocean floor
i suppose we all find ways to confront our greatest fears
seriously how do you plan to accelerate the buildup on the underside of the mantle without increasing the stress on the tectonic plates
you really have kept up havent you the truth is we dont know yet
on the enterprise we used harmonic resonators to relieve the tectonic pressures on drema four obviously its not the same problem but
you know its such a shame the government is looking for someone to take over the project a real leader wholl go in there and get things moving and they are looking for you jeanluc i know i know youd never leave starfleet
no id never leave starfleet
thats what i thought but if nothing else why dont i send over some of the internal studies of the tectonic problem since youre interested we could use any thoughts you might have
all right


its a great crew son and they think the world of you
they really do
mother father i wish you would be a little more reserved while you are on board
i know we go too far sometimes
were just excited to be here
riker to lieutenant worf
worf here
i need to talk to you about the phaser test results
on my way commander have guinan call me if you need anything

maybe we should just leave it alone
i cant just leave it alone im his mother
you know sooner or later everyone comes in here they stand by those windows and they look out and the stare theyre looking for that little star they call home it doesnt matter how far away it is everybody looks anyway im guinan pleased to meet you youre worfs parents
sergey and helena rozhenko
welcome sit please theres something i would like to ask you
please
how come you never gave him prune juice
i beg your pardon
he said hed never had it till he came here mow he cant get enough of it
worf
he never wanted any human food while he was growing up everything had to be klingon
i learned to cook rokeg blood pie
however we never quite learned how to eat it
it was a difficult adolescence
but you got through it
we didnt do anything special
didnt you just look at him i think hes pretty special
we knew it wouldnt be easy for him growing up without other klingons to go to for guidance
we had to let him discover and explore his heritage by himself let him find his own path
so many parents could learn so much from the two of you
well im afraid that worf feels that we do not understand him
well part of him may feel that way but theres another part that ive seen a part that comes in and drinks prune juice a part that looks out the window towards home hes not looking toward the klingon empire hes looking toward you


jean luc are you all right
i seem to have made a rather disturbing discovery louis mentioned the atlantis project needed a director and i found myself actually thinking about it
why shouldnt you
leaving my career the enterprise
considering what youve just been through
no its not that or is it
besides it would be wonderful to have you back home given a little time maybe you and your brother might even get to like one another
well i already like his choice in wives i never thanked you for your correspondence it made me feel like part of the family
youre not like part of the family you are part of the family jean luc picard

dont worry my dear ive got it
robert
louis come in let me get you some wine you can talk business
business
well theres nothing much to talk about
im interested to know what you thought about our plans
ive only had a chance to glance at them ive a few ideas
wonderful we should discuss them with the board of governors ive set up a meeting
meeting
just a preliminary conversation tomorrow morning
preliminary to what
they want you i mentioned your interest in the project thats all thats all i had to say they jumped at the prospect
i never said there was a prospect
at least listen to them jeanluc
all right very good fine ill listen
you wont regret it jeanluc i promise you ill see you in the morning

i dont understand mom what kind of message
i dont know exactly your father made it a few weeks after you were born
why
he felt it was important to say certain things and to make sure that he didnt forget to tell you later
do you know what it says
no but he wanted you to have this when you turned eighteen and i want you to have it too

enter
are we disturbing you
no no i thought you were going to your quarters to sleep
we just came by to tuck you in
please when i heard you were on the visitors list i was not sure i wanted you to come i am glad you are here
we had to come
our boy was in trouble after we read your letter about the discommendation from the klingons
we dont exactly understand it all
we dont have to we know what kind of man you are
whatever you did we know it was for a good reason
i must bear my dishonour alone
that is not true
im sorry if this is too human of us but whenever you are suffering you must remember we are with you
and that were proud of you and that we love you
youre our son


careful youre not used to drinking the real thing this synthehol never leaves you out of control is that so
thats so
this will  now there is something id like to see
whats that
the gallant captain out of control mind if i ask you a question what the devil happened to you up there
is this brotherly concern
no curiosity what did they do to you
you know what happened
not precisely i gather you were hurt humiliated i always thought you needed a little humiliation or was it humility either would do 

why do you walk away that isnt your style
im tired of fighting with you robert
tired
thats right
yes tired of the enterprise too the great captain picard of starfleet falls to earth ready to plunge into the water with louis that isnt the brother that i remember still i suppose it must have seemed like the ideal situation hmm local boy makes good returns home after twenty years to a heros welcome
im not a hero
of course you are admit it youd never settle for less than that and you never will
thats not true
cancel the parade in your favour
no i never sought that rubbish
never sought never sought president of the school valedictorian athletic hero with your arms raised in victory
valedictorian arms raised in victory were you so jealous
yes damn it i was always so jealous i had a right to be
right
i was always your brother watching you receive the cheers watching you break every rule our father made and get away with it
why didnt you break a few rules
because i was the elder brother the responsible one it was my job to look after you
look after me you you were a bully
sometimes maybe sometimes i even enjoyed bullying you
all right try it now
did you come back jeanluc did you come back because you wanted me to look after you again
damn you

you were asking for it you know
yes but you needed it you have been terribly hard on yourself
you dont know robert you dont know they took everything i was they used me to kill and to destroy and i couldnt stop them i should have been able to stop them i tried i tried so hard but i wasnt strong enough i wasnt good enough i should have been able to stop them i should i should
so my brother is a human being after all this is going to be with you a long time jeanluc a long time you have to learn to live with it you have a simple choice now live with it below the sea with louis or above the clouds with the enterprise
you know i think you were right after all i think i did come back so that you could help me
you know what i still dont like you jeanluc


what in the world what happened here
ah
its entirely my fault marie
yes i fell down then he fell and then
we both fell down
we both fell down
together
we both fell down together
have you two been fighting
fighting no certainly not
shame on you both what would your father say if he saw you like this
hed probably send us both to bed without our supper
well perhaps its just as well you got it out of your systems
perhaps it was marie perhaps it was ill contact louis and cancel the meeting with the board of governors its time that i was going
already jeanluc
the ship will be ready to leave orbit soon and i belong on board if i should ever doubt that again i know where to come

computer load programme crusher one
programme complete enter when ready


run programme
hello wesley as i make this recording you are about ten weeks old i wanted you to know who i am today you see this jack crusher wont exist by the time youre grown up ill be older more experienced and hopefully a little wiser but this person will be gone and i want you to know who your father was when you came into the world when i see you lying there in your crib i realise i dont know the first thing about being a father so let me just apologise for all the mistakes im about to make as you grow up i hope you dont grow up resenting the fact that i was gone so much that comes with this uniform i dont know if i can explain why starfleet means so much to me maybe youll understand when you get this recording maybe youll even want to try one of these on but youll probably be a doctor like your mother youre only a baby but its remarkable i can see in your face all the people ive loved in my lifetime your mother my father and mother our family i can see me in you too and i can feel that youre my son i dont know how to describe it but theres this connection this bond ill always be a part of you wesley well i hope this made some sense to you im not sure that it does to me but maybe ill do better next time i love you wesley
goodbye dad


come back and see us again goodbye jeanluc and be careful
take care uncle
you too someday ill be leaving for my starship too
well theres plenty of time for that you may decide to do something else as you get older
jeanluc here is a little of the forty seven do not drink it all at once and if possible try not to drink it alone


is there anything you want us to send you from home
no perhaps some of your rokeg blood pie
its been a while but i think i still remember how

captain welcome back
thank you lieutenant
these are my parents helena and sergey rozhenko

delighted sir
quite a ship you have here captain
you had the full tour i trust
well actually there are still a few areas because of the repairs
sergey its time to go
yes yes okay i have all the specs and diagrams at home



hes still out there dreaming about starships and adventures its getting late
yes but let him dream

remember me

chief medical officers log stardate  we are docking at starbase one three three for scheduled crew rotation i look forward to welcoming aboard my mentor and dear friend doctor dalen quaice who will be travelling with us to his home planet kenda two


dalen
its good to see you again beverly
you look wonderful
a lie i can live with its kind of your captain to ferry me home
its on our way thanks obrien
my pleasure doctor

dalen im sorry to hear about patricia
shed been ill for some time
is her death the reason youre giving up your post here
we had a lifetime together doing all the things wed ever dreamed and more but when she was gone i couldnt continue to work in that office sleep in that bed w
legacy


one
are you trying to fill another inside straight worf dont say i didnt warn you
pah
i fold
i will raise you three
no cards the best poker face ive ever seen dealer takes two your three and ten more
i will see your ten and raise you twenty
data have you got a flush or a full house
it will cost you twenty to make that determination sir
dealer folds
you two have successfully divided the evening between you
i suspect conspiracy far be it for me to accuse my superior officers
youre getting harder and harder to bluff data youve learned this game very well
yes sir i believe i have
tell you what ill bet that i can find any card that you hide in this deck and furthermore i will make you help me find it
careful data
your guidance is much valued counsellor however
pick a card dont let me see it  now lose it in the deck cut the deck into two even piles

okay once more time and again how many cards
eleven
take five throw them away

pick three more okay now pick one of those is that your card

incredible
not at all counsellor you surreptitiously placed the edge of your left thumb against the card when you divided the deck to reshuffle you kept that card on top you thus were able to have me either save or discard depending on the location of the card which you followed at each step until we were left with just one the card i originally chose sir i believe under the circumstances

picard to riker
captain
weve received a distress call were changing course to intercept
captains log stardate  the enterprise has bypassed its scheduled archaeological survey of camus two in response to a distress call from the federation freighter arcos which has assumed an emergency orbit around turkana four birthplace of our late comrade tasha yar

we will be entering the turkana system in eleven minutes captain
engine status
stable but we have maintained warp factor nine for longer than is recommended sir
subspace message from the arcos their transmitter is failing sir audio only
lets hear it
enterprise this is tan tsu arcos engineer estimate five minutes till warp drive containment breach make that three minutes thanks for trying enterprise
ensign warp nine point three how much time
seven minutes and fifteen seconds will bring us within transporter range captain
nine point six

 mister obrien prepare to lock onto the two crewmen
aye captain

we are now entering the turkana system sir
slow to impulse
visual contact
get them out of there obrien

status obrien
theres nothing to lock onto commander
i am reading an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escape pod
unable to establish contact
it could have been damaged by the explosion they may have been able to maintain orbit
lets hope they stay clear of the colony
that is exactly where the ion trail is leading commander
hail the colony
ive been trying to captain no response
they havent been able to maintain reliable communications since their government fell apart
the last federation vessel to make contact was the potemkin six years ago they were warned that anyone transporting down to the colony would be killed
number one ready an away team
captains log supplemental we are in orbit above turkana four an earth colony that severed relations with the federation nearly fifteen years ago i am concerned about sending an away team but if we are to discover the fate of the two missing federation crewmen i see no alternative

the surface settlement appears to be all but destroyed sensors show that the colonists now live in structures that extend nearly three kilometres beneath the city
have you located the escape pods landing point chief
yes sir three hundred metres beyond the colony perimeter
sir we can anticipate a violent response to our presence perhaps the doctor should wait here until we signal
i appreciate your concern i think its exaggerated
the colony is completely lawless lieutenant yar spoke of rape gangs and
mister worf i can handle myself
shes coming the arcos crewmen may require immediate medical assistance phasers on maximum stun energise


the dispersion trail continues in this direction the concentration gradient definitely increases along this vector the escape pod was apparently moved into the tunnels ahead of us

hardly the response we expected
pardon me
maybe things have changed here

freeze identify yourselves
were from the federation starship enterprise we tracked two of our crewmen to this area do you know anything about them
possibly
what do you mean

they found us
proximity detectors ive seen them used on manu three
follow me



the alliance is holding your men hostage commander riker not us you can expect a ransom demand
the alliance
our good friends our good friends are going to be upset when they realise we took their last crate of telluridan synthale
maybe i should take this to the authorities
we are the authorities the coalition our cadre runs this side of the city the alliance controls the other side take your choice
are you offering to help us
in return for some consideration phasers are in short supply down here a starship isnt going to miss a few
that is no better than a ransom demand
no matter what you give the alliance theyll eventually kill your crewmen anyway with our help at least theres a chance youll get your men back alive all im asking for is help in maintaining our defence we are trying to keep the peace
everything weve seen would indicate otherwise
a prank the proximity implants prevent either side from doing any serious damage they warn us when an enemy is approaching
then why do you need more phasers
the alliance just discovered a large cache of weapons im just trying to make things even to preserve the peace
you keep using the word peace weve heard a different version of life on turkana four
ancient history where did you hear that
a former crewman was born here
wheres he now
she was killed in the line of duty
thats as good a way to die as any as i said ancient history this is now and your men are in trouble
well return to the enterprise and consider your proposal
a gift for your captain

riker to enterprise energise

i want everything there is to know about the starship enterprise

according to hayne the coalition and the alliance raid each other for supplies much of it nonessential
why
a battle exercise
their defences apparently prevent deep strikes into each others territory minor skirmishes are all thats left
coalition alliance it all sounds so reasonable but what youve described is the behaviour of urban street thugs we certainly wont trade weapons for crewmen how do you suggest we deal with them
we have to tell them something
no promises no denials
for now haynes coalition is our only safe access to the colony well keep the door open see where it leads us
captain transmission coming in from turkana four on a secure channel
on screen
hello enterprise commander riker would you introduce me to your captain
im captain jeanluc picard
i have someone here you might like to meet this is ishara ishara yar
tasha was my sister
theres an old saying captain the enemy of my enemy is my friend ive decided its in my best interest to help you get your crewmen back
with nothing from us in return
you could be forced into paying my adversary a ransom in weapons ill do anything i can to avoid that possibility
what do you propose
ishara will be our liaison
i know alliance territory i can help you with a rescue plan
one moment
mute
reactions
i do not trust him
she could be a fake we told him a member of our crew was from the colony
all hayne had to do was search through their database had on starfleet to come up with tashas name
counsellor
hes deceiving us and hes clearly hoping to manipulate us as for the identity of the young woman i cant really tell
neverthe less this is an option we cannot neglect well continue on other fronts as they present themselves for now lets see what she has to say
open
i have decided to accept your proposal
thank you good luck

welcome to the enterprise ishara i am commander data
youre not human
i am an android
built for fighting
on what do you base that assumption
a cybernetic device serving on a starship
the enterprise is not a ship of war it is a ship of exploration
the first thing to do is help you map the colony this is a general grid of the tunnel system i can fill in the specific details from memory
my orders are to escort you to the observation lounge please come with me

your sister never spoke of you
thats not surprising
it is surprising to me tasha and i spent much time together we had a considerable number of conversations
did she talk at all about the colony
only to say that she was lucky to have escaped
it wasnt luck it was cowardice
cowardice is a term that i have never heard applied to tasha
is something wrong
no it is just that for a moment the expression on your face reminded me of her
its been fifteen years i dont even remember what she looked like


you dont believe im tashas sister
we have considered the possibility
im not surprised you can sample my dna if you like
yes i will
please sit down

thank you
perhaps it would help if you gave us some idea of what were dealing with on turkana four the last information describes a colony in almost complete disarray
it started falling apart almost thirty years ago there were dozens of factions they fought until the city above ground was in ruins
the coalition and the alliance are all thats left
we were the two strongest factions when the government couldnt stop the violence they gave us police powers the proximity detectors were originally designed by the government to keep us under control
apparently that part of the plan didnt work very well
no after a few months we didnt need the government any more
tasha left you in the middle of all that
she didnt abandon me if thats what you mean tasha asked me to go with her but i had already joined the coalition they were my family captain we dont have a lot of time maybe we should get started
incoming transmission from the colony captain
on screen
enterprise im being held by turkana four alliance ive been instructed to say that you have twenty hours to make reparations for federation intrusion into this colony or my pilot and i will be killed
ask them if we can at least send some medical

take that threat seriously captain theyll torture them and then theyll kill them my cadre has never recovered a hostage alive from the alliance your crewmen could be held in any number of places the alliance has two main headquarters and thirteen ancillary bases of operation all underground all heavily guarded
captain if i could get to the myographic scanner
whats that
a sensing device from the escape pod it monitors the bioelectric signatures of the crew in the event they get separated from the pod
i could install a booster on the device that would relay its signals to the enterprise then we could track the men from up here
unfortunately we dont know where the escape pod is
level three c section five four seven we have our sources


access tunnels are here and here
we could transfer the away team right into this intersection
dont underestimate them commander theyll be ready for that ive seen them use this kind of strategy before i know it looks isolated and easily accessible but my guess is they have hundreds of men on the levels above and below just waiting for you to make your move
we will need a diversion
transport a couple of photon grenades into the adjoining chamber at minimum intensity it wouldnt kill anybody but it would shake them up a bit
that wont give us enough time we need to occupy them long enough for you to install the relay
transport me into this corridor my magnetic implant will set off the defence alarms theyll think its a raid by the coalition
too dangerous weve seen what those tunnels look like you could easily be cut off from the rest of us worf if we
commander riker i was ordered to assist you in any way possible that doesnt mean as long as its safe or convenient if you had the time we could come up with another plan but you dont right now im your best option
she would have to be armed sir
id like to discuss this with the captain take ishara down to see doctor crusher

you have tashas dna on file
the ships computer does theres always some differentiation between sonomic chromosomes but not enough to affect results it should take me a few hours to run the sonomic comparison

that wasnt too bad so all thats left of my sister is a file in a computer
tasha exists in our memories as well
how did she die
lieutenant yar was killed on vagra two by a malevolent entity
in battle
no she was killed as a demonstration of the creatures power without provocation
thats not how i intend to die

the captain approves youre with us


enterprise were in position

mister obrien energise
aye captain




theyre at level two
tunnel sixteen
come on
josh youre with us
spread out


lets check five
yes sir
check on three
checking

somebodys here
watch your backs
im right behind you

this way
go go

damn
geordi what is taking so long
theres a lot of damage here the myographic scanner is operational but the power source keeps fluctuating
can you fix it
i can probably run a shunt from the convertor
how long will that take
ten minutes
do it obrien lock onto ishara and get her out of here

theres a transformer substation directly above the chamber she just entered its masking her signal

stand by stay here and cover la forge
commander
thats an order return to the ship as soon as youre finished ill signal for transport as soon as i can


get us out of here

energising


come

how is she
a couple of cracked ribs shell be all right
doctor crusher just called me with the results of the dna comparison ishara is tashas sister
after what she did for us down there that doesnt surprise me one bit
you took some unnecessary personal risks number one
we lost tasha on an away team under my command the thought of the same thing happening to her sister
thats an emotional response will we cant afford it
understood captain
commander well done

ive fused the bone tissue along both fractures the muscles around the area will be weak for a day or two but you shouldnt feel any pain
thank you doctor
ishara i wanted to thank you personally for what you did for us down on the colony it was more than i expected
i dont run away when things get tough like some people like my sister did
let me tell you about your sister the first time i saw tasha yar she was making her way through a carnelian mine field to reach a wounded colonist her ship had responded to their distress call as had mine when it was all over i requested that she be assigned to the enterprise her ships captain owed me a favour in the months that followed she never once failed to put the safety of the crew before her own and she died doing the same im sorry you never knew the woman tasha became i think you would have been proud of her and she of you


what is this structure
a main fusion source theres one next to each of the alliance headquarters it powers all of their defensive systems this chamber is accessed from the level below entry points are evenly spaced along this wall every twenty five metres data where was tashas post
tactical station where lieutenant worf is now
did tasha have many friends here
yes she was especially close to commander riker and lieutenant worf and to myself
are you able to have friends
yes
but you dont have feelings do you
not as such however even among humans friendship is sometimes less an emotional response and more a sense of familiarity
so you can become used to someone
exactly as i experience certain sensory input patterns my mental pathways become accustomed to them the inputs eventually are anticipated and even missed when absent
like my sister
yes like your sister

theyve been moved so far underground its been difficult to pinpoint their signatures but the men are here next to one of the alliance headquarters thats about two kilometres of solid granite above their heads
so much for the transporter
not necessarily we could use the ships phasers to cut a shaft through the bedrock to this storage tunnel here with a clear path through the rock wed be able to transport through the tunnel that would put us close enough to get to the crewmen but ill need two hours to refit the ships phasers for drilling
its a real maze down there
i spent a lot of time in that section before they took it over there are blind tunnels and dead ends that dont even show up on this map
we do not have much choice
if it wasnt for my implant setting off all the alarms i could guide you to your men
we could remove the implant
no it has a micro explosive inside that detonates on contact with air when you join a cadre you join for life
a small force field containing xenon or another inert gas could be placed over the incision site the explosive could possibly be disarmed at the same time it is removed
this is something youre going to have to decide for yourself ishara think about it while were waiting for geordi

our parents were killed in some crossfire just after i was born some people took care of us for a few months then one day we came home and they were gone so tasha took care of me and when i was old enough i joined the coalition
and tasha did not
my sister hated the cadres she blamed them for our parents death for everything she refused to join and she left as soon as she had the chance i always thought she was weak for doing that but maybe i was wrong maybe maybe she made the right choice to work together for something besides killing to be close to someone without having to protect your back very appealing youre the perfect example i hardly even know you data but already i completely trust you i even consider you a friend
thank you i would like to consider you my friend as well
if i had known about this place fifteen years ago things mightve been different maybe its not too late

ishara is willing to have the implant removed sir
good inform doctor crusher
she also expressed a desire to leave the colony she hopes to apply to the academy and eventually join starfleet
does she understand the magnitude of these decisions
she claims to captain
i get a sense of ambiguity from her her loyalties are clearly divided captain
are you suggesting we deny her an escape from this environment
no im just not sure she wants to escape its the only way of life shes ever known
ultimately it is her decision to make not ours mister data proceed with the mission as planned
data
yes counsellor
you seem so strong in your support im curious
we must free the crewmen she appears to be our best hope of doing so in addition i have become used to her

ishara
thank you data
you are welcome doctor crusher is expecting you in sickbay
its all so different
to what are you referring
on the colony nobody does anything for anyone else unless they have something to gain from it
but i do have something to gain from it your continued presence on this ship is something wrong
i have to tell hayne and the others i owe it to them guess i ought to get it over with
if you desire privacy you may use the observation lounge
that would probably make things a little easier


report
its working
captains log stardate  doctor crusher has successfully removed isharas magnetic implant enabling the young woman to guide our rescue attempt without my intending it she has virtually become an active member of the crew

cardiovascular functions normal metabolism immunity all other vital signs excellent how do you feel
better than ive ever felt  thanks for staying with me
you might want to keep this its been with you a long time

you keep it data so you wont forget me
have you reconsidered your decision to stay with us
no just in case something goes wrong down there

i understand you wish to join starfleet
some day if im lucky
on that day it is we who will be lucky


picard to riker is your away team ready
waiting for your signal sir

status mister la forge
phasers in alignment and ready to fire
how far must we penetrate to safely allow transporter function
one point six kilometres
fire phasers
aye sir

one point three kilometres one point four one point five kilometres one point six kilometres deep enough for transport sir
cease fire mister obrien energise


this way
caution is indicated
were near the heart of the alliance security is minimal here they arent expecting anybody this far in
ishara
follow me
are you certain
no im not im trying to remember i was here but it was a long time ago there have been changes its through here

there your men are behind that door


hold out your hands


lets get moving

where is she
commander look
what the hell happened here
she probably tried to draw their fire it triggered the alarm
worf get these men back to the enterprise
come on
data youre with me


ishara what are you doing the fusion generator is overloading you are attempting to disable the defence system for what reason we have rescued the crewmen
i dont care about your crewmen we have three thousand troops waiting at the perimeter when the defences go down theyll come in the alliance will fall
the federation will be responsible for the resulting deaths i cannot allow that
you dont have a choice
that is not so
i dont want to kill you data but i will
we will both be destroyed by the explosion
the coalitions been all ive had for fifteen years theyve given me a life i dont mind dying for them but you wont have to if you just get out of here now
was this your intention from the beginning
we never could have gotten this deep into alliance territory without your help
our help was not deliberate you deceived us
whats the difference you got what you came for why do you care about what we do
your friendship with me was part of the deception was it not you misled me at each step and yet i was completely unaware
that doesnt matter now none of it does now get out of here data please now
my duty requires me to intercede

ishara

what was she doing
disabling the detection system so her forces could attack
 set to kill


your strategy failed
it was a calculated risk you gave us an opportunity we couldnt ignore ishara are you hurt
no
i want her returned immediately
youre not in a position to dictate to anybody she attacked two federation officers
you have no jurisdiction here
dont talk about legal rights your jurisdiction is based entirely on the threat of violence
you have your crewmen back isnt that enough
what do you know about

commander data escort ishara to the transporter room
thank you captain im just trying to preserve the peace
close the channel
youre far more charitable than i would have been captain
i understand your feelings number one i share them but perhaps the fault lies in ourselves we were so eager to accept her each of us myself included wanted to see something of tasha in this woman we saw more than what was there

you havent said one word to me
what do you wish to talk about

i did what i had to do im sorry if i hurt you in the process
i am an android it is not possible for me to be injured in that fashion
whenever youre ready
you know data i wasnt always lying to you that time we spent talking that was the closest thing to friendship ive ever had if that means anything to you
energise

come in

data whats on your mind
recent events have left me puzzled sir it has been days since ishara left and yet my thoughts seem to dwell on her almost as if i were experiencing a feedback loop in my mnemonic network
i know what you mean
it is curious that i was so easily misled
make that we
yes sir
data sit down
thank you sir
in all trust there is the possibility of betrayal im not sure you were prepared for that
were you prepared sir
i dont think anybody ever is
then it is better not to trust
without trust theres no friendship no closeness none of the emotional bonds that make us what we are
and yet you put yourself at risk
every single time
perhaps i am fortunate sir to be spared the emotional consequences
perhaps

reunion

stardate  were investigating radiation anomalies reported in the gamma arigulon system by the starship lasalle preliminary readings are inconclusive

captain klingon attack cruiser decloaking bearing zero one zero mark two three seven
belay that order mister data
did starfleet mention any klingon ships in this sector
on screen
we are being hailed
all stop mister crusher
aye sir all stop
open a channel
hello captain picard
ambassador kehleyr this is an unexpected pleasure
its good to see you again captain lieutenant worf
how may we be of assistance ambassador
there is an urgent matter we must discuss captain permission to come aboard
granted

lieutenant please receive our guest
captain i must request permission to send another officer
may i know your reason
my dishonour among klingons may offend ambassador kehleyr
lieutenant you are a member of this crew and you will not go into hiding whenever a klingon ship uncloaks
i withdraw my request sir

i just received coordinates sir ready to transport two from the klingon vessel
two
yes sir
energise


i hope hell be all right alexander hasnt had much contact with other children

not even a bite on the cheek for old times sake
perhaps youre not aware of my dishonour i have accepted discommendation
ive heard so now what i have to perform some ridiculous ritual to talk to you
you may not respect our traditions but i do
sorry i just thought you might want to talk a few minutes ago you looked like someone with a question to ask
must i ask the question
yes you must

what should i tell alexander that he has no father

the klingon empire is at a critical juncture we may be facing civil war
war over what
the usual excuses tradition duty honour
the word excuses implies ulterior motives for a conflict
i wont bore you with the intricacies of klingon politics basically two factions are trying to seize power
do you believe there is a threat to the federation in this struggle
klingon wars seldom remain confined to the empire sooner or later theyll drag in the neighbouring star systems then the tholians the ferengi the federation wont be able to stay out of it for long this has been coming for some time only kmpec the head of the council has been able to maintain the peace
now something has changed that
correct kmpec is dying he is aboard the cruiser he has come specifically to meet with you captain alone


its about time you arrived picard sit

i need your help
if the enterprise medical facility can do anything to help
too late for some months i have been poisoned with small doses of veridium six the wine there is no cure
what do you want of me
after i die you will act in my name to arbitrate the struggle for power
i will
no one on the council can be trusted and i have my reasons for wanting an outsider
kmpec you cannot possibly be serious a federation officer has no business in
nonsense you are an accomplished mediator this is no different than any other dispute requiring your services
on the contrary i think this is very different and i must respectfully decline
if you refuse the dying request of the klingon supreme commander it will be a insult by the federation to all klingons besides ive already sent the order to the leaders of the two opposing factions theyre on their way
you had no right to involve me without my permission
if id asked you would have said no
this is not a case of simple mediation you are asking me to choose the next leader of the klingon empire
no by tradition the two strongest challengers fight for the right of succession as mediator only you can designate those challengers
but you have just said there are only two challengers arriving what is the point
i want you to discover which one of them has killed me gowron or duras yes duras i thought you would find that interesting
interesting you could say that since he tried to have me killed and conspired to strip worf of his good name
and i approved all for the glory of the empire that should be my epitaph find the assassin the klingon who kills without showing his face has no honour he must not lead the empire such a man would be capable of anything even war with the federation
very well i accept

captains log supplemental kmpec who ruled the klingon empire longer than anyone in history is dead we await the arrival of duras and gowron rivals for the leadership of the high council


there is no honour in attacking the weak
i would have won
no you must earn victory

where are the other klingons
there are no others on board
why
the federation and the klingon empire were enemies for many years no other klingons have asked to serve in starfleet
why
a warrior does not ask so many questions
i dont want to be a warrior


hello well youre back early
he made me leave
maybe you should go to your room and play

is he under arrest
he knows nothing of our ways
our ways you mean klingon ways dont you
he is klingon
he is also my son and i am halfhuman he will find his own ways why the sudden concern you wont even acknowledge that hes yours
why did you not tell me
what would you have done thats right you would have insisted that we take the oath just as tradition would demand
you should not have kept this from me
well now you know
i cannot acknowledge my relationship to the boy it would only harm him
because you were dishonoured
as my son he would also bear my disgrace as would his children
why did you accept discommendation from the high council
my father was accused of collaborating with the romulans at khitomer
i know and i also know that you challenged it
yes at first ultimately i withdrew my challenge
but why worf i cant believe youd just give up what really happened
lieutenant worf ambassador kehleyr report to the bridge
on our way commander

klingon vessels vorn and buruk holding stations at thirteen kilometres
open a channel mister data
channel is open sir vorn responding to hail
on screen
lets get this over with picard
in good time duras
even in death kmpec makes foolish decisions you should not be involved in this human
the sonchi ceremony will take place in one hour aboard kmpecs ship
one hour what is the delay
there is no delay it is the time i have chosen
exactly one hour picard do not be late

keep that pahtk away from the ceremony picard he has no place on a klingon ship
picard out
contact gowrons ship tell him to meet us aboard kmpecs vessel ambassador meet me in transporter room six in an hour we will begin the ceremony a little late mister worf

worf the next few days will be difficult for you
you have made it clear that i am to perform my regular duties sir
i want you to know that i am aware of your discomfort
thank you sir
ambassador kehleyr will be preparing me for my role in the rite of succession
permission to speak freely sir
granted
duras must not be allowed to lead the council
he has a legal claim mister worf your personal feelings toward him
it is not personal sir his father betrayed my people to the romulans duras is a traitor
klingon tradition may hold the son responsible for his fathers sin i cannot worf treason was his fathers crime duras crime was to lay that blame on your father i will not forget that but you should not forget that you chose to accept the consequences of that lie
to preserve the empire
the issue now is whether or not he killed kmpec
sir
he was murdered poisoned
a klingon would not use poison his murder would have no honour
kmpec believed that it was either duras or gowron
well i know little of gowron only that he is an outsider who has often challenged the council but duras i know him his heart is not klingon


thats gowron
i hope this will be brief
it will be just long enough to prove that kmpec is dead

qab jih nagil 
qab jih nagil

qab jih nagil

sonchi
now complete the rite of succession its obvious who the two challengers are
we will proceed according to the traditions and the precedents set down in klingon law
what do you know of klingon law human
we will reconvene on the enterprise wherein
no finish it here now


i have not received your report on the explosion
two klingons killed a few minor injuries were you concerned about me
as head of security it is my duty to be concerned
is that it just official concern for my well being
you know my feelings
maybe ive forgotten
you were right i would have insisted we take the oath but not just because of tradition
i thought about telling you wanted to tell you but i wasnt ready when i left you said youd never be complete without me it took some time but i came to realise i need you too youre part of me worf
jih dok
maj dok

no i cannot allow you to suffer my humiliation
there would be no suffering i dont care what other klingons think of you
but what of the boy he may want to live in the empire someday he would be an outcast another traitor from a family of traitors
family of traitors i dont believe that for a minute
respect my wishes in this matter i cannot take the oath with you nor can i claim your son
if you cannot be his father at least be his friend

we havent completed our analysis of the bomb debris doctor crusher is still studying the remains of the two men killed in the explosion we need more time
duras and gowron will be here in a few minutes i dont think you can delay this meeting again
is there some way of stretching out the formalities once they arrive
in the modern rite of succession only a brief proclamation that two challengers have been chosen is necessary
you said modern rite how was the ritual performed in the past
the old forms dictated that the challengers perform the jachuq its a long involved ceremony where the challengers list the battles theyve won the prizes theyve taken the idea being to prove their worthiness to lead the council
can the old form still be used
its up to you you can use whatever form you want
thank you
captain what do you know about worfs discommendation my interest is personal i understand that you were there you stood by him before the council id like to know what happened
im sorry i cant discuss it


the council must have a leader now complete the rite so i can kill this hadibah
you will die slowly duras
you have already proved you dont have the courage to face me perhaps you should plant another bomb

mev yap sit down we will begin the jachuq
what
this woman has been giving you bad advice picard the jachuq is obsolete
it is my choice to respect the ancient rituals each of you will have to prove your worthiness to lead the high council
that will take hours
or days depending on your cooperation


what is this
a batleth it belonged to my father it has been in our family for ten generations
let me hold it

no no no do not think of it as a weapon make it part of your hand part of your arm make it part of you


the next meeting is in three hours
i would speak with you alone ambassador
im honoured
picard is prolonging the jachuq why
he has sufficient reason to proceed carefully
he relies on you for his knowledge of klingon law
yes
then he values your advice you could quicken the pace
possibly why should i
your position is unique have you never wondered about serving the klingon empire
i serve in my own way
as a federation ambassador a few rewards but little glory
what do you want
what do you want command of a ship a seat on the council there are many opportunities for you in the empire
opportunities that will present themselves only if you come to power you talk like a ferengi
kmpec was also stubborn he too refused to listen now hes gone you need not make the same mistake
kmpec was old and weak i am not

weve completed our analysis of the bomb debris commander
the explosive was a triceron derivative
and the entire device couldnt have been more than three cubic millimetres in size
it could have been hidden anywhere in that room
theres one more thing the bomb had a moleculardecay detonator
only one race uses that device sir
the romulans

how could the romulans plant a bomb on board a klingon attack cruiser
it would be impossible
not if the romulans had help from one of the klingons
klingons and romulans working together theyve been blood enemies for seventy five years
perhaps duras or gowron wishes to improve that relationship
a new klingon alliance with the romulans
if true it would represent a fundamental shift of power in the quadrant
indeed it would put the federation in a very difficult position
duras or gowron
gowron came to me alone he wanted me to speed up the jachuq offered me a seat on the council if id help him
that doesnt suggest a romulan connection
he also implied id end up like kmpec if i didnt cooperate
captain i disagree it must be duras
why
we have had prior dealings with duras that show him to be untrustworthy
can you be more specific
no mister worf we have a conspiracy on our hands that could be a direct threat to the security of the federation
yes sir
as chief security officer you will accompany me to the next transition proceeding
captain they will be incensed my presence will be disruptive
yes it will

computer list stardates of the last enterprise mission to the klingon home planet
stardates  through 
how many ships logs during that period
forty three officers logs ten personal logs
is there a personal log for lieutenant worf
affirmative access is restricted
eliminate all personal logs list the remaining forty three in chronological order well just take them one at a time

jih doq batlh
both your claims have been properly made and recorded we are ready for the final phase of the jachuq there will be a recess while i review your petitions im sure youre as concerned as i am about the explosion aboard kmpecs vessel i assume that you are both continuing your investigations
the investigations are complete they revealed nothing of any importance
now thats very surprising our analysis turned up some startling results  will you join us lieutenant

what is this
he has no place here picard
i will not sit at the same table with that
it is my prerogative to investigate anything that may be relevant to the rite of succession lieutenant worf is my chief security officer his presence is required
we will not proceed
if you wish to withdraw from the jachuq that is your option proceed mister worf
what did your investigations reveal about the explosion
it was a bomb
and was your analysis just as insightful
it was a common explosive
what type
triceron
what about the detonator
this is pointless the findings were inconclusive
fortunately our investigation was more thorough the bomb used a moleculardecay detonator
what
a romulan device
i will return to my ship to confirm these conclusions myself
as will i
mister worf please be sure to send a complete record of our findings to both vessels and to the high council
aye sir
that will be all

look
what is this
priority message to you from the home planet it seems ambassador kehleyr is looking into things she should not be
distract the guard for me
yes sir

sir excuse me sir you cannot leave your quarters without an escort


come
i have been informed of your attempt to access restricted council records
ive been investigating what happened at khitomer not at all an easy task considering that most of the records are sealed
worfs father was a traitor
no the evidence was altered to make it appear that way i found it interesting to read that your father was also at khitomer and you are the one who sealed the records
you would dare to insult my fathers name
dont play the wounded klingon for me duras you dont do it very well what happened in that council chamber how did you get worf to take the blame for you
do not pursue this matter further
the son betrays his people to the romulans just as his father did duras

one of the klingons who died in the explosion was with duras the other was with gowron ive been examining the bodies trying to get a clue to where the bomb was hidden theres always a pattern in the lacerations and tissue damage it would normally give a clear indication as to the direction distance force of impact
normally
in this case the pattern was virtually impossible to detect i couldnt understand it until i looked at the dynoscans this wound is different from all of the others it was made from the inside out the bomb was implanted in one of their forearms
its considered an honourable way for a klingon to die a suicide that takes an enemy with it which one of them was it
duras man

future imperfect

captains log stardate  the enterprise is conducting a security survey of the onias sector near the neutral zone despite our proximity to romulan territory the mission has been quiet and uneventful


all right commander youve got till your next birthday to get that right
some things improve with age maybe your trombone playing will be one of them
its candle time birthday boy

so what did you wish for will
music lessons

mister data we must hurry or well miss commander rikers party
sir i find it interesting how much importance humans place on celebrating the day of their birth a day they cannot possibly remember
captain i am detecting some unusual fluctuations in subspace frequencies
youd better take a look at it mister data
it appears we are being probed sir
source
the third planet of the alpha onias system our reports list it as presently uninhabited perhaps reports were incorrect sir
maybe the rumours of a secret romulan base in this sector are true picard to commander riker

i apologise for interrupting your celebration but im going to need an away team could you report to the bridge please

although alpha onias three is a class m planet our survey teams have listed it as barren and inhospitable
any life signs
no sir but we have traced residual energy readings to a cavern two kilometres beneath the surface
romulans
it is possible
i suppose youll just have to go down there and find out
geordi worf youre with me
number one happy birthday


im detecting high levels of volcanic gases sulphur dioxide methane hydrogen sulphide
toxic
were okay for now but i wouldnt want to spend my vacation here
what about energy readings
magnetic clutter is increasing i cannot make an accurate determination
same here commander im getting a lot of confusing readings here
commander riker please acknowledge
riker here

were having trouble reading you
and we are having similar difficulties reading you i am advising you and your away team

to transport up at once
thats good advice commander weve got a sudden build up of gases here especially methane
transporter room

take us up
i cant get a solid lock on you sir too much interference

im trying again

transporter room whats happening

report
im trying again sir



doctor crusher hes awake
beverly
will you remember me thats good what else do you remember captain
captain


water three celsius how do you feel
confused
thats understandable considering whats happened
what has happened what happened to sickbay to you to me
sit down captain
captain i am commander william t riker what is going on here
sit please what is the last thing that you remember clearly
alpha onias three the enterprise had been probed geordi worf and i transported down to track the source
but all you found there was toxic gas they barely had time to get the three of you out will that happened sixteen years ago
thats not possible
with an altarian virus anything is possible in fact weve been expecting this
could you be more specific
that day on onias three you were infected with a strain of altarian encephalitis a retrovirus that incorporates its dna directly into the cells of its host it can lie dormant for many years and then suddenly become active again as it did in your case ten days ago you have been in a coma delirious your fever finally broke this morning

but what happened to my memory
let me show you a scan of your brain tissue when the encephalitis became active it caused widespread synapse degradation interrupting the consolidation of your memory patterns
doctor
will this virus inevitably causes memory loss back to the moment of the original infection in your case all the way back to alpha onias three
i dont believe this is this a dream
feel my hand it is flesh and bone this is not a dream and you are in fact captain william t riker in command of the enterprise
the enterprise for how long
nine years
if i have lost my memory how do i get it back
memories are formed by association smells sounds and images from the present could possibly trigger them
like a song reminds you of an old friend
exactly in associational therapy we expose the patient to familiar surroundings this could stimulate the brains neural synapses into regenerating
then lets get started theres nothing more familiar than the enterprise maybe thatll bring back some
will i said your memory could return in many of these cases the damage is permanent

what about geordi and worf were they infected too
thankfully no geordi appears to have been immune and the klingons dont seem to be affected by the virus
speaking of klingons
thereve been quite a few changes on the enterprise in the last sixteen years

deck eight
belay that order
we should begin the associational therapy in your quarters personal recollections are always the most vivid
my life was on the main bridge always has been if anythings going to jog my memory main bridge
repeat command
i said main bridge
computers been slow all morning a processing accelerators down commander la forge has running a level one diagnostic to isolate the problem

geordi

oh its good to see you up and about again sir
your eyes what happened to your visor
my visor im sorry sir doctor crusher told us that you might not remember i havent need a visor since i got these cloned implants captain

captain

welcome back captain we were not expecting to see you on the bridge so soon
commander data youre my first officer
do you remember sir
data i havent remembered a day for the last sixteen years
captain warbird uncloaking
on screen
shields up red alert
captain we were expecting the decius there is no cause for alarm
cancel red alert clearly i need to be briefed
captain the decius is hailing us the admiral wishes to speak to you
on screen

will
admiral picard deanna
how are you feeling
ive felt better
not surprising altarian viruses can be a nasty business
thats an understatement i cant even
well discuss this after weve transport over picard out

transporter room six
how are you holding up
i could get used to the idea of a ferengi ensign but admiral picard on a romulan warbird what is that all about
i think i should leave all the explanations to the admiral

whenever youre ready chief

captain riker its good to see you have recovered
im not exactly sure you can call it a recovery sir
then there has been some memory loss
how much
everything since alpha onias three

to lose sixteen years its almost beyond belief
i have trouble believing it myself
its overwhelming to have so much of your life missing
and it couldnt have happened at a worse time a few more days of relatively simple negotiations and the treaty will be signed
what negotiations what treaty
sorry ill start at the beginning which is four years ago a romulan battle cruiser strayed into federation space its warp coils had collapsed life support was failing
you saved them will you and the enterprise
the romulans were impressed to say the least after years of distrust and conflict they started to talk you were our key spokesman in securing the alliance with the romulans
how far have these negotiations progressed
the preliminaries are over all we need do now is escort the romulan ambassador to the final session
where you will complete the negotiations and sign the treaty
captain admiral i am in no condition to negotiate with the romulans or with anyone else
will youre sound of mind and body if you are properly briefed you will still be able to fulfill your duty
with a sixteen year gap in my head
we do need you
sir im not fit to resume command
i appreciate your candour but despite your condition there is no one better equipped to deal with these romulans than you
when do we leave
as soon as the ambassador transports over from the decius we will get through this as we have many times before

i hope so
let me take you to your quarters
good idea ive had enough surprises for one day

anything familiar

hi dad

and then mister greenburg asked about the fornax disaster and i knew the enterprise saved all the colonists but i didnt know  here it is but i didnt know the exact stardate their sun went nova so of you tell me ill write it down and that way i wont forget you dont remember me do you
im sorry
i need to talk to your father jeanluc would you mind leaving us alone for a moment

why didnt you warn me
beverly hoped that meeting him like this might make an impact help you remember
well it made an impact alright
give it time
jeanluc
yes the admiral was very pleased when you chose that name he is a wonderful boy
deanna whos his mother
she died two years ago a shuttle accident im sorry will
i have no recollection of her at all what was she like
min was beautiful of course strong intelligent patient
well if she was married to me she had to be patient troi she was an excellent captains wife and a very good ships counsellor she took over after i left
i cant imagine you leaving the enterprise
admiral picard offered me a position at starfleet command it was a tremendous opportunity i couldnt refuse but whats important right now today is that you have a son who needs you spend time with him you may find part of what youve lost



pretty bad huh
ive heard better
ive been practicing but i still cant get a good tone
youre putting too much pressure on the mouthpiece relax the embouchure dont use any muscles you dont need
show me again
left hand right hand

sixteen years youd think id be able to hit that note
come on dad you always make that mistake

computer summarise service record riker william t captain begin with the fornax disaster
please restate question
service record riker william t

damn it
dad
computer lag i cant believe geordis still running his diagnostic

is that what you wanted
picard to captain riker the romulan ambassador is ready to transport over from the decius
on my way id better go
sure dad everythings going to be fine

troi tells me you met jeanluc hows my namesake holding up to all this
better than i am
we did our best to prepare him
im trying to catch up with all this ive still got a long way to go a long way
just follow my lead with the ambassador youll be fine

the decius reports the ambassador is waiting to transport
beam him aboard

admiral picard captain riker its good to see you again
ambassador tomalak welcome aboard the enterprise
thank you admiral it is an honour to be the first romulan to freely walk about a federation starship

ambassador tomalak at nelvana three he threatened to take the hull of the enterprise home as a war trophy
that was a long time ago many things have changed including tomalak

as soon as we arrive at your outpost twenty three the final negotiations should go quickly
i agree ambassador all of the difficult issues have been resolved
after much debate your captain riker is the kind of negotiator even the ferengi should avoid
but we have come to an agreement both sides are happy with largely thanks to captain riker
and we are grateful captain the new alliance will greatly benefit my people
as i hope it will benefit mine
it will captain it will

main bridge
the virus you contracted captain have you fully recovered
i assure you captain riker is quite well hes looking forward to attending the final negotiations as planned
excellent the signing of this treaty is an historic occasion you of all people deserve to be there
thank you ambassador

so this is the bridge of the enterprise and this i assume is your tactical position impressive
excuse me admiral deanna i need a moment with you commander data if you would accompany the ambassador on his tour
certainly sir
excuse us ambassador
ambassador you may find this of interest these newly refined sensors are capable of pinpointing the power emissions of a cloaked warbird even at warp

are you saying you trust tomalak
i trust the process we have built with the romulans over the past four years they have nothing to gain by betrayal
are you sure youve always said its a chess game with the romulans move counter move guile and deceit
i sense no such dishonesty in tomalak his desire for peace is sincere he wants this alliance there is no cause for concern
no cause for concern were talking about revealing the location of outpost twenty three the key to all of our defences in the neutral zone
im sorry will your information is out of date the strategic importance of outpost twenty three is minimal has been for years
doctor crusher to riker are you there captain
what is it doctor
your son has been injured hes been taken to sickbay youd better come down here right away


dad
are you alright
im fine
what happened
its broken but its going to be all right in just a minute now lets go easy on this arm for a little while okay
howd this happen
i was in the gym playing parrises squares
parrises squares
i fell off the ramp
at your age you could break your neck
im sorry i didnt mean to
continue the compression attenuator for two more minutes
yes doctor
can i talk to you for a moment
ill be right back

will how old were you when you first started playing parrises squares
alright i was probably a little younger than he is its just that for all practical purposes this is my first day as a father and he almost kills himself
he didnt almost kill himself he just broke a wrist just like a lot of other boys his age when they fall
youre right its difficult
difficult for you what about for jeanluc can you imagine how he feels youve lost sixteen years jeanluc has lost a lot more than that first his mother and now his father
good as new captain you can take him home
thanks hows the arm
its fine dad im really sorry i mean i know youve got more important things to do
there is nothing more important than this son

deck eight
halt i know how hard this is for you
its okay dad
no okays not good enough when i was your age my own father he wasnt there for me and i really needed him ive often wondered what kind of father id be i never felt quite ready the idea even scared me a little
scared you
yeah but i guess i got over it youre here resume its important to me that i dont let you down jeanluc
you never have dad youve always been there for me
ill have to take your word for that because i dont remember any of it your first step your first tooth nothing and i want to remember i guess theres only one thing we can do weve got to build some new memories

im not sure its still in the memory banks but i used to have a great fishing programme on the holodeck
the curtis creek programme
you know it
sure weve gone to curtis creek lots of times
would you like to go again
you bet
well as soon as these negotiations are out of the way you and i are going fishing
great

and then mom tried to net the fish and she fell in the creek too and then you tried to pull us both out and you fell in
im not sure i want to remember that
mom really liked curtis creek we went there for picnics and stuff lots of times
what was she like
she was great i think of her a lot id better go change
computer display family record riker william t limit to visual

display family record riker mrs william t
please restate request
damn
whats wrong dad
the computer still isnt working properly i cant get a visual of your mother
but i know moms pictures are there did you give a stardate computer display family record riker mrs william t home file stardate 

min minuet
mom was beautiful wasnt she
yes
whats wrong dad
la forge to riker
riker here
captain please come to the bridge
on my way

whats the problem
ive had to shut down the warp engines captain
why
antimatter containment fields are fluctuating its nothing to worry about though
were on the edge of the neutral zone on impulse power and youre not concerned
ill have the engines back online in no time sir
like you tracked down that faulty processing accelerator
im running a level one diagnostic
for thirty hours it would never take you more than four youre incapable of that level of incompetence mister la forge worf where did you get that scar
in combat
what battle when which sector which unit mister data if we left immediately when would we arrive at outpost twenty three
 at warp one in three days four hours
how about at warp seven  at warp eight at warp nine whats the matter data what happened to those millions of calculations per second
pardon me sir i am experiencing subspace interference which limits my abilities i cant operate as quickly as
what did you say
i said i cannot operate
no thats not what you said you said i cant you used a contraction didnt you
sir i can explain if you would just give me a moment
no you cant dont even try

captain perhaps it would be best if we discussed this
shut up
i beg your pardon
i said shut up as in close your mouth and stop talking
will i sense how upset you are youre angry and impatient
deanna back off well would anyone else like to speak up or shall we end this charade
as you wish commander riker

the charade is over


the enterprise my son you created it all
with the help of our neural scanners and what you would call a holodeck now please tell me how did you discover the truth the future we constructed for you should have been convincing
it wasnt there was a computer time lag for one thing
unavoidable our scanners have a limited response time so whenever you strayed from our expectations but surely that was not enough to
to smash your house of cards no it was the visual record of my wife minuet bad move
but we chose someone from your past who is still alive a woman you were extremely attracted to
your mistake tomalak minuet was nothing more than a computer generated fantasy i once experienced on another holodeck
impossible in your mind that woman exists physically your feelings toward her remain quite passionate
she was part of a very special programme
so much effort so little accomplished
if it was outpost twenty three you were after why didnt you use your neural scanners to probe my mind
our scanners are calibrated for romulan brain patterns when it comes to human brains they are less efficient there were gaps in the information we gathered from your memory
gaps from what i saw i find that hard to believe you recreated the enterprise the crew every nuance and smell sound with perfect accurate i didnt see any gaps i dont buy it tomalak
were wasting time bring him


when you and your colleagues transported to this planet you were less than a kilometre from this base your capture was a simple matter
my colleagues where are they
we allowed them to transport safely back to the enterprise but your signal was diverted
my people wont stop looking for me tomalak
they already have

please say hello to your son


jeanluc
that is not his name of course nor have you ever really met him we merely used his image to augment your programme
what have you done to him
while i am gone please give careful thought to your situation

whats your name

whoa if were going to get out of here youre going to have to trust me easy im not going to hurt you who are you how did you get here my name is will
ethan they brought me here with my parents we were at a research station on miridian six
miridian six on the edge of the neutral zone i thought that was uninhabited
the station was set up last year then the romulans came
its odd that the enterprise wasnt advised where are your parents now
they took them away
do you know why the romulans are keeping you here
no i just want to get away
ill get us out of here ethan
how even if we do get away theyll find us they found me when i escaped before
you escaped
yes i hid in a secret place for weeks but they caught me when i came out to find food

i want that information commander i want the location of outpost twenty three very well i have been given permission to use whatever means are necessary

ethan no
stop him


that secret hiding place of yours

this way

in here


their sensors should have picked us up
no they cant i heard them theres something in these rocks
heavy metals
right


the romulans forgot all about this storeroom when they rebuilt their tunnels here use these help me

after i got away last time i mapped out all their tunnels supply depot communications living quarters and shuttlebay
how many guards in the shuttlebay
only two or three
if we stole a shuttlecraft that would get us nowhere the romulans could follow their own ship to easily but if we broke into their communications system we could send a message to the enterprise
we cant do that the transmitter is on a voiceactivated security system
do you know whose voice activates it
only ambassador tomalak
who
tomalak
ambassador tomalak tomalak is a romulan captain the only time he was ever called ambassador was in a holodeck fantasy how do you know about that
you er you told me about him
who are you what is your part in all this

theyve found us
but you said their sensors didnt work in this tunnel
they must have fixed them weve got to go
where are we going to go ethan
the shuttlebay theres still time
ive had enough

commander surrender your weapon
no more games no more fantasies im not going to play anymore


it was never the romulans it was you all along wasnt it

there is no question about it sir it is his signal
picard to commander riker do you read me
riker to picard im here
are you all right
yes sir im all right what about

geordi and worf
we beamed them up an hour ago theyre fine

but we lost you in midtransport whereve you been what is going on down there
im not sure yet sir

but i think im about to find out stand by what shall i call you ethan jeanluc
it doesnt matter
this room its more than a holodeck isnt it
much more the neural scanners read my mind give me everything i want just like they tried to give you everything you wanted
everything i wanted you probed the enterprise you lured us here so you could play games with me i didnt want that you did why
my world was invaded my people killed my mother brought me here so our enemies would never find me
they found her didnt they
she knew that they would never stop looking for her so she made sure i would be safe

she left the scanners to protect me to give me anything i wanted
anything then why did you kidnap me
i wanted you to stay its been so long i just want somebody real i thought that youd be happy im sorry
i have to return to my ship come with me you dont have to stay here anymore you dont have to be alone anymore

my name is barash
to me youll always be jeanluc two to transport
final mission

captains log stardate  i am preparing to leave by shuttlecraft for pentarus five where i have been asked to mediate a dispute among the salenite miners a contentious group unfortunately prone to violence but first i must deal with a situation of a far more personal nature


sir
mister crusher i summoned you almost ten minutes ago
sir im sorry i was in the middle of a very important experiment i was using some very volatile compounds i couldnt just leave them lying out
excuses mister crusher
no sir i was just attempting to offer a
because i can assure you that will not go down well at starfleet academy
yes sir im aware of that the academy
i just received a message from admiral nsomeka she expects you to report in two weeks a position has opened up in this years class
thank you
now youll have to work overtime in order to catch up but i have assured the admiral that you are capable of that please dont make a liar out of me
oh no sir i wont
well for your final mission aboard the enterprise you will accompany me to pentarus five while i try to sort out the problems with the miners commander riker has told me youve been studying the effects of outpost judiciary decisions on federation law what better way to get first hand experience
captain i am picking up a general distress signal from gamelan five
on screen
please does anyone read us
open a channel i am captain jeanluc picard of the federation starship enterprise
captain i am chairman songi of gamelan four an unidentified spacecraft has entered orbit above our planet radiation levels in our atmosphere have increased by three thousand percent we can only assume we are under attack but the ship will not answer our hails we are a peaceful planet we have no ability to defend ourselves please can you help us
mister data are we close enough for a scan
no sir we are out of range
any other ships in that sector
negative commander
chairman songi we will proceed immediately to your planet
thank you captain
commander riker take the enterprise and investigate the problem ensign crusher and i will proceed to pentarus five the miners have sent a shuttle we shall leave in ten minutes
yes sir

you know ive noticed here that your manoeuvring thrusters are rigged in a configuration ive never seen before
its my own modification its more efficient you can study it if you want to


excuse me captain ive run safety and operational inspections captain everything checks out all right but i wont make any claims as to its comfort
captain picard captain dirgo of the shuttlecraft nenebek
ah captain its good to meet you
captain of a mining shuttle
yes ensign captain my ship isnt pretty she isnt big but weve logged almost ten thousand hours together
oh yes she seems a very sturdy craft
we should go captain will you take ops
ill let ensign crusher perform that task i have to study up on regalian law

shuttlecraft has cleared the bay sir
ensign allenby set a course for the gamelan system warp six
 aye aye sir

youve done this before
yes
your captain back there if he isnt tougher than he looks those miners will tear him apart
dont worry about captain picard hell handle them

ive lost navigation
the port thruster quads gone guidance couplings severed i cant stabilise her

the port thruster module blew
nenebek to enterprise emergency do you read pentarus station come in communications gone
is your navigational system functioning
negative switching to manual fifty million kilometres to pentarus five we may have to put down somewhere else
mister crusher scan for a classm environment
aye sir
im going to have to throttle back on the main impulse engines
sir one of the moons around pentarus three registers as class m barely the mean temperature is fifty five degrees celsius
life forms indicated
negative but scanning is limited theres a very strong magnetic field around the surface
we dont have a choice save the impulse engine for controlled entry
mister crusher reconfigure working thrusters to manual input
ill try sir but this grid looks about a hundred years old
we dont have the federations resources captain take the helm im rerouting the deuterium flow hull temperature seven hundred degrees
beginning braking manoeuvre
were below mach one bypass the thrusters now
brace yourself for impact


dear god lets salvage what we can the first thing well need is shelter from the sun in this heat the shuttle will act like an oven
all the systems are out cant get a communication channel location transponders gone too
well have to check the craft for something to protect our heads and eyes and captain please recover your medical supplies food and water rations
well the medical supplies are all right
food and water
the replicator damaged beyond repair
surely you have emergency supplies
this isnt a starship i have to choose what i carry
are you telling me theres no water


scanning vessel reads as an unmanned sublight freighter
origin
indeterminate propulsion appears to employ a gaseous core fission reactor but it is not functioning
the radiation levels from that ship are off the scale
could that be leakage from their engines
no sir engine reactor elements appear to have been inactive for approximately three hundred years the vessel is carrying various unstable waste products
you mean its a garbage scow
precisely
mister worf open a hailing frequency chairman songi this is commander riker on board the enterprise
yes commander
it appears youve inherited someone elses problem an old waste vessel caught by your planets gravitational pull
have your people begun to suffer from radiation sickness
not yet but some areas are already detecting dangerous levels
well do our best to get it out of here as quickly as possible
thank you commander
were going to push that barge into the gamelan sun
sir the meltasion asteroid belt lies between here and the sun
then well have to take it ourselves well use our deflectors clear a path through the asteroids
i dont like the idea of getting close enough to that barge to tow it the radiation levels are so high wed be risking the contamination of the entire crew
do you have a better idea geordi
we could send over a construction module to attach thrusters to it then we could direct it through the asteroid belt from a safe distance
commander a message from the mining settlement on pentarus five the shuttlecraft carrying captain picard has not yet arrived
they left here at oh eight hundred hours
they have asked if we are beginning a search
tell them we have an emergency situation well begin a search as soon as weve completed that
aye sir
mister la forge prepare to launch the construction module id like to get this over with as fast as possible


any luck with the tricorder ensign
i think so sir the scanning range may be a bit limited but its better than nothing
these were on board captain theyre working

excellent our communicators may not be able to get a signal through this strong a magnetic field im fashioning an arrow if a search party finds the wreckage theyll know weve headed for those mountains

are you crazy theyre too far away well never make it
we cant survive in this sun where theres mountains theres shelter
youve got no right to make the decisions im the captain of this ship
if you want to get out of this i suggest you listen to captain picard hes the one whos going to keep us alive
thank you ensign thats enough captain dirgo youre an able pilot i welcome your input do you feel that there is an alternative were overlooking
no
very well i suggest a steady pace not a brisk one we need to ration our energy try breathing through your nose that way it will help to prevent dehydration ill lead captain dirgo will you bring up the rear


and you were worried about how tough the captain is


did you find water
no not yet
what are you doing with that
mister crusher
im not sure sir its an energy reading
energy reading what kind
low frequency em its been getting stronger the closer we get to those mountains
what are you saying is something over there waiting for us
im not sure what it is it just keeps registers as a repeating energy pattern
ensign are you suggesting this energy is not naturally occurring
the readings could be indicative of some electromagnetic properties in the rocks but i dont think so
a life form
its possible the pattern is fairly organised
well we cant go back and we cant stay here weve got to keep going for the mountains no matter what is waiting there


there has to be water in here arent caves formed by water
not necessarily this could be created by volcanic activity lava flows these walls are dry mister crusher do you have any moisture reading
no sir but that em reading the patterns changed the frequencys peaking a lot higher

you have water
i wouldnt hide water thats called dresci its from my planet
its alcohol
its medicinal its for emergencies i was going to share it with you
this wouldnt quench your thirst it would make it worse
ill take my chances
im not going to let you waste this this is more valuable to us as a coolant or disinfectant
its mine
mister crusher stow that with the medical supplies keep your eye on it all right were going to explore the cave mister crusher look for any signs of water no matter how faint captain dirgo will you lead the way

were projecting that the bulk of the radiation will affect three small island groups fortunately theyre very sparsely populated well begin replicating hyronalin now and be ready to transport it to them if it becomes necessary please coordinate with all the medical personnel on the planet
beverly weve contacted the nearest starbase for a search vessel im afraid the closest one is almost a week away
i see thank you
but we have asked the mining settlement to send any vessels they might have you know there are many reasons why the shuttlecraft may have been delayed
deanna thank you but im all right and for now i have work to do

commander the miners report that they have very few operable shuttlecraft they want to know when we will be joining the search
tell them to stand by if this works well be on our way
aye sir
thrusters are attached and ready commander
initiate prefire sequence
prefire command transmitted thrusters to standby
fire thrusters gradual acceleration to forty percent power

weve lost one module correcting thrust vectors to compensate
structural integrity of the barge has been compromised disintegration is continuing
shut down thrusters ensign take us to one thousand metres ahead of the barge and hold
external radiation levels increasing sir
coming into position at one thousand metres
worf extend shields around the ship lock on the tractor beam
aye sir
warning radiation levels at seventy millirads per minute and rising
allenby set a new course well take it through the asteroid belt ourselves one quarter impulse
aye sir
doctor crusher to the bridge
on my way
mister data ill a projection of the radiations impact on the crew mister worf contact the mining settlement tell them we wont be joining the search for awhile


i knew there had to be water

mister crusher what was that
it seems to be some kind of tightly confined annular force field sir
put there to protect the water
yes there has to be a way to deactivate it sir
we can with our phasers
mister dirgo i think it would be wiser

captain the em reading the power levels really spiking now
i think its working
dirgo

stop firing

wesley



apply pressure to that wound  this is the worst break
what was that thing
keep the pressure constant
ensign how bad is it
your right leg is broken you have a fracture in your left arm and you took a blow to the head but were getting the bleeding under control
well done im going to be fine i just need to get my breath
are you telling the truth
what truth
hes bleeding inside ive seen it before hes never going to survive
you dont know what youre talking about

youre wasting your time will you save that dresci for us
mister dirgo i would appreciate it if you didnt bury me before im gone

the trouble is he could be right
no hes not sir youre going to be fine
wesley you are going to have to keep a rein on dirgo hes wilful and stubborn thats dangerous
youll handle him sir
wesley listen to me i have no feeling in my right leg my vision is blurred im going to get worse not better im not going to be able to help you now you are going to have to stand up to dirgo on your own
yes sir
hey good man
first officers log stardate  radiation levels on the enterprise continue to rise the ventilation system has started pumping hyronalin into our air supply to counteract the effects

at the rate the radiation levels are increasing the hyronalin additive will only be effective for another thirty eight minutes
crusher to medical unit one evacuate and seal off all nonoperational areas group the crew and their families in the interior corridors of decks nine and ten radiation exposure protocol
acknowledged doctor
mister data at our current speed how long will it take us to get through the asteroid belt
fifty one minutes fourteen seconds sir
theres going to be a lot of casualties if we cant get there any faster
mister la forge how much more can we get out of that tractor beam
were already at the maximum limits of our towing speed commander
lets see if we can establish a new upper limit
yes sir data monitor the shearing effect on the beam increasing to one half impulse
tractor beam is holding shearing force eighty metric tons per metre
increasing to three quarters impulse
shearing force ninety two metric tons ninety three tractor beam is destabilising se are going to lose the barge commander
reduce power
one half impulse
geordi youve got to stabilise that tractor beam
i cant divert any more power to the shields were already hitting our maximum thermal limits only other choice is to bring some other fusion reactors online but were running at peak coolant pressure
do it
warning radiation levels at one hundred fifty millirads per minute and rising lethal exposure in thirty five minutes


how did this happen
that thing did it
these are selenium fibres electrically deposited the em pattern is back down it only peaks when we move towards the water whatever we saw must act like a sentry to try to guard the fountain when were not moving toward the water the wave pattern stays low right between five and fifteen megahertz dirgo move toward the fountain dirgo

there it just went to forty
what is this getting us weve got to get to the water
if i can figure out how to manipulate the frequency maybe i can control it the sentry first appeared when you used your phaser that means it could respond to heat or collinated energy
if youre right we can use a phaser to lure it away
hold on we need to know what were dealing with before we start doing anything
enough talking its time to do something ill start firing when it comes you fire and draw it away
dirgo i cant
put your phaser on automatic leave it on that ledge and take cover
and what makes you think its going to go for my phaser and not for yours
because ill be firing on the lowest setting you use maximum
there is no evidence that it responds differently to higher settings we have to figure out our options before we just
while we are doing that your captain is dying with those wounds most men would already be dead if he doesnt get water when i start firing you better do your part

first officers log supplemental mister la forge has diverted power from auxiliary fusion generators in an attempt to stabilise the tractor beam this is the only hope of increasing our towing speed so we can clear the asteroid belt before radiation levels become fatal

warning radiation levels at three hundred millirads per minute and rising lethal exposure in one minute
ready commander ill be rotating the output of the auxiliary reactors but it should still give us the power we need
proceed mister la forge
increasing to three quarters impulse
shearing force is at one hundred three metric tons tractor beam is stable
full impulse
tractor beam is holding
warning lethal radiation exposure in thirty seconds
we are within visual range of the asteroid belt
on screen
warning lethal radiation exposure in fifteen seconds
prepare to cut the barge loose
warning lethal radiation exposure in ten seconds
we have cleared the asteroids sir
let it go

cold
when the sun went down the temperature really dropped this should help

good thank you im not much good to you wesley
sir dirgo is dead i shouldve tried harder to stop him but he captain captain picard sir stay with me
im trying
sir do you remember when we took the shuttlecraft to starbase five one five i was dreading it six hours alone with you but it didnt turn out the way that i thought you opened up to me i kind of got to know you
wesley its my fault that youre here i shouldnt have asked you
sir im honoured you wanted me along
i was selfish i thought i wouldnt see you again im sorry
sir in the past three years ive lived more than most people do in a lifetime i think im very lucky no matter what happens how many people get to serve with jeanluc picard sir you dont know this no one knows this because i never told anyone all of the things ive worked for school my science projects getting into the academy ive done it all because i want you to be proud of me if there is one thing that ive learned from you its that you dont quit and im not going to quit now ive seen you think yourself out of worse problems than this and im going to think us out of this youre not going to die im not going to let you die ill get to the water and ill keep you alive until they find us i promise
first officers log supplemental the enterprise is returning to the last known location of the missing shuttlecraft

are you certain
it is definitely debris the primary material is duranium with smaller proportions of sonodanite and ermanium
most shuttlecraft hulls are made of duranium
then theyre gone
not necessarily doctor there is far too little debris to account for an entire shuttlecraft
so what is it
you know dirgo had his manoeuvring thrusters rigged a funny way claimed it was more efficient if one of them blew it might have left debris like that
if only one of his thrusters was out he could still have set down somewhere
the only class m planets in the system are pentarus two and five both of which have been thoroughly searched by the miners
then well search them again
sir there are also four moons in the pentarus system that could support life
have the miners searched them
not yet sir
which one is the closest one to the debris coordinates
lambda paz one of the moons of pentarus three
set a course ensign

aupres de ma blonde il fait bon fait bon fait bon ensign where are we
we crashed sir were in a cave
i need water
sir we dont have any water dont you remember we tried to get to the fountain and captain dirgo
yes i remember
i think im on to something ive analysed the sentrys energy patterns
wesley i may not make it
ive taken the transponder element from my communicator and ive used it to modify my tricorder
no listen
i think i can use it to interrupt the sentrys electrical pattern stop it maybe slow it down
listen to me
yes sir
theres so much i wanted to tell you the academy theres someone someone who meant a great deal to me hes been there forever someone you must get to know his name is boothby now you tell him that you and i were friends now when i was there he helped me listen to him
what does he teach
hes the groundskeeper one of the wisest men i ever knew oh i envy you wesley crusher youre just at the beginning of the adventure go on get the water stay alive theyll find you
ill be back soon
of course wesley you remember i was always proud of you


it worked


captain captain picard wake up

captain

wesley wesley wesley
mom
yes
oh mom

wesley thank god
i am so happy to see you
youre okay come on
how did you find us
we found the wreckage and the arrow which indicated your direction well take wesley by stretcher as well
no i can walk
doctor
were taking you back to the enterprise weve stabilised your vital signs all right lets go now
one moment mister crusher
yes sir
what are you doing in such a filthy uniform
you dont look so shipshape yourself sir
wesley you will be missed
the loss


its been five months since marcs accident i havent missed a single hour of my duties i volunteered for extra time in the nursery my language studies are better than theyve ever been somebody else might have given in but i didnt
given in to what
death is a normal part of life maybe some of us are better at facing that than others
maybe some of us arent facing it at all
what do you mean
recovery from a great loss involves a great deal of pain if we try to avoid that pain we can make it harder on ourselves in the long run
but i feel fine
today would have been your husbands thirty eighth birthday
you keep excellent records deanna last night i dreamt marc was with me celebrating i was so glad that this nonsense was finally over then i woke up alone and i knew that he was dead for the first time i knew it i looked around for anything that belonged to him anything i forgot that after the funeral i told them to take it all away what in the world was i thinking

they didnt take everything away

how did you know 

an ancient trail along the kabul river in the himalayas its a wonderful programme will it would do you good to have a little fresh holodeck air
i think my horsemanship is a little rusty for the himalayas thanks anyway
nonsense we programme an appropriately docile steed
captain sensors indicate a vast field of
of what lieutenant
its gone but something did appear directly in our path
 deflector shields are not encountering elevated levels of interstellar matter
a sensor echo data
uncertain i have no unusual readings commander


i promise ill come by to see you tomorrow deanna are you alright
what what
you faded out there for a second
oh no no im fine im just very tired thats all will i see you tomorrow
tomorrow thank you deanna


an aggregate field of planepolarised objects has just appeared and disappeared
recommend we run a diagnostic on the forward sensor array we dont want a ghost tailing us all the way to tlli beta
im not convinced it is a ghost there may be something there commander
ensign allenby full stop
aye sir
lets investigate both possibilities

captains log stardate  sensor diagnostics have been completed and indicate that all systems are normal there remains no explanation for the images which appeared in our path

i have completed another full scan of the area sir there is no further indication of the anomaly
ensign prepare to resume course to tlli beta mister data what velocity would put us back on schedule
a resumption of our present course at warp six will place us in the tlli beta system in six days thirteen hours forty seven minutes
what no seconds
i have discovered sir a certain level of impatience when i calculate a lengthy time interval to the nearest second however if you wish
no no minutes is fine
stand ready at warp six ensign
aye sir
engage

riker to engineering geordi what the hell happened

checking looks like the field collapsed before we could enter warp

recommend full stop while i check it out
back to full stop ensign
aye sir
all decks reporting minor injuries only
damage
none sir
weapons and shields normal
go to yellow alert
captain weve started moving again something is pulling us


troi to doctor crusher

yes deanna
beverly

im feeling very dizzy
did you hit your head
im not sure im not sure what happened

lie down breathe deeply and stay calm im getting calls from all over the ship ill be there as quickly as i can

new heading confirmed zero two five mark two seven three speed is holding at one tenth impulse
whatevers pulling us sure isnt in a hurry
picard to la forge
go ahead captain
if your engines are functioning well attempt to break free

everything down here seems normal enough sir but i suggest we take it a bit slower this time

ensign bring us around ninety degrees to starboard
new course laid in at ninety degrees to starboard
one quarter impulse engage
aye sir nothing captain speed and course are unaffected
one half impulse
no change
full impulse rotate heading in five degree increments
aye sir

la forge

theres nothing wrong down here the engines are fine

integrity field stress exceeding eighty two million kilodynes recommend immediate shutdown sir
make it so ensign
all engines down were still being pulled same heading same speed

i got here as quickly as i could ive got a sickbay filled with headaches how are you
well when i first called you i was feeling intense pain now its gone but im feeling a bit foggy
id like to take you to sickbay and run an inner nuncial series can you walk
all senior staff report to the observation lounge
are you up to that
i think so

what is it
nothing nothing im fine

could it be some sort of tractor beam
no other ship is indicated
mister worf what is your analysis
tactical sensor readings are indeterminant
they dont even give us enough for an educated guess
and yet all sensors are operating properly
can there be an intelligence at work here counsellor do you sense a lifeform out there
no i dont think so no theres nothing nothing i sense nothing
its alright counsellor perhaps theres nothing out there to sense
indeed there are many races that are not empathically detectable the breen the ferengi the
no you dont understand i dont sense anything not out there not in here all of you youre all blank to me

no indication of a concussion or a blow to the head just a pattern of unresponsive neural cells throughout the cerebellum and cerebral cortex
unresponsive
theres brain damage how serious i cant tell yet
but i feel perfectly fine otherwise
can you treat it
im not sure i have to review the database on betazoid neurophysiology
the betazoid brain has a remarkable ability to heal itself this condition could just reverse itself time
it might but you are half human that changes the map a little i dont want to offer you any false hopes
its just hope beverly not false hope
what would cause something like this because it started at the same time we encountered the anomaly
there may be a connection i dont know if you were anyone else you know the first thing id do id send you to counsellor troi
well then i have an advantage dont i i see her quite often
deanna its no different than one of us suddenly going blind
you dont have to tell me beverly i understand the psychology
you may understand it but youve never had to live with it
i may be perfectly fine by tomorrow
and you may not now ill do my homework ill see what i can do to regenerate those cells in the meantime i want you to talk to someone there are several people on board who have degrees in psychology who are qualified therapists
okay fine if i need to right now i just want to go back to work
deanna
if there are no medical objections
no medical objections
thank you beverly will

come in
i dont have a psychology degree but if youd like to talk
you know what the worst part of this is and ive seen it happen to so many patients
what
the way other people change how they start to treat you differently they walk on eggshells around you sometimes they avoid you altogether sometimes they become overbearing reach out a helping hand to the blind woman
im sorry if i
i will not be treated that way
hey imzadi
oh please
deanna ive never seen you quite so scared
im fine if i get better i get better if i dont ill adapt life goes on
deanna
i really have to finish this i have some appointments this afternoon

probe launch successful telemetry transmissions are being received
okay lets see what weve got nothing unusual here the same reading as the ship sensors
expanding analysis parameters including bayesian functions broad em and subspace spectrum polling
no change
i am adding virtual particle trajectories

whoa what is that
unknown i am attempting to analyse motion pattern results still inconclusive
last time i saw anything that looked like that i was skindiving off the coral reefs at bracas five

you said you woke up a new woman this morning
thats how i feel
tell me about her this new woman
shes not holding anything back any more
shes not
i let it all out last night i cried for two hours i realised that i had never accepted the loss of my husband i worked hard i kept busy i did everything to pretend it never happened
and you feel different now
completely
can i share something important with you
of course
ive temporarily lost my empathic sense its kind of like having one hand tied behind your back
im so sorry do you want me to come back
no no im fine its just i feel before we continue its important you know that okay
all right
because i cant tell how youre feeling this morning but it seems to me that one night of crying cant make up for months of denial
no youre wrong i feel better today than i have in ages youre absolutely wrong deanna

the probes point of view reveals that the objects exist entirely in two dimensions on a single plane
they have length and width but not height virtually flat
that is why the ships forward sensors did not detect them initially we were looking at them along their edge there was no surface to read i will illustrate

are they a lifeform
the movement pattern within the cluster is not a naturally occurring phenomenon in the newtonian sense they appear to be alive
can you explain why theyre pulling us along with them
somehow theyre able to polarise the graviton field as they move about were caught in the wake
how do we get out of it
best idea for now is to try a controlled overload of the warp drive jump directly to warp six the laws of a threedimensional universe say it should work dont know about a twodimensional universe though
fascinating so many questions how can a twodimensional entity have access to a threedimensional universe and are they aware of us number one if we can put off the tlli betans i would like to investigate this further as soon as were free of the graviton field
its a shame we cant tell if theyre sentient
what do you mean by that im doing the best that i can
no one suggested otherwise counsellor mister data try to isolate any signal patterns from the cluster perhaps therell be a basis for communication mister la forge well attempt your warp jump as soon as youre prepared thatll be all counsellor


how are you feeling
beverly i cant do my job im absolutely lost you have to do something
i crossreferenced your scan results with the baseline files in the computer nothing helpful has turned up and so far the lab work is inconclusive
inconclusive what does that mean
it means there is nothing i can do now i am still trying
how do you people live like this
we get by pretty well actually and so will you in time
you have no idea no idea what this is like how can you know what its like to lose something you never had
i dont claim to
and yet youre telling me im supposed to get used to it
if our positions were reversed what would you tell me
if our positions were reversed i wouldnt have been in here treating skinned elbows while you were lying passed out on your office floor id have been there a lot sooner perhaps in time to prevent this from ever happening


ive been working with ensign brooks since the death of her husband shes avoided the reality of what happened denied it to herself and i realise ive been doing the same thing about my condition
thats perfectly understandable
its time i accept the truth captain and resign as ships counsellor
resign
i can no longer fulfill my obligations what other option is there
deanna ive been fortunate to have access to your betazoid abilities most starship captains have to be content with a human counsellor empathic awareness is not a requirement of your position
it is for me
im sure that after a while youll be able to adjust they say when one loses a sense the other senses become stronger to compensate a blind man develops better hearing
with all due respect captain you dont know what youre talking about that is a common belief with no scientific basis no doubt created by normal people who felt uncomfortable around the disabled i am disabled and im telling you i cannot perform my duties
there was a teacher of mine at the academy who had been confined to a wheelchair since birth she was a woman
captain spare me the inspirational anecdote and just accept my resignation

come in

i really would rather be alone right now
too bad

is this how you handle all of your personnel problems
sure youd be surprised how far a hug goes with geordi or worf
will i dont know what to do
so you resign you walk away from all the people who care about you
i look around me and all i see are surfaces without depth colourless hollow nothing seems real
im real
no youre not youre a projection with no more substance to me than a character on the holodeck
i dont believe that
you have no idea how frightening it is to just be here without sensing you without sharing your feelings
thats it isnt it were on equal footing now
what
you always had an advantage a little bit of control of every situation that must have been a very safe position to be in to be honest id always thought there was something a little too aristocratic about your betazoid heritage as if your human side wasnt quite good enough for you
that isnt true
isnt it
la forge to riker
go ahead geordi

we are ready to attempt a controlled overload jump to warp six

acknowledged im on my way to the bridge ill check in on you later
really you dont have to
i will check in on you later

setting a new course at optimal shearing angle bearing two one seven mark two zero three
engaging impulse

engines now

mister la forge go to warp
aye sir
status
unchanged we have not broken free of the graviton field
integrityfield pressure has increased by two hundred seventeen percent captain
warning differential stress will exceed upper limit in fifteen seconds
disengage all engines

warning differential stress will exceed upper
engines disengaged sir

report la forge
the energy we wanted to transfer to the nacelles

was absorbed by the graviton wake instead it set up a torsional wave that rebounded back to the ship

were lucky the hull is still in one piece
this little nuisance is beginning to lose its fascination
sir during our attempt to break away i recorded a momentary alteration of the movement pattern within the cluster
you think we got their attention data
perhaps but just for an instant the pattern immediately returned to its previous dynamic
follow up on it mister data input your observations into the universal translator
aye sir
perhaps the movements themselves are an attempt at communication

 more tea i didnt mean to startle you
thats alright im getting used to it
may i
sure

are you really getting used to it
no
do you want to talk about it
no
good i get so tired of people coming in with their problems they come in they want a shoulder to cry on and generally it turns out to be mine
youd make a good counsellor
i think so too so im going to talk to picard about it
about what you becoming counsellor
well yes youre leaving that means there wont be a counsellor on board and i suppose im going to have a very long line at that bar it would be nice to have a nice office too
its more than just letting them cry on your shoulder it takes an enormous commitment
i can do that
guinan people come to you to talk about things they want to reveal as ships counsellor you have to get them to talk about things they dont want to reveal
i could do that too
what are you you dont really want to be ships counsellor
what would make you say that
i just know youre not serious
have i given you any indication that i might not serious
not really but
then how do you know are your empathic abilities coming back
no i suppose its just instinctive i get it youre trying to make me see that i have other abilities to draw on human intuition instincts guinan those skills only develop after years of experience its not that easy
no one said it was easy its much harder than you think human intuition and instinct are not always right but they do make life interesting
so im discovering

problem data
yes commander sensors are detecting highly accelerated interstellar gases
suggesting
uncertain sir the phenomenon is within visual range
on screen  magnify
it appears to be a cosmic string fragment only one hundred seven kilometres long
a cosmic string
no wider than a proton but with gravitational fields as powerful as a black hole
the twodimensional beings seem to be caught in the gravitational pull of the string their course is taking them directly toward it
and us right along with them
captains log stardate  what began as a curious inconvenience has turned into a serious threat at current speed the twodimensional beings and the enterprise will be drawn into the cosmic string fragment in seven hours

the entities offer no indication that they are aware of the string fragment captain their course and speed remain constant
sir recommend we fire a spread of photon torpedoes into their field
must we destroy them to save ourselves
it is unclear what affect a photon torpedo would have on a twodimensional beings sir
nevertheless
well we wouldnt necessarily have to fire at them half a dozen photon torpedo bursts directly in their path could make them change course
make it so
torpedoes armed fire distribution set detonation at seven kilometres ahead of the cluster
data launch another probe patch the monitor through to the main viewer
probe has been launched on screen
proceed mister worf
launching photon torpedoes detonation in five seconds three two one
there is no change in the graviton field the torpedoes are having no effect sir
fire another volley directly into their field mister worf
launching torpedoes detonation in five seconds three two one
matterantimatter explosions appear to be ineffective sir


come in janet oh im sorry i meant to cancel your appointment today actually im resigning as ships counsellor
why
i think it was fairly clear during your last appointment it was obviously non productive i couldnt sense what you were feeling
deanna you were right about me i had to go back and look at what i was doing see why i was trying to convince myself and you that i was a new woman you made me realise i was doing exactly the same thing to myself as i was before trying to hide from the pain maybe you couldnt sense what i was feeling but you helped

come
you wanted to see me captain
yes counsellor sit down please our situation has become critical the cluster remains completely unresponsive we have not been able to alter its course toward the cosmic string fragment
how much time do we have
less than five hours which is why i have called you
sir
all that remains is the possibility of communication there might be some way that we can warn them of their impending destruction
i thought data had already tried to establish communications through the universal translator
he has tried every technical means at our disposal to reach them
i wish i knew how to help captain but under the circumstances
if there is a psychology to these creatures we must discover it if there is an explanation for their behaviour we must know what it is even in your current condition you are the most qualified person aboard this ship to assist data is in observation attempting to formulate a strategy i want you to join him deanna we need you
captains log supplemental if our speed and course remain unchanged in one hour the enterprise will be torn apart by the gravitational forces of the cosmic string fragment

are your signals reaching them
possibly however the beings may perceive them as negligible noise rather than an attempt at communication
is there any evidence at all that theyre sentient
negative the nature of their movement suggests a simple order of intelligence
im sorry data i dont seem to be much help without my empathic abilities i just dont know how to draw on my human instinct
as i have no human instinct per se i cannot advise you counsellor
right now i feel as twodimensional as our friends out there in the universe but barely aware of it just trying to survive on instinct data what if theyre simply acting instinctively there are inherent inborn forces in every species what they need what they fear we have to discover what drives this species
i do not believe there is any way we can know for certain counsellor
we can speculate on the available evidence
the only evidence we have at present is the brief interruption in their movement pattern during our last attempt to break away
which may suggest some kind of awareness of our presence
otherwise their course and speed have been constant
on a straight line to the cosmic string youre convinced the strings gravitation is pulling them in
because the cluster is twodimensional i do not have enough direct evidence to support that assumption however it is the most reasonable hypothesis
why
it is unlikely they would intentionally move toward a destructive force
moths fly toward a flame horses sometimes run into a burning barn data dont you see weve been thinking in three dimensions we have to get twodimensional
pardon me
subspace signals photon torpedoes nothings had an impact it is reasonable to wonder if a gravitational pull even as strong as a cosmic strings would affect them
please continue
what if theyve chosen a course to the cosmic string a case of pure stimulus response driven by instinct just like the moth to a flame

if counsellor trois supposition is correct a replica of the string projected behind the cluster could induce them to reverse course disrupting the graviton wake long enough for us to escape
how do you simulate a cosmic string it has the gravitational force of a hundred stars
i do not suggest simulating the gravitational field of the string fragment rather the strings vibration
vibration were not talking about a violin data
no datas right the principle is still the same a cosmic string emanates a characteristic set of subspace frequencies as atomic particles decay along its event horizon i could use the ships parabolic dish to amplify and reflect those frequencies back toward the cluster the enterprise itself would echo the cosmic string
how much time do we have mister worf
twenty three minutes sir
make it so

frequencyscan detectors engaged
receiving

data were picking up frequencies across the entire electromagnetic and lower subspace spectrum trying to isolate data can you focus the reflector field for me
stand by

i am differentiating particleemission signatures now

good good thats doing it patterns are converging

same course same speed no change sir
we are beginning to encounter the gravitational effects of the string impact is in four minutes
sir shear force turbulence is impairing our ability to create an accurate simulation
geordi fire up the impulse engines activate the

ships stabilisers
stabilisers on

electromagnetic and subspace wave fronts approaching synchronisation
three minutes to impact
status
the cluster is unaffected same course same speed
lets try turning up the volume increase the intensity mister data
increasing by fifty percent
theyre slowing

gravitonwake field collapsing

mister la forge get us out of here
with pleasure sir
the beings have resumed their course into the string three seconds to impact

its all right theyre home we were wrong the cosmic string it was never dangerous to them it was the one place in the galaxy they most wanted to be
deanna
yes i sensed it

such overwhelming intensity of emotion when we first encountered them it must have been more than my senses could process
a short circuit
something like that oh beverly
apology accepted therapists are always the worst patients except for doctors of course come by and see me in my office later okay

i was so awful to her
you were just being human
i never fully appreciated how difficult and how rewarding it is to be human but i had a lot of help thanks
now is that counsellor position is still open aboard ship
its been taken
i just thought id ask better hours excuse me
and you thank you for making me face my other half
frightening isnt it
a little you were right though there is something to be learned when youre not in control of every situation
welcome to the human race
by the way the next time you call me aristocratic
datas day

second officers personal log stardate  record entry for transmission to commander bruce maddox cybernetics division daystrom institute dear commander maddox

in reference to your most recent letter i agree that your study lacks sufficient primary source information on my programming and operation therefore in response to your request this correspondence will include a complete record of my activities during a normal day with particular emphasis on my perceptions of friendship

commander riker you are fifteen minutes early
well its a very special day i thought the father of the bride would enjoy being relieved early on the wedding day
thank you sir
nervous
i cannot become nervous sir however i do sense a certain anticipation regarding my role in the wedding
anything to report
all systems normal sir sickbay reports that lieutenant juarez went into labour at zero four hundred hours we remain at station awaiting the arrival of starship zhukov and guest quarters have been prepared for ambassador tpel
very well i have the bridge
aye sir
begin day watch
initially commander maddox i found it difficult to maintain friendships since human emotions are often puzzling to me

eventually i developed a programme enabling me to predict human emotional responses to specific actions

come in
it is time for the wedding rehearsal
i know data ive decided not to go through with it
you do not wish to rehearse
no im calling off the wedding
may i ask why
its just the right thing to do
have your feelings for chief obrien changed
im supposed to be getting married data i should be happy but im not i just feel this weight pressing down on me
will cancelling the wedding make you happy
yes hell probably be just as relieved as i am data you introduced us to each other you mean a lot to both of us i would really appreciate it if you would tell miles for me
if you wish

my friend chief obrien often says that above all else he wants to make keiko happy since cancelling the wedding will make her happy i must conclude the chief will be pleased at her decision
i have good news
oh
keiko has made a decision designed to increase her happiness she has cancelled the wedding
she what cancelled the wedding today without even a word of all the childish selfish irresponsible things to do

next time maybe i should break the good news
commander maddox it would appear that my programme designed to predict the emotional responses needs adjustment
second officers personal log supplemental this is the one thousand five hundred fiftieth day since the enterprise was commissioned besides the arrival of ambassador tpel other events occurring today include four birthdays two personnel transfers a celebration of the hindu festival of lights two chess tournaments one secondary school play and four promotions overall an ordinary day

the zhukov is ready for transport sir
energise
welcome aboard the enterprise ambassador
i would meet with your captain

sine i am not affected by emotional considerations i am closer to being vulcan than human however while their devotion to logic does have a certain appeal i find their stark philosophy to be somewhat limited

come ambassador tpel
i come to serve
your service honours us this is my first officer commander william riker
leave us please

charming woman
the tone of commander rikers voice makes me suspect that he is not serious about finding ambassador tpel charming my experience suggests that in fact he may mean the exact opposite of what he says irony is a form of expression i have not yet been able to master


you dont need a haircut you were just in here last week
hey if youd done it right the first time i wouldnt be back here so soon
i know you want to look beautiful but im just a barber not a miracle worker
just try to keep my ears on straight today all right
friendly insults and jibes another form of human speech that i am attempting to master in this case with the help of commander geordi la forge
hi data
i consider geordi to be my best friend
here for a trim
my hair does not require trimming you lunkhead
what
my hair does not require trimming
lunkhead
i am experimenting with friendly jibes and insults it was not meant as a serious disparagement
well just dont try it on the captain
no geordi i am still confused by chief obriens reaction this morning
yeah he was just surprised data he didnt mean to blow up like that he knows that keiko probably doesnt want to call off the marriage shes just getting cold feet
cold feet jitters a nervous reaction to an impending event of great importance
right dont worry everythings going to be fine shell change her mind again
she will
absolutely
so you believe the wedding will still proceed
trust me theyre going to get married so youd better find a gift

i find lieutenant worf to be what is called a kindred spirit we were both orphans rescued by starfleet officers in many ways we are both still outsiders in human society
are you here to find a wedding gift
yes
i would appreciate your help in selecting an appropriate item
of course i have attended human weddings before

hold
this is a traditional gift
yes my adoptive parents often give these things at family weddings a human custom

hold
it is my understanding that the item selected should reflect the personality of whoever is giving it this does not remind me of you have you ever been an actual participant in a human wedding
no
you would not consider it to be an honour
an honour perhaps but human bonding rituals often involve a great deal of talking and dancing and crying
dancing

i am rarely in need of doctor beverly crushers professional services as my biomechanical maintenance programme is self sufficient but i often observe as she practices medicine on others and have learned a great deal about human interaction from her
doctor may i ask a favour of you
of course data
would you teach me how to dance

what
i would like to learn how to dance
why me
it was in your service record awarded first prize tap and jazz competition saint louis academy
okay okay
have i said something to upset you
its just that that was a long time ago and i dont want to be known as the dancing doctor again
then your answer is no
all right but lets keep this between you and me
of course doctor
commander data please report to the bridge
acknowledged


data i want a tactical projection of possible future romulan deployments along the neutral zone access all federation records on the subject and report to my ready room
captain is there a specific area you wish me to study
no ambassador number one set a course one three zero mark two four six warp seven
that will take us very close to the neutral zone captain
im aware of that number one proceed

lay in the course
it is fortunate that i am able to perform my duties without emotional distractions if that were not the case a sudden course correction toward the neutral zone would make me very nervous
personal log supplemental commander maddox there are still many dynamics of social interaction which i do not understand

mister data based on your analysis what is the current romulan strategy behind the deployment of their ships in this sector
their ships are deployed to support a policy of confrontation designed to test federation defenses along the neutral zone
do you predict any change in the near future
i project a ninety percent probability that they will continue to support that policy
is there any indication of a more conciliatory attitude on their part
no sir
caution is clearly called for captain however the mission must proceed as planned
starfleet command agrees with you but i would feel better if you would consent to an escort or

thank you mister data

feline supplement seventy four

computer run fluidic sensor diagnostic

diagnostic complete all systems functioning within normal parameters
come in
am i intruding commander
no would you care to sit down
when one of my friends is distraught i have learnt that the thoughtful thing to do is to attempt to make him feel more comfortable

may i offer you some refreshment chief
no thank you sir first of all id like to apologise for this morning in ten forward
there is no need to apologise i was not offended would you like a pillow or a more comfortable chair to sit upon
no sir thank you sir
perhaps you would like some music brahms aurelia
no really sir im fine i came to ask for your help its about keiko id like you to talk to her convince her to go through with the wedding
would counsellor troi not be a more appropriate choice to speak with keiko
she already has it didnt help youve known her longer than i have i just thought she might listen to you she wont even talk to me
i do not know what to say to her
just talk with her make her see reason shes going off halfcocked not thinking this through youve worked with her for a long time she respects your opinion
perhaps she has not fully analysed her decision i will try
thank you sir i wont forget this
commander maddox i noted that keiko was quite calm and rational when she informed me of her decision this morning therefore i can predict that she will respond to an objective analysis of the situation based on the available facts it is fortunate that she has not let emotional considerations cloud her judgement it should make my task much simpler

what
i believe you made an incorrect analysis of the facts at hand
what do you mean
you do not seem happy
well
your decision was based on the assumption that cancelling the wedding would bring you happiness this has proved to be incorrect
data its not that simple
since your action did not produce the desired results the only advisable solution should be to reexamine your decision making process and look for errors
i knew what i was doing its my decision
that fact is not in dispute however you may have acted with undue haste and in doing so unintentionally hurt chief obriens feelings
i did what i had to why are you doing this i thought you were my friend
i am your friend
then leave me alone
if i have offended
just leave me alone
it is clear that i need guidance to resolve this situation counsellor trois advice should be useful

in many ways deanna troi is the friend that i understand the least her life and her duties are predicated on her understanding and perception of emotions since i have none no doubt she finds me as much of a mystery as i find her
chief obrien talks to me keiko talks to you why do they not talk to each other
thats a good question data i wish i had a good answer for you perhaps when theyre ready they will
many aspects of this situation are puzzling to me i have been studying various texts on the subject of marriage but i have not found a suitable guide
a suitable guide for what
in an effort to be helpful i am attempting to calculate the variables involved in a successful marriage
good luck
there are many opinions on galvin five a marriage is considered successful only if children are produced within a year of the wedding andorian marriages require groups of four people unless
data would you like my advice on how to help them dont this is something they have to work out for themselves
but i am their friend should i not stand with them in a time of difficulty
there are many ways to help a friend and sometimes the best way is to leave them alone
do you believe it to be the right decision for them to marry
i dont know theyre very much in love but sometimes that isnt enough marriage is an agreement to share who you are with someone else to spend your lives together to grow old together
to grow old together that is an integral component of marriage
usually why do you ask
although i am an android i have not excluded the possibility that i too may someday marry
data i had no idea youd thought about getting married
i believe i have much to offer a potential mate however we cannot grow old together because i will not grow old
data you do have a lot to offer
commander data this is ambassador tpel please report to my quarters
acknowledged


enter

you have priority three clearance aboard the enterprise
that is correct ambassador
i require information on this ships defence and navigational systems access code kappa alpha four six zero one seven zero four
the code is valid
what is the field strength of the ships deflector shields at maximum output
may i ask the purpose of your request
i require the information
i have the same safeguards as the ships computer therefore i must report any inquiry regarding restricted information to the captain your reaction suggests you do not wish the captain to be informed of your inquiry
i was not interested in the information i was curious as to your security safeguards they appear to be adequate cancel the request you may leave

commander maddox i have often wished for the sense that humans call intuition or instinct since vulcans are incapable of lying i must accept the ambassadors explanation as the truth but i would still prefer a gut feeling to back up this conclusion

programme crusher four in progress


hi data well what do you think it is a recreation of the studio i had my first dance lesson in
it appears to be quite suitable doctor
lets start with something simple stomp hop try it

again good good
am i dancing doctor
not quite stop data now try this
doctor perhaps it would be beneficial to show me the final lesson
okay

thats great watch good triples watch stop data and you say youve never done this before try this

stop data not bad  yeah not bad
then i have successfully learned to dance
id say youve picked up the basics
thank you doctor i am now prepared to dance at the wedding
wedding
keikos wedding
data you never told me this was for the wedding
is that important
well yes they dont do a lot of tap dancing at weddings
why
well data because i dont really know why look why dont i just teach you a style of dancing that they will do at the wedding computer run isnt it romantic

compared to what weve just doing this will be simple just look up and follow me one two ready and

no data wait a minute ow no no youre just ow move slowly ow ow stop music
sorry doctor
i dont understand data you picked up the tap dancing so quickly
i cannot reproduce your performance if i cannot see your feet
all right lets try it again and this time watch my feet computer start music and

now dont just imitate me youve got to lead
lead where doctor
indicate to your partner where you want her to step
and how is that accomplished
ill show you ill lead now youll notice that i dont just repeat the same pattern over and over i improvise now you lead thats good now look up data look into my eyes youre holding me too tight
this is a very complex set of variables to coordinate doctor
you are doing fine now smile act like youre enjoying yourself
doctor crusher please report to sickbay
is it lieutenant juarez
yes doctor her contractions are now one minute apart
im on my way why dont you programme up an artificial dance partner and dont be afraid to experiment
i will thank you doctor
computer create dance partner female begin music

and just as the headsman swings his axe the blade is about to fall 
commander rikers easy going manner and sense of humour is fascinating to me i believe it to be one reason he is so popular among the crew it may also be partly responsible for his success in matters of love there may be a correlation between humour and sex the need for more research is clearly indicated
commander
picard to the bridge all stop
aye sir

sir we have reached the designated coordinates
hold this position long range scan
captain i am detecting a ship in the neutral zone configuration romulan warbird
yellow alert hail the warbird mister worf
aye sir they are responding text only we are to proceed to the agreed coordinates
set course zero three seven mark zero zero five warp four take us into the neutral zone ensign

captain the warbird is holding position in three minutes we will be within phaser range
red alert i trust my crew ambassador they will take no provocative action unless i order them
hold position on these coordinates
slow to half impulse
open a channel
open
i am ambassador tpel
i am admiral mendak
there is no established protocol for a meeting of this nature the logical course is that i transport aboard your ship and begin the negotiations
yes captain i note your defensive systems have been activated
as have yours
it was not meant as an accusation indeed i salute your show of strength ambassador we are honoured by your presence you may transport aboard at your convenience
the honour is mine

have your transporter room stand by i will beam to their ship with no further delay
ambassador i urge you once more to reconsider the enterprise can accommodate a romulan delegation without sacrificing our security or
captain picard i find your argument illogical please carry out my instructions
picard to chief obrien
obrien here
prepare to transport ambassador tpel to the romulan ship
aye sir
mister worf maintain a lock on her signal once shes aboard at the first sign of trouble i want to be able to bring her back
understood transporter activated captain
transporter emergency im losing her signal
boosting power to autosequencers
engaging computer override
obrien what happened down there
im losing the pattern trying to re establish im sorry sir i wasnt able to retrieve the signal the ambassadors dead
second officers personal log supplemental the risks aboard a starship are accepted by all who serve but i have never failed to observe a deep emotional response to the loss of a comrade it is at times like this that i greatly miss the ability to share human feelings

the signal lock wasnt broken sir i had just entered the transfer sequence when the ambassadors pattern began to break up i tried to switch to emergency manual control but the pattern deteriorated too quickly and
captain there is no prior record of this type of accident occurring aboard a starship backup systems and safeguards are designed to prevent just such an occurrence
i cant find any system flaws in the unit captain the engineering status reports were all normal none of the backups were activated and the autosequencers were all functioning normally
any prior malfunctions on this transporter unit
no sir in fact we replaced the transition coils only last week
could there have been some kind of interference from the romulans
nothing that i could see their shields were down there was no power interruption no subspace bias
i want this unit pulled and its systems checked again i want a level one diagnostic on all transporters
yes sir
her molecular structure dissipated instantly once the pattern was lost there were some organic compounds left on the pad but there wasnt enough material to do an autopsy
to die on a transporter hardly a fitting end for one of the federations most honoured diplomats
bridge to captain picard admiral mendak is hailing he wishes to speak with you

were still waiting captain is there a problem
theres been an accident ambassador tpel has been killed in a transporter malfunction
what kind of malfunction
we are still investigating that as soon as
i should have known the federation wasnt serious about this conference
admiral i assure you the federation places the highest priority on this mission and its goal
well played captain well played starfleet opposes normalisation of relations with the romulan empire and so you are ordered to create an accident
youre mistaken i am ready and willing to discuss the establishment of full diplomatic relations under the same terms as ambassador tpel
a generous offer since you know we were willing only to negotiate with tpel i salute you again captain it was a manoeuvre worthy of a romulan i suggest we both leave the neutral zone before there is another accident
set course for federation territory warp two engage mister data i want you to take charge of this investigation study computer logs sensor information everything i refuse to believe that this was a simple malfunction
aye sir
captain picard was the person who first interested me in the works of sir arthur conan doyle i have subsequently become a great admirer of the fictional detective sherlock holmes and his ability to solve mysteries by careful examination of the available evidence


i have found holmes methodology of deductive reasoning to be quite useful one of his adages is that once you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth

im sorry i dont have time to give you another lesson right now data
that is not my purpose i would like to examine the remains of ambassador tpel left on the transporter pad
im working on the report right now
have you compared the genetic code with the ambassadors last recorded transporter id traces
no thats not standard procedure why
i could be chasing an untamed ornithoid without a cause
a wildgoose chase all right computer access the transporter id trace for ambassador tpel all right theres the genetic record of the ambassador when she beamed aboard the enterprise now the breakdown of the organic material found on the transporter pad should be identical mitochondrial structure fits the general parameters no change in the nucleotide bases theres a slight discrepancy in the base pair sequence chemically these are identical however the organic sample from the transporter is showing numerous singlebit errors like replicated material
can you postulate an explanation for the discrepancy
id say the dna was either mutated by the transporter during the rematerialisation process
a supposition not supported by the transporter records
or these arent the remains of the ambassador

the only abnormality found during my investigation was a temporary increase in the matter to energy signal ratio due to the circumstances i decided to investigate the possibility that a second transporter signal had caused the fluctuation although this was highly improbable it was the only remaining theory
a second transporter signal from where
from the devoras
romulan transporters operate on a similar subspace frequency to our own with only minor adjustments they can be made to simulate our own transporter carrier wave
are you saying they beamed the ambassador off our own pad
while simultaneously a small amount of genetically similar material was left in the ambassadors place
to make us believe she had died as a result of the malfunction
yes sir
mister worf where is the devoras now
the ship is still in the neutral zone on course zero seven nine mark one two five speed warp two
heading for home
the safest and most logical decision in this situation is to contact starfleet and await further instructions however based on past experience i project only a seventeen percent chance captain picard will choose that alternative
red alert all hands stand to battle stations

lay in an intercept course for the romulan ship
shields up load all torpedo bays stand by phasers
warp factor eight engage

open a channel to the devoras
aye sir no response
the devoras is dropping out of warp sir their weapon systems are powering up
go to impulse power
aye sir
message coming in sir
on screen
captain you agreed to leave the neutral zone without
admiral mendak you have taken our ambassador captive
i can assure you there is no one being held captive aboard this ship
we know about the transporter malfunction and that you are holding ambassador tpel
captain romulan warbird decloaking to starboard
i suggest you leave now
it is my responsibility to protect the lives of federation citizens i will not permit this abduction to succeed
captain youre not going to start an incident which might
admiral mendak i will take whatever action is necessary to obtain the return of the ambassador
in the game of poker there is a moment when a player must decide if an opponent is being deceptive or actually holds a winning hand this decision is based not only on the odds but also on an appraisal of the man is he bluffing or does he have the cards
fortunately captain i am not ready to start a war today

tpel
subcommander selok actually
a spy
a patriot captain she has performed her service to the empire with distinction
thank you for your help captain
you see now that we are not holding one of your citizens and we thank you for returning our sister to us but my patience has limits the game is over i expect you to leave peacefully now
captain long range sensors detect three romulan warbirds entering this sector
some days you get the bear and some days the bear gets you
reverse course take us back to federation territory warp six engage

keiko i need your help i have offended you and need to find a way to rectify my mistake i am not sure what to do
you havent offended me
i should not have interfered it would be best if i apologised
it would be best if you got dressed for the wedding
but
come here i have the most beautiful carnation for the father of the bride now dont be nervous
i am not nervous i am confused


since the days of the first wooden sailing ships all captains have enjoyed the happy privilege of joining together two people in the bonds of matrimony and so it is my honour to unite you keiko ishikawa and you miles edward obrien together in matrimony
there are still many human emotions i do not fully comprehend anger hatred revenge but i am not mystified by the desire to be loved or the need for friendship these are things i do understand

congratulations


i was looking for doctor crusher
shh
the juarez child
a boy at the same time we were facing destruction this small miracle was taking place welcome aboard


all systems normal sir we are on course for adelphous four engineering is realigning the main deflector dish sickbay reports lieutenant umbato broke two ribs during a holodeck exercise and sensors continue to gather longrange information on the murasaki quasar
very well i have the bridge
aye sir
if being human is not simply a matter of being born flesh and blood if it is instead a way of thinking acting and feeling then i am hopeful that one day i will discover my own humanity
begin night watch
until then commander maddox i will continue learning changing growing and trying to become more than what i am
the wounded

captains log stardate  we are on a mapping survey near the cardassian sector it has been nearly a year since a peace treaty ended the long conflict between the federation and cardassia

captain we are nearing the periphery of sector twenty one five oh three
be on the lookout for a cardassian patrol ship mister worf they should be hailing us soon
even with a treaty theyre still skittish about protecting their border
last time i was in this sector i was on the stargazer running at warp speed ahead of a cardassian warship
running captain you thats hard to believe
believe it id been sent to make preliminary overtures to a truce id lowered my shields as a gesture of good will but the cardassians were not impressed they had taken out most of my weapons and damaged the impulse engines before i could regroup and run
the cardassians have no honour i do not trust them
theyre our allies now mister worf we have to trust them
trust is earned not given away
i hope their scout ship makes contact soon its not a good idea to stay too long on a cardassian border without making your intentions known


what is it
kelp buds plankton loaf and sea berries
sweetheart im not a fish
its very healthy i had this every morning when i was growing up
what no muffins or oatmeal or corned beef and eggs
for breakfast
keiko ive been thinking youve been introducing me to all this wonderful food that youre accustomed to id like to do the same isnt that what marriage is about sharing
what kind of foods
scalloped potatoes mutton shanks oxtails and cabbage
kind of heavy
oh youll love it i promise i can still remember the aromas when my mother was cooking
she cooked
she didnt believe in a replicator she thought real food was more nutritious
she handled real meat she touched it and cut it
yeah like a master chef she was fantastic of course ill have to use the replicator but ill make something special for you tonight youll love it i promise
okay maybe ill have something special for you tonight too

somethings wrong
red alert take emergency stations

cardassian ship preparing to fire again sir
increase power to forward shields hail them again mister worf
what the hell is he doing damage report
minor damage to secondary hull before we put our shields up sir no casualties structural integrity intact
engineering to bridge starboard power coupling is down
evasive action delta sequence ready phasers mister worf
delta evasion plan initiated
limit targets to engines and shields
aye sir ready
fire
direct hit sir moderate damage to their aft shield generators
continue phaser fire
multiple hits sir power failure in forward shields
the cardassian ship is standing down sir
lets see if theyll answer our hail now mister worf
frequency open
this is captain jeanluc picard of the federation starship enterprise
i am gul macet of the cardassian ship trager
why have you fired on us
a curious question captain in war one attacks ones enemies
there is a treaty between our peoples
perhaps that fact was unknown to the federation starship which destroyed our space station in the cuellar system two days ago
a federation starship
attacked an unarmed science station they had barely enough time to send an emergency signal before they were incinerated
gul macet the federation and the cardassians have struggled too hard for peace to abandon it so easily
we are not the ones who abandoned it captain
let me talk to my superiors find out whats behind this give me one hour the alternative is for us to continue firing at one other and in such a contest you would be at a disadvantage
very well one hour


captain weve confirmed your report it was the starship phoenix under the command of benjamin maxwell
ben maxwell but hes one of starfleets finest captains he must have had provocation
i wish we knew hes gone on silent running doesnt answer our communiqus
then hes still in cardassian space
the station he destroyed was in sector twenty one five oh five youre the nearest starship we want you to go in and find him
will the cardassians cooperate
theyve granted you safe passage weve agreed that youll take along a delegation of observers as a show of good faith jeanluc i dont have to tell you the federation is not prepared for a new sustained conflict you must preserve the peace no matter what the cost haden out

there will be three cardassians transporting aboard their captain gul macet and two of his aides my intention is to be as open as possible with them allow them to share in our search for the phoenix
sir it is necessary to assign them a security detail
theyre our guests mister worf i dont want them to feel like prisoners
i tend to agree with mister worf captain i think we should limit their access while theyre on board they dont need to have the run of the ship
at least allow me to post guards in some of the sensitive areas of the ship
very well lets limit their access but you instruct your people they are guests
aye sir
counsellor i want you to stay as close to the crew as possible some of them may feel uncomfortable with cardassians on board i dont want any incidents
yes captain
mister data is there anyone else on board who served previously with captain benjamin maxwell
accessing chief obrien served under his command aboard the rutledge sir
indeed number one will you and the counsellor meet our guests in transporter room three and inform chief obrien i will be calling on him
yes sir


welcome to the enterprise im first officer william riker counsellor deanna troi
i am gul macet my aides glinn daro glinn telle
this is our transporter chief mister obrien shall we

captains log supplemental we have entered cardassian territory and are proceeding on our quest to locate the phoenix


and with long range sensors weve been scanning a radius of ten light years we can effectively scan one sector in a day
were scanning sector twenty one five oh five now theres still no sign of the phoenix
in fact you have no assurance that the ship is still in sector twenty one five oh five
in fact we have no idea where it is we thought the last known coordinates were a reasonably good place to start
captain picard you can understand that we are sceptical do you expect us to believe that you are using every means at your disposal to track down one of your own
of course you are concerned gul macet it is precisely because of that fact that i have included you in every aspect of our effort youre present with my staff youre hearing reports as i hear them nothing edited nothing withheld
very well
transporter chief obrien has served with benjamin maxwell i thought that he might be able to provide some insights mister obrien i understand that captain maxwell lost his family during a raid on an outpost
more like sabotage sir it was on setlik three a squad of cardassian militia made a sneak raid on an outpost wiped out close to a hundred civilians
then its revenge hes after
thats not what i meant
maxwell is taking retribution for his own loss
captain maxwell would never
gentlemen please lets not indulge in speculation can we confine our discussion to facts now mister obrien
worf to captain picard
go ahead mister worf
long range sensors have located the phoenix
gul macet will you join me on the bridge


deck six
deck ten your captain is most impressive
yes he is
chief obrien our transporting system is still operating with active feed pattern buffers i would like to talk with you about your technology
ill have to get commander la forges approval on that
i understand in the meantime were going to your ten forward will you join us
if my commander tells me to discuss the transporter with you i will if captain picard orders me to tell you everything i know about ben maxwell i will but who i choose to spend my free time with thats my business

captain the phoenix in sector twenty one five oh five
ensign set a course warp six mister worf send a message by subspace tell them to prepare for a rendezvous
yes captain
captain a suggestion
yes
we have a number of ships in sector twenty one five oh five if you will give us more precise coordinates and the ships coded transponder frequency we would be able to intercept maxwell far more quickly than you
im sure thats true however given the circumstances i would prefer to make the initial contact myself im sure you would if the situation were reversed
captain time is crucial you have a dangerous man out there with a huge arsenal at his command if he is intent on revenge against my people he must be stopped before he can do more damage
captain so far we have an isolated incident if i can reach him first then perhaps diplomacy can prevail but if one of your ships decides to retaliate there is a danger we could lose control of the situation
then you will not give us the means to find his precise location
no i wont

there you are potato casserole a dish fit for kings

 the minstrel boy to the war has gone
whats that youre singing
what oh its just an old song a bunch of us used to sing it together on the rutledge i hadnt thought about it in years
whats it about
oh its about war and glory  the minstrel boy to the war has gone in the ranks of death you will find him his fathers sword he hath girded on and his wild harp slung behind him captain maxwell always liked that song i guess its all this business with him and the cardassians brought it back to me you know sitting with the staff this morning i could tell there were people in that room who still dont like the cardassians
i imagine thats to be expected
you do
sure the war lasted a long time that takes its toll on people what are these little dark things
capers but the fighting is over now why should anyone still feel however they feel
you fought the cardassians didnt you
well there were some skirmishes when i was with captain maxwell
well how do you feel about them
me i feel fine i mean the wars over now


the pursuing ship is the phoenix
and the other
it appears it be a cardassian supply ship
how would you know that
we are able to make that determination
you can read our transponder codes
the important thing at the moment is that one of your ships may be in jeopardy mister worf has there been any answer to our communication
no captain
put out a repeating message on all subspace channels priority one communiqu break off your pursuit immediately
aye sir
gul macet you see we are doing everything in our power to reach the phoenix
yes and accomplishing nothing im sorry to say can you show me the location of our other ships
mister data
there you see we have a warship which could intercept the phoenix before its too late if you will give us the transponder frequency or are you going to stand there while our ship is destroyed captain
mister worf has there been any response to our hails
no captain
very well mister worf relay the prefix codes of the phoenix to the cardassian warship
sir they will be able to dismantle its shields the phoenix will not have a chance
i cannot allow maxwell to ambush that supply ship mister worf now
yes captain

sir the cardassian warship is moving on the phoenix
mister data overlay weapon ranges of the two ships
the warship is three hundred thousand kilometres from the phoenix it is opening fire the phoenix has taken a direct hit the phoenix is beginning evasive manoeuvres it has positioned itself outside the weapons range of the opposing ship the phoenix has powered up both phasers and photon torpedoes the phoenix is firing photon torpedoes

he has destroyed our warship
does the supply ship have any weapons
very limited certainly not enough to defeat a nebula class starship
sir the phoenix is firing on the

the warship carried a crew of six hundred the supply ship fifty
mister data estimated time to intercept with the phoenix
at our present speed of warp four sixteen hours forty four minutes
ensign increase to warp nine

captain
chief i wanted to talk to you
anything i can do sir you know that
ben maxwell he must be quite a man
hes a rare one all right i count myself lucky sir ive served with the two finest captains in starfleet
from your knowledge of the man what has gone wrong
theres a reason for what hes doing those cardassians were up to something im sure of it
when his family was killed how did he take it
id say he took it well oh i know he was broken up inside who wouldnt be but youd never know it to see him he never missed a minutes duty always had a smile a joke
i see
he would never retaliate out of vengeance no matter what that cardassian says theyre up to something sir theyre the ones you should be investigating not captain maxwell
you dont care for the cardassians
i like them fine its just well i know them you learn to watch your back when youre around those people
ben maxwell has just sent more than six hundred of them to their deaths
i dont know what to say sir but he must have had his reasons
i think when one has been angry for a very long time one gets used to it and it becomes comfortable like old leather and finally it becomes so familiar that one cant ever remember feeling any other way thank you chief


kanar
mind if i join you
do you want another and an ale
kanar i never could develop a taste for it
it takes a bit of getting used to
i wanted to say i owe you an apology i shouldnt have popped off like that in the turbolift
i think
heres your ale mister obrien
this has been hard on all of us i know ill be happy when im back on my own ship
i guess thats true i hadnt thought of it like that i was on setlik three with captain maxwell the morning after the massacre we were too late of course almost everyone was dead
that was a terrible mistake we were told the outpost was a launching place for a massive attack against us
the only people left alive were in an outlying district of the settlement i was sent there with a squad to reinforce them cardassians were advancing on us moving through the streets destroying killing i was with a group of women and children when two cardassian soldiers burst in i stunned one of them the other jumped me we struggled one of the women threw me a phaser and i fired the phaser was set at maximum the man just incinerated there before my eyes id never killed anything before when i was a kid id worry about swatting a mosquito its not you i hate cardassian i hate what i became because of you


i will protest this klingon
lieutenant
he was found at a computer station on deck thirty five attempting to access information on our weapon systems
a lie gul macet i was studying the terminal interface systems theyre more efficient than ours i have no idea what was in the files
what business did you have going near one of their computers
but gul macet i meant nothing there was no harm done
go to your quarters you are confined there for the duration of this expedition
as you wish sir
mister worf please accompany him
gladly captain

captain may we speak in private
you have the bridge number one

i deeply regret what my aide has done captain you have my word he will be disciplined upon my return
you may take whatever action against him you feel is appropriate i consider the matter closed
im not sure i would be so generous in your place captain thank you
if there is to be a lasting peace gul macet neither you nor i must allow any one man to undermine our efforts
there are those who crave war who need it i am not one of them captain and im beginning to see that neither are you we have had our full measure the lasting peace begins here with the two of us
bridge to captain
picard here
we have located the phoenix sir we will intercept it in twenty two minutes
captains log stardate  we have established communication with captain maxwell and he has agreed to come on board

welcome aboard sir im commander riker first officer
i know all about you commander fine work you did with the borg we all owe you on that one
thank you sir
obrien miles obrien
hello captain good to see you again
how are you i had no idea you were on the enterprise this was my tactical officer on the rutledge best i ever had
thank you sir
obrien has the ability to size up a situation instantly then come up with options to fit all contingencies remarkable
well if thats true i learned it from you sir
but you got that silver tongue by kissing the stone right well commander best i see your captain straight away weve got a lot to talk about
yes sir

captain jeanluc picard captain benjamin maxwell
thatll be all commander

captain
a pleasure captain
please sit down
you must think ive gone mad
the thought had occurred
picard i have to tell you i was grateful when i realised it was you starfleet sent after me somebody who knows what its really like out here
i know of nothing out here that could possibly justify what you have done
then listen to this the cardassians are arming again that socalled science station military supply port
how do you know this
information comes my way
from whom where is your documentation
i know what theyre doing i can smell it theres no good reason for a science station in the cuellar system but its a hell of a strategic site for a military transport station a jumpingoff point into three federation sectors theyre running supply ships back and forth and nobodys going to tell me its for scientific research
but whatever circumstances you encountered why didnt you notify starfleet
and wait six months while the bureaucrats sit around reading reports trying to figure out what to do they dont know whats going on out here but you should picard you know what its like to be under fire
you werent under fire
lives were at stake
whose lives
we had to act now
why
it smells musty in here like a bureaucrats office
you have killed nearly seven hundred people and you have taken us to the brink of war
i have prevented war or at the very least delayed it a good long time the peace treaty was a ruse to give them breathing room time to regroup
and so all alone you decided to dispose of the treaty
i took the initiative i did what had to be done
what had to be done for whom why does a man with a long and brilliant service abandon the fundamental principles that he has believed in even fought for all his life i believe it is because of what they did to your wife and your children
not true not true
to avenge their deaths
youre a fool picard history will look at you and say this man was a fool
ill accept the judgement of history
when it becomes clear what the cardassians have done i will be vindicated
what the cardassians have or have not done is irrelevant
irrelevant come with me find one of their supply ships and well see how irrelevant it is
were not going after any more cardassian ships youre going to return to your bridge and set a course for starbase two one one the phoenix and the enterprise will return to federation space together those are starfleets orders i will permit you the dignity of retaining your command during the voyage the only alternative is to put you in the brig and to tow your ship back to starbase in disgrace
i will return to my ship
you understand your orders
yes captain
mister worf report to my ready room my guest is departing
aye sir
captains log supplemental with the phoenix in close formation we are proceeding directly to starbase two one one

mister data how long until we clear cardassian space
at our present speed three hours twenty minutes sir
mister worf send a message to admiral haden at starfleet inform him of our projected time of arrival
aye sir
captain the phoenix has changed course
what is he doing
ensign change course to pursue mister worf will you hail captain maxwell
no response sir
data project his new course
sir the phoenix is heading directly for a cardassian vessel point one two light years from our location
hell attack that ship just as he did the others
continue the hail mister worf priority one message do you know what that ship might be
i imagine its a supply ship headed for the research station in the kelrabi system
the phoenix still does not respond sir
ensign warp eight overtake him
captain the phoenix has accelerated to warp nine we will not be able to reach him before he intercepts the cardassian ship
ensign warp nine
aye sir
mister worf arm phasers continue the hail
aye sir
captain chief obrien was maxwells tactical officer
get him up here

sir the phoenix has dropped out of warp they have reached the cardassian vessel
slow to impulse
vessels are within visual range
on screen
has the phoenix activated its weapon systems
negative sir their phaser banks are not armed
what about the cardassians
our sensors are unable to determine status of the cardassian defensive systems their ship is running with a high powered subspace field
mister obrien your former commander a federation captain is about to place me in the position of firing on his ship i need your knowledge of the man how he thinks what hes capable of doing
aye sir
sir captain maxwell is hailing us
on screen
all right picard you need proof youve got it now
captain maxwell you have disobeyed a direct order
board the ship youll see that everything ive been saying is true
the cardassian vessel will not be boarded you will transport yourself aboard the enterprise
picard if you dont board that ship ill destroy it
and i will use whatever force is necessary to prevent you from taking that action captain

sir captain maxwell if he feels his back is to the wall hell strike
captain the phoenix is transferring power to its shields
theyre arming phasers and loading forward torpedo bays
red alert it seems you were right mister obrien ready phasers load torpedoes
phasers armed loading forward and aft torpedo bays
sir let me beam over try to talk to him we served together a long time when youve been through what we have you tend to get inside someone he might listen
hed never drop his shields and allow you to transport on board
the phoenix is using a high energy sensor system it cycles every five point five minutes between cycles theres a window of a fiftieth of a second trust me i can get through
make it so

not now

im not armed
how the devil did you get over here
i had the thought that if we could talk we could figure a way out of this mess
the way out of this is clear talk to picard get him to board the damned ship
he wont do that sir
but hed turn his weapons on a federation starship to protect the enemy i dont believe it
he will count on it
what the hell has happened to this war
sir there is no war the war is over
youre wrong the cardassians live to make war
thats what everybody thinks about the enemy thats probably what they think about us
were not the same at all we do not start wars we do not make surprise attacks on manned outposts we do not butcher women and children in their homes children who never got the chance to grow up you were with me on setlick you saw what they did
yes sir
what was the name of the fellow who always hung around you like a puppy
will kayden stompie
stompie as cool under fire as a mountain lake
yes sir
he died at setlick didnt he
yes sir
what was that song of his the one he always sang the one i liked
 the minstrel boy to the war has gone in the ranks of death you will find him
his fathers sword he hath girded on and his wild harp slung behind him land of song said the warrior bard tho all the world betrays thee one sword at least thy rights shall guard
one faithful harp shall praise thee
im not going to win this one am i chief
no sir
captains log supplemental captain maxwell has turned his ship over to his first officer and transported aboard the enterprise i have confined him to quarters for the return voyage

thank you chief
id just like to say sir he was a good man what he did was terribly wrong i know that now but im still proud to have served with him
thank you chief and well done thatll be all

his loyalty is admirable even if it is misplaced
the loyalty you would so quickly dismiss does not come easily to my people gul macet you have much to learn about us benjamin maxwell earned the loyalty of those who served with him you know in war he was twice honoured with the federations highest citation for courage and valour and if he could not find a role for himself in peace we can pity him but we shall not dismiss him
you are welcome to your opinion captain i for one am grateful he is under lock and key
one more thing macet maxwell was right those ships were not carrying scientific equipment were they a research station within arms reach of three federation sectors cargo ships running with high energy subspace fields that jam sensors
if you believed the transport ship was carrying weapons captain why didnt you board it as maxwell requested
i was here to protect the peace a peace that i firmly believe is in the interests of both our peoples if i had attempted to board that ship i am quite certain that you and i would not be having this pleasant conversation and that ships on both sides would now be arming for war
captain i assure you
take this message to your leaders gul macet well be watching
devils due



you dont believe in me
i dont
what evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses
i dont know
why do you doubt your senses
because a little thing affects them a slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats you may be an undigested bit of beef a blot of mustard a crumb of cheese a fragment of an underdone potato why theres more of gravy than of grave about you whatever you are humbug i tell you humbug

freeze programme very well done data your performance skills really are improving
your courtesy is appreciated sir but i am aware that i do not effectively convey the fear called for in this scene
well youve never known fear data but as an acute observer of behaviour you should be able to approximate it
sir that is not an appropriate basis for an effective performance not by the standards set by my mentors
your mentors
yes sir i have studied the philosophies of virtually every known acting master i find myself attracted to stanislavsky adler garnav proponents of an acting technique known as the method


method acting im vaguely familiar with it but why would you choose such an oldfashioned approach
perhaps because the technique requires an actor to seek his own emotional awareness to understand the character he plays
but surely thats an impossible task for you data
sir i have modified the method for my own uses since i have no emotional awareness to create a performance i am attempting to use performance to create emotional awareness i believe if i can learn to duplicate the fear of ebenezer scrooge i will be one step closer to truly understanding humanity
captain picard please report to the bridge
on my way number one data the moment you decided to stop imitating other actors and create your own interpretation you were already one step closer to understanding humanity

weve received an emergency transmission from the science station on ventax two sir
whats the nature of the emergency
uncertain the signal was interrupted
contact reestablished with ventax two sir
on screen

i am doctor howard clark director of the science station here on ventax two thank you for responding
worf can you improve our reception
the trouble is at the transmission source sir
doctor clark we are barely able maintain communication with you can you boost the level of your power source
im afraid not captain its under attack
under attack
theres a mob outside the door trying to break into the station the planet is in chaos lootings fires mass hysteria these people are all convinced their world is coming to an end tomorrow please we must have your immediate
captains log stardate  we have reached ventax two and are attempting to contact the federation science station which at last report was under siege by an angry mob

they are transmitting again
on screen before we lose contact
enterprise enterprise do you read me emergency we need help
doctor clark this is captain picard we are ready to beam you and your staff on board the
theyre in
transporter room three lock onto the science team and beam them aboard
ive locked onto doctor clark i cant pick out the others its a mess down there
then beam doctor clark aboard by himself
yes captain
mister worf will you escort him to my ready room
aye sir
number one try to make some sense out of this mess

the people in ventax two live in an agrarian society at least they do now
what do you mean now
its an interesting anthropological question one we were studying before the trouble began in the distant past the ventaxian culture had achieved an extremely advanced scientific level but a millennium ago they turned their backs on technology
they reverted to a simpler existence
and remained that way for centuries first contact was made by a klingon expedition seventy years ago since then the new technology has been available to the ventaxians they simply are not interested in it virtually no social problems to be found on this planet in fact i would have described their society as idyllic until
until what doctor
its hard to believe several years ago acost jared the ventaxian head of state began to grow increasingly obsessed with the legend of ardra with each passing day he grew more anxious and he talked about little else ardra is coming back ardra will be here soon we must all leave before ardra returns
and who is this ardra
for all intents and purposes the devil captain these people actually believe theyve sold their souls to the devil
riker to captain picard
have you located the science team number one
evidently theyre being held hostage
hostage
theres a ventaxian leader on the viewscreen name of acost jared
doctor

jared you must secure the release of my people i cant believe you would allow this
howard my friend you know how i abhor all acts of violence but events are out of my control
im captain jeanluc picard is there nothing you can do
as the hour of ardras return approaches fear has overwhelmed my people it has been a thousand years the prophecies have come true
prophecies
ardras arrival was supposed to be heralded by the shaking of the cities now there has been a series of geological tremors on the planet minor quakes nothing extraordinary
poorly timed
there is more for several nights there have been visions of ardra again just as the contract said would occur before her return
visions do you mean dreams
no she has appeared i myself have seen her
jared tell your people if the hostages are released i am prepared to offer federation assistance should this this ardra return
i am afraid it will not matter they know your weapons are useless against her captain i will make inquiries concerning the hostages the innocent should not suffer from our sins but i can make no promises

this situation is deteriorating captain the people are approaching levels of anxiety that could lead to suicide
mister data what do we know about this ardra
she is a cornerstone of ventaxian theology it seems that ardra came to ventax two and promised one thousand years of peace and prosperity for a price upon her return she would enslave the entire population in ventaxian culture it is considered bad luck to speak her name out loud clark there are ancient scrolls concerning ardra that are stored in the athenaeum vaults scholars study them they have been of little public interest until recently
i think i should meet with this acost jared hes still our best hope for the release of the hostages
ill arrange to have him transported on board
no im going down to the planet myself
sir you run the risk of being taken as an additional hostage
mister worf you and mister data will accompany me mister obrien can keep a lock on our communicators he can pull us out if necessary
yes sir
counsellor i want you to come too


captain picard you shouldnt have come your life is in danger here
you must calm your people there is no reason for panic
no reason
if the tremors have frightened people leading to this hysteria over ardra let us reassure them
we have scanned the tectonic stress patterns of your planets crust there is no evidence that the quakes pose any kind of threat
no no no the threat is from ardra you cannot understand
if you can at least help us locate our people

she is here
nonsense it is only

times up im disappointed i expected my tenants to take better care of my property
ardra most powerful one i am jared leader of ventax two i take responsibility for all that displeases you please do not punish my people
punish who said anything about punishing i merely expect your end of our contract to be upheld
thank you ardra
and dont talk like some ancient prophet around me with thees and thous and most powerful ones it was appealing for a few centuries but i bore easily and stop cowering when i want you on your knees ill let you know  much better a fine example for the others who would you be
i am captain jeanluc picard of the federation starship enterprise
keep up the good work now the first thing well need is an accounting of all youve been accumulating for me  this form will provide guidelines for a full census of the population with emphasis on productivity and economic forecasts
who are you
my you are forceful arent you good i like my men to be forceful at least at the start
if your intent is to intimidate you are not succeeding
thats all right i like a challenge
an entire planet has been terrorised because of the suggestion that youre going to enslave the population
well its true of course i wouldnt put it so melodramatically its just a standard contract with an unusually long term
so you do purport to be the mythic figure ardra
i have many names my pale friend im mendora in the berussian cluster torak to the drellians the klingons call me feklhr
you are not feklhr

ah but i am i am the guardian of grethor where the dishonoured go when they die

but here on ventax two i am called ardra the same ardra who negotiated a contract with these people ten centuries ago today oh you doubt me a nonbeliever really jeanluc picard of the federation starship enterprise no doubt you have travelled the galaxy encountered a diverse universe of creatures is there no room for the likes of me
i have encountered many who more credibly could be called the devil than you
the devil now theres one i havent heard in a long time
you claim you visited this planet a thousand years ago and negotiated a contract
thats correct
i would like to see that contract


the scrolls of ardra captain
a longwinded description of a very simple business arrangement i did away with their wars famine and economic ruin and provided them a thousand years of paradise my terms were clearly stated they went into this with their eyes open im sure youll find everything is in order
you wont mind if i dont take your word for it jared with your permission id like mister data will review these scrolls thoroughly
it is no longer my decision captain
i have intrigued you havent i picard
i am only here to secure the release of the federation hostages
hostages is this true
yes ardra panic gripped the people as the time of your return grew closer
yes i do have that effect on people see that the hostages are released now
immediately
let us not cloud this with bit players picard you will not leave because you find me irresistible

enterprise advise doctor clark that the hostages are being released
this is clark you did it captain thank goodness
goodness had nothing to do with it three to beam up mister data will remain on the surface data i want a complete report on the contents of these documents i refuse to abandon this planet to that woman energise

could she be another refugee from the q continuum
for that matter could she be q
q would never bother with contracts
or economic forecasts
i noticed that too counsellor i had the distinct impression of in the presence of a flimflam artist
but her powers
her powers are at the best unclear think about it mister worf transporter technology can make things appear and disappear the illusion that she can transform herself into a klingon creature could be created by holographic projection
and creating a minor tremor could be the result of a low frequency tractor beam projected against the tectonic plates
we are capable of recreating all of these events its just that she dresses them up and she delivers them with more dramatic flair
like a magician
exactly
she has an incredibly focused mind it was virtually impossible to sense any deception or anything else for that matter
the best magicians will never let you see whats up their sleeve counsellor
she must be tapping into some sort of power source to produce these effects shes not hiding that up her sleeve
number one i want you and mister worf to run high resolution scans of this star system look for a ship a base of operations anything large enough to generate that power mister la forge accompany doctor clark back to the science station see if you can trace the origin of these tremors

your chair offers a lovely view of my planet picard come sit with me
either leave my bridge or i will remove you by force
by force you disappoint me you didnt strike me as that sort picard but by all means try
mister worf

i was really hoping youd try it yourself
transporter room three lock on to the intruder and transport her to the planet surface
aye sir

ensign put up the shields until further notice
 yes sir captain whatever you say
we are not impressed by your magic tricks
i pity you we live in a universe of magic which evidently you cannot see ah my pale friend has returned have you finished examining the contract
i have sir
report mister data
the contract agrees to deliver the people of ventax two into the personal servitude of ardra after one thousand years of peace i have compared the terms to the body of laws which govern the planet the language of the agreement is correct in every detail sir
such speed and accuracy youre much too talented to be human
i am an android
android of course how wonderful an unexpected bonus
bonus
yes when the contract came to term i gained clear title to the planet anything on the surface in the air or in orbit so you see the enterprise belongs to me now as well
im afraid the contract could be interpreted in that way sir

captains log supplemental although i consider this womans claim upon my ship to be an empty threat it has further inspired my determination to expose her for the fraud she is

come
you wished to see me sir
yes mister data a wise man once said there is a sucker born every minute
barnum sir pt
ive been examining the dynamics of what used to be called the con game quite fascinating worthy of your study data
sir do you believe ardra is to use the vernacular a con artist
yes i do data and i believe it is our job to outcon the con artist
sir i must point out that the ventaxians did have one thousand years of peace and tranquility as promised by ardra
we can only speculate what occurred on that planet a thousand years ago maybe a ventaxian leader saw the destruction of his society at hand and he conceived this contract of ardra to motivate change or maybe there was an ardra of some sort who is the basis of this mythology who knows the point is that somehow a fundamental theology was created which transformed this society but in the process of change created this latent fear which has been passed down through generations data from your own experience of performing ebenezer scrooge youre aware how fear can be a very powerful motivator
indeed sir in the story the spirits used fear to motivate scrooge to reform his character
and in the hands of a con artist fear can be used to motivate obedience capitulation the exploitation of innocent people and that is what i believe has happened here i intend to prove that i need to find a loophole some way of challenging the validity of this contract
sir the language of the contract seems carefully chosen to avoid any loopholes
check it again mister data and check every ventaxian legal precedent for the last one thousand years well talk again in the morning
aye sir


picard to bridge intruder alert picard to bridge
oh ive arranged for a bit of privacy

just the two of us
this is becoming very tiresome
oh come now picard you know you find me tantalising give in to your desires
you know theres nothing about you i find tantalising on the contrary i find you obvious and vulgar
easily fixed  i can be your ideal woman picard prim and proper and chaste until i succumb to your charms or would your fantasies turn more toward a professional woman one perhaps who wears a starfleet uniform perhaps i could even be
someone close at hand and yet unattainable i can do anything for you captain anything you could ever imagine
i could give you a night that would light fire in your dreams until you die and you would reject me
oh yes
you shall regret that
i think not
oh but you will


captain picard captain i wasnt expecting you here
neither was i
la forge to enterprise
go ahead
worf captain picard is here

youd better transport him back on board
the captain but i have no
its all right mister worf

ardra somehow transported me here will you beam me directly to my quarters
aye sir were locked on to you

transporter is malfunctioning captain

some sort of interference checking
just have mister data fetch me in a shuttle and have him bring along a uniform

did you say uniform
yes i did
aye sir

mister la forge and doctor clark have made no headway commander riker and lieutenant worf have picked nothing up anything on their scans
sir i believe i have found an obscure precedent in ventaxian law which may be of interest
yes
the case involves a contract dispute over services rendered by a klingon craftsman on the construction of a ventaxian home because the dispute involved an alien culture the parties decided that arbitration rather than the courts should resolve the issue both sides agreed to choose an arbiter it is the only known case involving an alien claimant
thats exactly what i needed well done data
shuttlecraft one to enterprise prepare for docking sequence
proceed shuttle one

enterprise enterprise do you read me enterprise come in

i cannot locate the enterprise anywhere within one light year of the planet sir
i dont believe ardra is capable of transporting the enterprise a light year away keep hailing them mister data repeat on all frequencies
hey i think weve found something here theres a sudden jump in zparticle readings just about the time the enterprise disappeared
where did it originate
it was too brief to pinpoint
but it could suggest a hidden power source
gentlemen we need to find that source if we are to defeat this woman
well if you can get her to perform a few more magic tricks like that one we just might be able to track it down

so i trust you have a bit more respect for me now
what have you done with my ship
ive done nothing with your ship my ship is safely in my possession
i do not recognise your claim on the enterprise nor on this world for that matter in accordance with ventaxian legal precedent i call for an arbitration
an arbitration theres nothing here to arbitrate
oh but there is youre a fraud madame and i intend to prove that you could not have affected the changes that took place on this planet
do you not believe what you see with your own eyes your ship is gone captain
an illusion magicians have been making things of all sorts disappear for ages
you underestimate me but then most people do until its too late
if you are who you say you are then you have nothing to lose
i also have nothing to gain i already have possession of this planet and your ship
i am prepared to offer an added incentive if you win ill take you to the ruins of ligillium
the zaterl emerald you know where it is
yes i do
oh you are too clever but i have enough jewels if you wish this foolish arbitration i will choose my own prize
and what would that be
you by all rights your body is already mine but i want more i want your heart your mind your soul and i want you to give them to me without resistance of your own free will so do you still wish to pursue this most dangerous game
i agree to your terms
oh picard i will enjoy you morning noon and night
but we must agree to an arbiter
very well i choose mister data any objections
but mister data is a member of my crew
of my crew and hes an android he is incapable of deceit or bias he has no feelings to get in the way of his judgment
ardra before he responds may i have a word in private with captain picard

sir i request you reject me as arbitrator
why
ardra is right if i am chosen i will perform my duties without bias or sentiment i cannot guarantee i will deliver a verdict in your favour
data where else on this planet can i find someone she cannot intimidate
sir i will have to follow the rules of conduct for a ventaxian jurist
i understand youll make a fine judge

a thousand years ago our planet was dying overcrowded and dangerous city states warred unceasingly with each other the air and water were polluted with industrial waste and there was a constant threat of starvation and epidemic
and then what happened
and then you came
objection there is no conclusive evidence that this woman ever visited the planet a thousand years ago
i suppose you want a thousand year old witness
that would be acceptable
jared in the contract does it specify how you would know me when i return
yes by the date
anything else
by the shaking of the cities and by the visions
and all of these occurred on schedule
yes
thank you your honour i submit that i have established my identity as stated by the contract
captain picard my interpretation of ventaxian law suggests under these circumstances this is acceptable your objection is overruled
but your honour
sir i have ruled please sit down you may proceed
thank you your honour now when i first set foot on ventax two what did i offer your people
according to the scrolls you offered us a thousand years of peace and prosperity if we would promise to surrender ourselves to you at the end of the term
now why do you think they would strike such a bargain
we had nothing to lose there was no hope in sight
until i came along
objection
i withdraw the observation no further questions
your honour nothing in this testament proves that ardra had the power to affect the lives of the ventaxians my opponent has failed to prove her case and i move that her claim be summarily dismissed
i find no cause to invalidate the contract at this time the arbitration will continue
your honour captain picard as a new visitor to my planet has been a consistent doubter of my abilities i would like to ask him a few questions if i may
it is highly irregular to question the opposing advocate but i see no reason to deny it proceed
please dont take any offence at these questions you know how fond i am of you
objection
sustained the advocate will refrain from expressing personal affections for her opponent
you do not believe my powers are real do you
no i dont
then sir may i ask you to explain this

you are out of order
or this

the advocate will refrain from making her opponent disappear

or this

can you explain it picard
any more disruptions and i will rule you in contempt of court is that understood
i am sorry your honour but can you explain it picard yes or no
no
i rest my case your honour

the decay rate of these zparticles makes it almost impossible to trace the source
im correlating particle trajectories theyre beginning to align wait a minute i have coordinates thirty four degrees north sixty two degrees east at an altitude of two hundred ten kilometres
that would put it in orbit above the western magnetic pole running visual scan nothing
this time i dont buy the magic somethings got to be there

jared youve described quite thoroughly the history of your people before and after ardras first visit but i am a little unclear about the change itself did ardra simply snap her fingers and transform the planet into this paradise
no the changes occurred gradually over a long period of time
did she personally form the government that so peacefully ruled this planet for a millennium
no historical records indicate a council was convened to assess our options they drew up a new constitution which the population later ratified
i see so she advised this council
no
no then she must have destroyed all the weapons on the planet
no our leaders did that and they signed a treaty of nonaggression
well then lets move on to the environmental gains on ventax two how were those accomplished
we shifted our economy from an industrial to an agrarian base it was more ecologically sound
but ardra must have purified the polluted water and air
no the record shows there were a series of initiatives covering everything from atmospheric contaminants to waste disposal
did she not even pick up one piece of trash
ardra had left ventax two before the environmental reforms began
forgive me but it sounds as if with a great deal of hard work and courage your ancestors changed this world all by themselves
objection the advocate is drawing conclusions
sustained i will draw my own conclusions if you do not mind sir
no further questions
rebuttal
just two questions is there any doubt in your mind any doubt at all that if i had not intervened the terrible conditions here would have continued i remind you that youre under oath
no doubt at all
then as former head of state for the ventaxian people you are satisfied that i fulfilled my part of the bargain
yes ardra
thank you your honour what more can be said both sides agree the terms of the contract have been fulfilled
captain picard do you have any further evidence to present before i render judgment

i believe my associate mister la forge may be bringing the answer to that question i request a recess
hi data
geordi one hour recess is granted

mister la forge my reputation as a litigator not to mention my immortal soul is in serious jeopardy
well whatevers been going on over here gave us exactly what we needed
have you identified the source of her power
a cloaked ship
she has a romulan cloaking device
more likely a bad copy of one we picked it up through a wavelength stretchout
the enterprise
exactly where its supposed to be ardra extended her cloaking shields around it set up a subspace damping field to interfere with normal operations ive isolated the frequency spread and penetrated the field
can you make contact
already have
this is what i want to do but we have less than an hour

jared youre a wise and experienced leader and i assume you trust your senses
yes i would say so
and all your senses tell you that this woman here is the most powerful force on this planet dont they
yes
then what would you say if i were to tell you that she has no powers whatsoever
but we have seen her powers here
thats right and you will again
oh yes ardras magic jared would you believe me if i told you that i could steal her powers and perform the same magical acts as she
im sorry captain picard but you are not ardra
no thats true im not ardra but i can create tremors just as she did

objection your honour
i think he deserves some leeway overruled but that will be quite enough captain
of course ardra will you would do the honours and stop the tremors
er of course
is something the matter
i like the tremors
well i dont

you recognise the old bag of tricks what about this one  come back ardra if you can no fine allow me

of all the impudence
impudence
impudence is pretending to be feklhr of klingon
your leeway has run out captain
your honour i appreciate your indulgence allow me to explain a team from the enterprise has taken control of this womans ship now in orbit around ventax two thank you for your help number one
glad to be of service sir
they have been monitoring me on my communicator executing a prearranged programme on her ships computer a fairly ingenious combination of forcefield projection holography and transporter effects ardra controls her magic literally by the blink of an eye centuries old technology an implant which permits the movements of her eye to choose and activate each illusion ardra once told us that she is known by many names well at least in that she was being honest her crew has admitted that she is known by twenty three aliases in this sector alone
you had no right
deceiving innocent people with her petty schemes for years ventax two must have offered her the greatest opportunity of her nefarious career she learned of the myth of ardra studied it and expertly played on your fears that your people were ready to virtually surrender to her
your honour under the circumstances i believe it is only fair that i release the ventaxians from their obligation and i will let them keep the peace they have and i will just be on my way

with the advocates withdrawal the contract is hereby dissolved this arbitration is adjourned
thank you captain picard you saved our lives
no jared as ive tried to tell you you saved your own lives a long time ago
congratulations sir
your honour
you would have had a lot more fun if youd lost till we meet again jeanluc picard of the starship enterprise
clues

captains log stardate  early completion of our mission at harrakis five has allowed me to grant extra personal time for many of the crew this has come as something of a relief since our recent tight scheduling has prevented pursuit of the leisure activities that are a normal part of life aboard the enterprise i expect our journey past the ngame nebula to be uneventful and am personally using the time to fulfill a promise to a colleague

dixon hill around
hes occupied at the present moment
tell him glorias here
cant do that he doesnt want to be disturbed
tell him its gloria from cleveland
doesnt matter if youre from the moon hon mister hill is incommuni incommunica ka
incommunicado
thats it sorry hon
look hon just tell him glorias here
look when the boss doesnt want to be disturbed the boss doesnt want to be disturbed dont take it personal like
i have an appointment with mister hill at two oclock
its two ten
so i had a little trouble getting into the dress it took me a little while to figure out exactly what i was supposed to do with these 
sorry dix theres a lady here to see you says her name is
gloria
gloria
from cleveland
from cleveland okay he never heard of you
hes never heard of me
thats right
oh wait i think you dont understand you see this was all been set up in advance you see im supposed to be gloria from cleveland and i was supposed to be on holodeck number four at two oclock and you dont have any idea what im talking about do you not to worry
hey you cant go in there


get inside close the door whos the doll
shes a the dolls my cousin
yeah gloria from cleveland
im sorry about this gu gloria i didnt actually mean you to get involved she knows nothing about this johnny

what does that mean oh i see
yeah right what do i look like a jamoke you aint nobodys cousin and you aint here for a visit what do you know about my money
your money
the money he stole
you stole his money
dont listen to him gloria hes lying
johnny johnny talk to me johnny im a great listener
im finished with talking sweetheart now im going to get some action or else

this is what you do for fun
its a mystery who was this man who killed him wheres the money he was talking about its a mystery now we have to go search for clues
ah and thats fun

thats fun a forty eight packard with white walls damn it i couldnt get the license plate
captain picard sorry theres no captain picard here you should try down at the docks ships come
its all right madeline ill take it in here

yes what is it
captain lieutenant commander data here please excuse the unusual interruption but under the circumstances i thought that patching communications through the holodeck programme would be less obtrusive
i appreciate your concern commander data what can i do for you

long range sensors detect a ttauri type star within a pocket of the ngame cloud

well theres nothing unusual about that

no sir however the stars single planet falls within the mclass range it is capable of supporting life

that is unusual
highly sir
well thank you mister data procedures require that we investigate recall the bridge crew and set in a course
aye sir
im sorry gloria but there is a twentyfourth century mystery i have to investigate you are very welcome to carry on if you like
no ive had enough fun for today

 entering the ttauri system now captain
sensors indicate an energy fluctuation directly in our path source unknown
still picking up energy distortions but fading it seems to be gone
a wormhole
very likely small and extremely unstable wormholes have been mapped near thirty nine ttauri systems in the last one hundred years alone sir
captain i suggest we move to a safer location it could reappear at any moment
agreed number one ensign take us a course
captain

captain
data
careful captain the stun effect from the wormhole was relatively severe
apparently so how long were we unconscious
approximately thirty seconds i have scanned the entire ship and detected no lifethreatening injuries among the crew
you were not affected
no sir my positronic system is immune to the effect this is the third unstable wormhole i have passed through during my time with starfleet the first was aboard the uss trieste
thank you mister data well where the hell are we
point five four parsecs from our original position almost a days travel in just thirty seconds
sir i should realign the ships clock with starbase four tens subspace signal to adjust for the time distortion
proceed
yes captain
captain this is crusher in sickbay
go ahead doctor
im getting scattered reports

of minor injuries whats happened
the enterprise just jumped through a wormhole

apparently we were all unconscious for about thirty seconds
is everybody all right there
theres little or no damage on the bridge doctor

acknowledged crusher out

ships status
reports coming in now nothing serious so far
la forge here captain ive checked impulse engines and warp drives sir they appear to be unaffected
shields and weapons systems are fully functional
counsellor are you all right
i think so im feeling a bit unfocused itll pass
well not too bad all things considered
were lucky we didnt end up half way across the galaxy in the middle of next week
that was never actually a possibility the wormholes small size and relatively short period would make this a local phenomenon
theres still the anomalous mclass planet we were going to investigate do we go back
the unpredictability of the wormhole would make an investigation a hazardous one a probe launched from our current position would be more advisable
make it so


nothing broken chief but the ligaments around the elbow have been twisted pretty severely what on earth were you doing when you fell
hanging a plant for keiko its part of her running project to give me a green thumb
hows it working
everything i touch seems to turn brown and wither away
alyssa would you get me oh never mind ill get it you dont go away


this isnt possible

alyssa
yes doctor
did you see anybody near the lab today
no i didnt
you didnt by chance adjust the environments on the incubation containers
i would never touch one of your experiments unless you asked me to doctor
of course not im sorry alyssa thank you

probe approaching the ttauri system captain
readings data
coming in now sir the probe is within visual range of the planet
on screen

sensors indicate a hydrogenhelium composition with a frozen helium core
wait a minute didnt your readings indicate a class m planet before we passed through the wormhole data
it is possible the sensors were affected by interference from the wormhole commander it is clearly not a class m planet
mister data run a full diagnostic to make sure the wormhole didnt permanently damage the sensors
aye sir
ensign take us back on a course
captain
problem number one
it seems awfully strange that a malfunctioning sensor would give such a specific misreading of a planet i would have thought that a timespace disturbance would have caused a lot more confusion than that
it is conceivable that the sensors picked up the afterimage of an actual planet on the other side of the wormhole we could survey the nearby stars for such a planet it would require approximately six days sir
no no we dont have time for that weve encountered a minor mystery one that has been solved to my satisfaction number one unless theres a major objection then ensign mcknight should put us back on course for evadne four
no objection
ensign
aye sir

come

i have something of a minor mystery on my hands
a minor mystery that seems to be a recurring phrase these days oh diomedian scarlet moss i didnt know you were an enthnobotanist
its a hobby
youve got a good crop here as i recall its not easy to cultivate
thats just it i started these spores right before we were all knocked unconscious by the wormhole you said we were unconscious for thirty seconds
correct
then why do these show a full days growth
perhaps youve got some sort of fast growth strain
each of these incubators was set with spores from completely different sources in the diomedian system i have a dozen more in the lab perhaps something extraordinary happened to one of them but not to all of them
doctor we were not unconscious for a full day everything on board indicates that we were out for thirty seconds the ships chronometer the computer everything doctor including commander data
jeanluc im telling you this is over twenty four hours of growth
captains log supplemental commander data continues to maintain that we were unconscious for only thirty seconds despite doctor crushers evidence to the contrary

captain i have a hypothesis the twentysecond century physicist pell underhill conjectured that a major disruption in time continuity could be compensated for by trillions of counter reactions that effect may have allowed doctor crushers mosses to arrive at the other side of the worm hole with the unanticipated growth
underhill was talking about energy
true nevertheless it is possible that the phenomenon could occur in matter at much higher levels of organisation given the proper conditions
thank you data an intriguing hypothesis well perhaps weve got a tempest in a test tube after all
captain
data i promised mister nelson that you would assist him with the sensor diagnostic youll find him hard at work on deck thirty six
as you wish captain

do you believe him i want a frank answer commander
not for a second im amazed that he even proposed it
what are you suggesting captain
im not sure mister worf i have never known data to tell a lie and yet
if we never went through that wormhole then what happened to us during that day
if we were out for a whole day why didnt our beards grow
whatever it was it seems something data doesnt want to tell us about
it could be that whatever caused this situation also affected data and it could be that hes telling the truth and that this is all just a minor mystery
we could always check the computers chronometer see if theres any evidence of tampering
a transporter trace analysis might give us another indication of how much time has actually passed
doctor commander make it so meanwhile we will maintain our present course if there is something wrong with data we dont want him to be aware of our suspicions

gentlemen how goes the battle
the long range and infrared sensors apparently suffered ill effects as a result of the wormhole we are presently checking neutrino and heavy particle detectors
great ill take over now data the captain wants you back on the bridge see you later in ten forward

nelson i need your help with the computer

hello chief hows the elbow
much better thanks this isnt a house call is it
no its not tell me do you remember the last person to use the transporter before we went through the wormhole
let me check ensign locklin shes one of my technicians
tell her to report to sickbay immediately

electrolyte concentration
twelve point five deviation from previous
interesting check the cellular membranes im willing to bet the internal turgid pressure is off by almost the same amount
eleven three deviation from the norm
terrific thats what i wanted to hear thank you ensign locklin thatll be all for now

crusher to captain picard
what is it doctor
i need to see you immediately
im on my way to engineering join me

physiologically each of us is on a daily cycle our cells have developed rhythms based on a twentyfour hour period
the internal clock
exactly and i can measure that effect at the molecular level i took a trace from the last person to use the transporter before the incident and compared her cell function levels at that time to what they are right now if we were unconscious for only thirty seconds those cycles should be nearly synchronous
and were they
no we were out for longer than thirty seconds captain a lot longer

ive got some good news and some bad news the good news is that we were right about the computers chronometer theres a security programme to prevent tampering but it looks now like it was disabled and a new programme put in its place someone has reset the clock
if thats the good news whats the bad news
that data and i are the only ones aboard this ship capable of doing it

it is a mystery captain
that is an understatement data is it possible that someone or something could have affected you without your knowing
i am unable to answer that question sir
data would you consent to being examined by commander la forge
as you wish captain
will you escort commander data to engineering
i know the way sir

captains log supplemental it has become clear that everyone aboard the enterprise has lost an entire day as the mystery of what actually occurred during those missing hours continues to deepen so do my doubts about commander data

well start with the higher functions before we get down to basics okay all right now this wont hurt a bit

have you forgotten geordi that my sensory inputs are not programmed to experience pain
a figure of speech bedside manner im just trying to make you feel comfortable
i am perfectly comfortable
pattern recognition syntactic algorithms heuristic functions all normal
i have noticed however that you appear a bit uncomfortable yourself
it just seems like youre not being completely honest with us data im your friend if theres something wrong i want you to tell me maybe i can help
i cannot tell you anything beyond what i have already stated
okay

excuse us counsellor captain i finished examining data
and
nothings wrong with the technology that i can see hes in perfect condition
i was almost hoping that youd find a problem
he still could be malfunctioning beyond my ability to detect it
this entire mystery started when our sensors detected that planet first it was classm now it isnt
but our sensors were malfunctioning our probe clearly established the planet could not support life
data launched that probe
if he rigged it could you prove it
i could try
what happened to us in that missing day surely there must be some clues each of us should try and think what we were doing just before we blacked out reenact it if you have to

counsellor
deanna are you all right
just a moment yes yes im fine
what happened
i suddenly became dizzy id think id better go to my quarters
perhaps sickbay would be a better idea
no no really im all right
will you see the counsellor to her quarters
aye sir

thank you for coming with me mister worf
you are certain you are well
i just need some rest thanks

deanna security override the lock on counsellor trois quarters now

whats wrong
the mirror i came in here i looked into the mirror it wasnt me worf it wasnt me it was my face but it wasnt me inside

is she all right
i feel fine now
signs of stress adrenaline byproducts higher than baseline but thats a normal reaction after sudden fright all brain functions check out okay
what happened deanna
it wasnt what i saw it was more what i felt i looked into the mirror and it seemed a stranger was staring back at me from behind my own eyes as if my face was a mask
la forge to captain picard

go ahead geordi
ive found something sir
im on my way

lieutenant worf
doctor
can i help you
perhaps not
worf you came in here for something
a warrior does not complain about physical discomfort but the captain ordered us to report anything out of the ordinary

are you in pain  how did this happen

do you recognize this planet data
yes sir it is the planet our probe detected in the ttauri system
no its not actually its tethys three i retrieved this image from the ships library its geophysical figures have been slightly altered but its definitely tethys three
strange that an obscure planet several hundred light years from here should be picked up by the probe data did you take this image from the ships library and programme the probe to send it back to us
i cannot verify that hypothesis
but you dont deny it
no sir
mister la forge will you send another probe to the ttauri system
yes sir im sorry data

counsellor troi just had a very disturbing hallucination
is she all right sir
for the moment can you tell me if deannas incident is related in any way to this missing time period
no sir i cannot
data youre the key to this entire mystery and youve done nothing but block my every attempt to solve it why are you fighting me
it is not by choice
what do you mean by that
i cannot say
would you rather endanger deanna a friend and a colleague than tell me what is going on
which would you place first the welfare of a single individual or that of the entire crew
are you saying that by not cooperating you are actually protecting us
i am not saying that at all i merely state a possible alternative explanation
then mister data im going to ask you again and i order you to directly answer me what really happened to us
i cannot answer that
what would you have me do data how would you handle this if our positions were reversed
i am apparently guilty of falsifying the enterprises records of interfering with an investigation of disobeying a direct order from my commanding officer your duty seems clear sir
do you know what a court martial would mean your career in starfleet would be finished
i realise that sir
do you also realise that you would most likely be stripped down to your wires to find out what the hell has gone wrong
yes sir i do

this wrist has been broken broken and reset and treated with one of our subcutaneous bone fusion units
during the missing day
thats the only possibility
are you suggesting he was conscious
im suggesting that maybe we all were i certainly didnt repair a broken wrist while i was unconscious
and our memories of that day
blocked possibly erased
by whom
there are very few individuals on board who could have broken my wrist commander data is one of those individuals
i cant accept that explanation
well he does possess the speed and the strength
granted but im beginning to suspect that commander data is refusing to cooperate because he believes he is acting in the best interests of the enterprise
la forge to captain picard
go ahead geordi
our probe is approaching the planet sir
acknowledged maybe now well get some answers

what do you have mister la forge
visuals available now captain
mclass nickeliron core nitrogenoxygen atmosphere
the same planet our sensors picked up before the socalled wormhole
affirmative
no indication of any spacetime distortion whatsoever the probe should at least be detecting some residual effect even if the wormhole is inactive
thats because there is no a wormhole there never was
sir
it was a ruse designed to throw us off the track look at the clues doctor crushers incubation experiment the computer clock the transporter trace all indicate the existence of a missing day lieutenant worfs broken wrist would seem to suggest that we were awake and aware for that day possibly in a struggle for our lives
the fact that were still alive suggests we might have won
not necessarily doctor datas behaviour would seem to suggest we did not why else would he be willing to sacrifice his career rather than tell the truth
if we didnt win and we didnt lose
then the only alternative would be a stalemate maybe a compromise might have been reached a compromise that forced data into this silence
maybe by uncovering all this we run the risk of upsetting the stalemate maybe we should leave well enough alone
possibly number one and i would be prepared to live with the mystery but datas role in this must be ascertained or hell never be trusted with starship duty again ensign take us back to the scene of the crime the ttauri system warp two

within sensor range captain
drop to impulse ensign mister worf maximum shields ready all weapons
shields up photon torpedoes armed phasers standing by captain an energy field has appeared between our position and the planet
on screen  hold position lets see what it does
the field has emitted an energy pulse approaching the enterprise
too slow to be a photon torpedo
it might be a probe
lets see what happens when it hits the shields
shields undamaged the energy pulse has dispersed


counsellor troi what is it

the plan has failed
you have returned
your ship is again in our space
i was unable to prevent it
nevertheless you are here
the enterprise is not a threat to you give me more time our destruction would only

data captain wanted me to bring you to the bridge counsellor
one moment if you would

do nothing it may yet be possible to salvage the situation

reporting as ordered captain
well data as you can see were back where it all started
we must leave immediately sir
why
any further delay would put us all at grave risk
why what is the source of that risk the energy field
i cannot say
data you sound as if youre stuck in a feedback loop you certainly can say you have free will you have a choice
my silence is not by choice sir
not by choice are you somehow being controlled by that force did geordi miss something when he examined you
geordis examination was exemplary
then why are you compelled to disobey my orders how during the missing day were you contacted by starfleet did they order you to conceal the truth from us
i cannot answer that we must leave sir
this ship isnt going anywhere not until i get an answer now who gave you that order

you did sir
i ordered you to lie
captain the energy field is approaching
maintain shields at full intensity
no we must vary shield shape and strength as rapidly as possible maximum shields will only speed the ships takeover
contact imminent
do as data says at once
aye sir the field is shifting amplitude trying to match the shields
the energy field will eventually penetrate our shields there is no way to counter the paxans technology we can delay their takeover but we cannot prevent it
the paxans who are they
you have invaded our system

no worf
you will only harm counsellor trois body
we are not invaders we are explorers
your knowledge of us is unacceptable
they are xenophobes sir isolationists the paxans terraformed a protoplanet in this system in order to better conceal their whereabouts the apparent wormhole we experienced is actually a trap designed to keep out invaders the energy field stuns everyone on board the invading vessel and places them in a state of biochemical stasis
that explains why our beards didnt grow
the paxans then take the ship out of their territory
so the crew wakes up and thinks theyve been through a wormhole count their blessings and keep going
precisely
what went wrong this time
my positronic brain is a technology unknown to the paxans
our stun field had no effect on him he remained conscious while we tried to take over the ship
when i realised the crew was incapacitated i initiated emergency procedures

computer engage emergency plan zed zed alpha
automatic defense procedures initiated energy field strength increasing warning shield penetration seventeen percent
computer begin random fluctuation of shield frequency and modulation
executed
with the enterprise temporarily protected i revived the crew
computer release compound adth into the airflow system five parts per million
acknowledged initiating compound release now

status data
the energy field is attempting to match shield frequencies sir
options mister worf
i do not recommend weapons at this range captain
can we go to warp
negative sir the field is also acting as a tractor beam

warning shields have been penetrated
all systems are frozen captain
the paxans can manipulate energy structures on many levels they took control of counsellor trois body to communicate with us

captain

no stop everyone who are you
you are aware of our existence our attempt to place you in biochemical stasis has failed we have no choice but to destroy this ship
if you destroy this ship then others will come in search of us you may not be able to stop them all knowledge of your civilisation would be spread across half the galaxy
no
allow us safe passage and i will protect your right to privacy to the best of my ability we will never tell anyone of your existence
there are over a thousand lifeforms on this vessel how could you assure their silence
this biochemical stasis does it suppress synaptic functions
it does
then you must have the capability of affecting memory can you erase the shortterm memory of everyone on this ship remove all knowledge of this event allow us to proceed as if it had never happened
it would take time one of your days he is immune to our influence
data im going to give you a most unusual order im not sure that you will be able to integrate it into your programme
as a starfleet officer i am required to follow all of your orders captain
good because our survival depends upon it i am ordering you never to reveal what has happened here today not to starfleet not to myself you will conceal your knowledge of the paxans for as long as you exist do you fully understood data
completely sir
satisfactory
agreed
good now our task is to eliminate from the ships records any information that might lead to knowledge of this incident lets get to work

we proceeded to erase all evidence of our encounter with the paxans i reset the computers chronometer and the crew was again stunned into unconsciousness their shortterm memories erased when they were revived a day later the computer adjustments made it appear that only thirty seconds had passed
and here we are
here we are again
your plan has failed this ship must be destroyed
no wait the plan failed because clues were left behind that suggested a mystery and to many humans a mystery is irresistible it must be solved the doctors incubation experiment worfs wrist trois hallucinations little pieces of evidence that suggested even more clues the clock the transporter trace datas odd behaviour if we eliminate the clues and begin again
again
yes consider the first time a runthrough a rehearsal to shake out the flaws the second time will succeed if we leave no clues
you are a most unusual species worthy of a second chance proceed

deanna
welcome back counsellor geordi data reconfigure the computer and the records number one i want you to oversee the rest of the ship and this time lets get it right

what happened data
the effect from the wormhole was rather intense
so it would seem
everyone but myself was rendered unconscious my positronic system is immune to the effect
how long were we out
thirty seconds sir
current position
point five four parsecs from our previous position bearing two eight five mark one four seven
it could be worse
yes sir the wormhole appears to have been a local phenomenon
crusher to bridge what happened captain
the enterprise went through a wormhole doctor it seems the entire crew was unconscious for approximately thirty seconds
is anyone on the bridge hurt
apparently not
ill start checking the other decks crusher out
status reports
shields and weapons systems unaffected
no damage in engineering
counsellor
theres a general feeling of disorientation on board but nothing serious as far as i can tell
well then theres still that anomalous classm planet we were going to investigate ensign replot a course to take us back to
sir it is likely the anomalous readings were the result of the wormholes effect it was extremely unstable i would recommend against returning it might put the enterprise at further risk
we could launch a probe
that would certainly be sufficient sir
make it so and put out a hazard advisory to starfleet ensign set a course to evadne four
aye sir
engage
first contact



watch the door careful he may have suffered cranial damage
move him onto the diagnostic pad
right
slowly
right here we go

slowly thats good
all right careful

readings
theyre fluctuating sir
he took a severe blow possible trauma to the telencephalon
start fifteen octares of quadroline well need a complete delscan series
i cant find his cardial organ
what do you mean im reading a steady circulation
there it is up here
in his digestive tract
ever seen anything like this

hes missing three costal struts on one side and four on the other
you think thats something look at this

he has digits on his terminus

what are you



what happened
youre in the crisis room at the sikla medical facility youve had a severe injury but youre going to be all right
i was caught in the riots when the police moved in its the last thing i remember
can you tell us your name
rivas rivas jakara
rivas jakara where do you live
in the marta community on the southern continent
youre a long way from home do you have any members of your family we should notify
no i have no family i cant stay here i have to get back
youre in no condition to leave yet there are several unusual things about your case mister jakara your cranial lobes for instance they seem to be surgical implants
i had cosmetic surgery to correct a genetic birth defect
and these  another birth defect
yes isnt that something my fathers were the same way
you want us to believe that all your abnormalities are inherited genetic traits
i understand your confusion my personal physician is much more familiar with these genetic irregularities to be honest i would much feel better back home under her care
why dont i talk to her about that whats her name
crusher actually im not sure youll be able to reach her
why not
shes taking a sabbatical
well well do the best we can for you oh there was one other thing we found this curiouslooking device in your clothes what is it

its just a toy i was taking home as a present
i thought you didnt have any family
its for a neighbours child was there anything else found i had one piece of jewelry a metal pin
no im sorry this was all we found

genetic irregularities that thing isnt even the same species as we are
keep your voice down the last thing we need is a panic in here over some
its all the space flights they have attracted creatures from outer space
thats exactly the kind of thing i dont want to hear
what are you going to do
of all the medical facilities available why did he have to end up here
i think we ought to call central security
well im not calling anybody yet not till weve done a lot more a lot more i want his story checked out run a complete search through the medical library be absolutely certain theres never been anything like him
what if therere more of them they could be everywhere
cordon off the wing i want security on his door twenty nine hours a day and i want this kept quiet
code three drill in b wing all instructors report immediately


at twelve point four after launch the warp field generator will be activated
thats when it would break the light barrier
yes chancellor if were successful the craft will leave our star system and in a matter of minutes will be on its way to the garth system
and then what
and then krola well see whats there
how long mirasta
we have the prototype design for the warp engine it would simply be a matter of building the actual production units if i get your approval today ten months maybe less
chancellor ill admit mirastas enthusiasm for her work is seductive but perhaps were moving too fast your opponents will see this as another example of your determination to pull us further from our traditional ways
my opponents look back as i look forward i cannot believe that my people would choose to retreat after all weve done
i agree
the people were willing to accept your social reforms because they believe in you chancellor but there are many who say we have gone far enough all these new ideas new technology and now space travel it confuses them frightens them
i will not allow them to remain in the dark ages the warp programme will proceed as you have outlined mirasta and then we will slow down krola to let everyone catch their breath including you


mirasta yale
yes
please dont be alarmed at our appearance
my name is jeanluc picard this is my associate deanna troi
what are you
weve come with some important information
about what
about space about the universe you are preparing to enter
we come from a federation of planets captain picard is from a planet called earth which is over two thousand light years from here im from another planet called betazed
weve been monitoring your progress toward warpdrive capability when a society reaches your level of technology and is clearly about to initiate warp travel we feel the time is right for first contact we prefer meeting like this rather than a random confrontation in deep space
weve come to you first because youre a leader in the scientific community scientists generally accept our arrival more easily than others
we almost always encounter shock and fear on this sort of mission we hope that you will help us facilitate our introduction
is this a joke did lupo and the others from the lab put you up to this
its certainly no joke as you can see we are physically quite different from malcorians and with your permission im prepared to prove it to you
i would like that
picard to enterprise three to beam up


its everything ive ever dreamed of when i was a child my parents would take me to the planetarium and we would sit in the dark and it was as if i was on a spaceship on my way to another world to meet people on other planets part of me keeps waiting for the lights to come up and the programme to end how did you know about me
we learn as much as possible about a planet before we make first contact
one of the things we monitor are your broadcast signals your journalism your music your humour try to better understand you as a people
i hate to think how you would judge us based on our popular music and entertainment
indeed we do get an incomplete picture which is why we also do surface reconnaissance
youve had people on our planet
for several years
these are specialists highly trained observation teams superficially identical to yourselves and therefore able to blend naturally into your society you see we have discovered that the most hazardous aspect of these missions is a lack of sufficient information
you dont have to explain i understand although not everybody on my planet would they would think you were trying to infiltrate our society
there is a difficulty here one that has forced us to accelerate this entire process one of our people is missing my first officer commander william riker he was down on the planet surface coordinating with the observation team the final details of contact he disappeared my people have made enquiries but theyve not been able to locate him if there is anything you can help
of course where was rikers last known location
the capital city he was under the name of rivas jakara a tourist from the marta community
we must find him before someone realises what he really is if this gets out prematurely it could seriously complicate matters our ideology is based on the assumption that the malcorian is a supreme lifeform and our world is the centre of the universe your arrival will change our entire understanding of life and some will not want it to change
what about durken
durken he will be openminded but cautious i strongly suggest that you do not discuss your surveillance teams with him at least not right away
but with the disappearance of commander riker wouldnt it be prudent
captain picard i must ask you to trust me on this if you tell the chancellor about commander riker you will undermine everything that you hope to accomplish here durken will assign krola our minister of security to find him krola has his own political agenda he will perceive you as the greatest threat that our people have ever known and he will not hesitate to use riker to prove that he is correct


from another planet hundreds of them
it doesnt make sense that hes the only one think about it
i thought i said this was to be kept a secret
you know nilrem
well its getting out of control i dont know what else he is but he is still a patient in this medical facility and we have a responsibility for his care and recovery remind them of that will you
youre not going to be able to contain this much longer
i know
if people get scared enough anything could happen

mister jakara we have been unable to confirm anything you told us no physician named crusher is on file not on this planet your address in martas an eating establishment the cook has never heard of rivas jakara
obviously theres been some misunderstanding
theres a growing number of people on the other side of that door who believe you are not one of us mister jakara
not one of you
that you are from another planet are you mister jakara
do you realise what youre saying
i know how it sounds im not anxious to make a fool of myself this new era of space flight it fires the imagination people see unidentified vessels in the sky that turn out to be weather balloons
well its far more likely that i am a weather balloon than an alien
our medical journals have documented several cases of genetic mutation in recent history some unusual physical disfigurations have occurred
im another case for the medical journals then
perhaps but you mister jakara are hiding something and unless you tell me the truth about yourself this rumour will persist and grow and could even become dangerous most especially to you


chancellor minister yale of the space bureau would like to introduce you to someone
call her back see if the vicechancellor will do
theyre out here waiting to see you sir
all right send them in

always time to meet your friends mirasta
chancellor i think you might want to clear your afternoon schedule for this


and this is the bridge
chancellor

here we have environmental and engineering stations mission operations and the two principal science stations
data allow me to introduce chancellor avel durken and space administrator mirasta yale
chancellor minister
commander data is my second officer
hes an android chancellor a constructed being
a machine
in a manner of speaking the term artificial lifeform would be more accurate
captain picard is there someplace we might speak together without distraction
certainly
chancellor with your permission i would like to beam to the surface i have several matters to attend to
not a word to anyone about this mirasta
of course
mister data will you escort the minister to the transporter room chancellor

has there still been no communication from commander riker data
no minister he has not returned to our designated transport coordinates we have continued to scan the capital city without success


ive been saving this for a special occasion my brother on earth produces fruit known as grapes which he turns into wine hes really quite good at it chancellor we have a tradition called a toast it is a drink to salute ones friends and good fortune and i would like to propose a toast to a new friendship
we have something very much like this here on malcor three
i think we shall find we have much in common
and much that is not in common
an opportunity to learn from one another
you speak the language of diplomacy very well captain it is a language i appreciate and understand but i have learned to not always trust it
trust requires time and experience
my worlds history has recorded that conquerors often arrived with the words we are your friends
we are not here as conquerors chancellor
what do you want
a beginning but how we proceed is entirely up to you
and if my wishes should conflict with yours
therell be no conflict
and if i should tell you to leave and never return to my world
we will leave and never return chancellor we are here only to help guide you into a new era i can assure you we will not interfere in the natural development of your planet that is in fact our prime directive
i can infer from that directive that you do not intend to share all this exceptional technology with us
that is not the whole meaning but it is part of it
is this your way of maintaining superiority
chancellor to instantly transform a society with technology would be harmful and it would be destructive
youre right of course im overwhelmed captain picard im quite overwhelmed i go home each night to a loving wife two beautiful daughters we eat the evening meal together as a family i think thats important and they always ask me if ive had a good day
and how shall you answer them tonight chancellor
i will have to say this morning i was the leader of the universe as i knew it this afternoon i am only a voice in a chorus but i think it was a good day


there are guards out there youll never escape that way im not afraid of you
good because theres nothing to be afraid of
we shouldnt fear the unknown we should embrace it
can you help me get out of here
are you really an alien its all right to tell me
no im not an alien
i dont believe you you are an alien
i really have to leave
i could divert the guards attention you might stand a chance if you took the service exit down the hallway to the right
to the right fine lets do it
why should i
well you know why i dont belong here i have to get back on my ship in space
i believe you
now will you help me
if you make love to me
what
ive always wanted to make love with an alien
listen miss
lanel
lanel i really have to get going all the other aliens are waiting for me
oh its not so much to ask and then ill help you escape
its not that easy there are differences in the way that my people make love
i cant wait to learn

but its
its your only way out of here my alien


somethings happened to him i think hes dead go on get some help

okay no that way
thanks
will i ever see you again
ill call you the next time i pass through your star system

stop him somebody stop him
hold it
hes escaping the aliens escaping

stop it all of you stop it now have you all lost your minds
theyve aggravated the injury to his renal organ hes bleeding internally
get him into a surgical cubicle and call central security this has gone too far

their leader picard has made it clear that how we proceed is entirely our own decision
you cannot possibly be suggesting surrender chancellor
they are not hostile
mirasta you are incredibly naive can you be so enraptured with the notion of space travellers that you are blind to the threat they represent
i have seen their vessel krola if they chose to be hostile i do not think we would be standing here now
why should they use force when we are ready to lay down in fear
i do not lay down in fear to them or to you krola
chancellor i mean no disrespect but i have repeatedly warned you about your policies taking us so quickly where we had no business going in the first place new philosophies new economics new technologies there are many people who still value our traditional way of life and i for one am willing to die to defend it
open your eyes krola we are part of a greater community we cannot ignore it
you would ignore them as they infiltrate and spy on us
what are you saying krola
we have captured one of their spies
chancellor he is captain picards first officer commander riker
you knew about this mirasta
he has been missing for two days i told captain picard not to discuss this because i was afraid this is exactly what would happen
what else do you know mirasta everything
they have been on our planet observing for several years
years imagine what they have done influenced our young stirred up dissent
they were collecting information
where is this commander riker now
hes in the sikla medical facility hes recovering from surgery he suffered head injuries in an escape attempt he will recover consciousness in a few hours

will he survive
i didnt think he would have survived the injuries
i have to interrogate him before he dies
at least give him time to regain some strength come back tomorrow
it cannot wait until tomorrow

krola we can get help from his ship with their medical technology he might recover
were not giving him back hes the one advantage we have now use your drugs to revive him
those drugs increase cardial rate and vascular pressure thats the last thing we need to do to him right now
it will probably be enough to kill him you cant do it
revive him
im just a physician minister i dont know much about affairs of state but he is a living intelligent being i dont care if the chancellor himself calls down here i have sworn an oath to do no harm and i will not
then ill find someone to replace you


chancellor
you are punctual captain
i know how busy you are
do you i think you know a great deal more about me than i know about you
in what respect
you speak of trust and peace and working together to enter a new era and at the same time you conduct secret surveillance posing as malcorians
commander riker
commander riker
mirasta said it would be a mistake to discuss this with you
yes shes tried to accept the responsibility
it was my error not hers chancellor there is no starship mission more dangerous than that of first contact we never know what we will face when we open the door on a new world how we will be greeted what exactly the dangers will be centuries ago a disastrous contact with the klingon empire led to decades of war it was decided then we would do surveillance before making contact it was a controversial decision i believe it prevented more problems than it created
i can appreciate the logic of your position captain but it would seem a full disclosure after contact would have been in order
in time there would have been full disclosure i can only ask you to believe that on other worlds it would not be an issue but here everything our observers reported indicated that the people of this world would almost certainly react negatively to our arrival we could see that even surveillance might even be interpreted as an act of aggression i hoped that we would have found commander riker before you did so the matter would not complicate our introduction it was a mistake
yes a mistake i might have made in your place i rather like it actually
like it
that you make mistakes like any man
chancellor i have made some fine ones in my time now i must ask you will you release my officer
well talk again later captain
enterprise one to beam up

yes i understand

i have been relieved of my duties as im sure you already know you are acting director of the facility nilrem

revive him

leave us

i am minister krola of internal security you are riker an alien yes we know
please bring my people here
in time in time but first i need to ask you some questions

thank you for seeing me
if i did not depend so much on your expertise in space matters i would have asked for your resignation
i felt i was acting in the best interests of our people chancellor
when you are selected to occupy this office then you will have the privilege of deciding the best interests of our people picard i can excuse but you mirasta you should have trusted me
chancellor we must release riker to picard any hope for a relationship with these people depends on it
i cant afford to be the idealist you are mirasta
riker
i am prepared to release riker after we have interrogated him
are you prepared for him to die chancellor his injuries are extremely serious a mob at the medical facility almost killed him krola has ordered drugs to be used to revive him for questioning drugs that in his condition would be dangerous for him without medical aid from his ship i believe that riker will not survive the day you must tell picard where he is

you have lied since the moment of your capture and i believe you are lying now commander
no were here on a mission of peace
such noble creatures why do peaceful people develop such lethal weapons or do you still insist its just a toy

an interesting toy to be sure
its only used for defence
perhaps like many conquerors you believe your goals to be benevolent i cannot for however you would describe your intentions you still represent the end to my way of life i cannot permit that to occur eventually durken would choose to welcome your people with arms open and eyes closed i must force him down another path

when they find us i will be dead killed by your weapon the lines will be drawn a peaceful accord will no longer be an option
no
for my people


what happened
he shot him the alien shot krola

get me three octares of adrulmine high frequency em charge unit now
i have a circulation pattern its very weak we have to get him on vital buffers right now

im a physician dont be frightened i need to know what happened are you doctors
yes he shot him
with that thing
crusher to picard
go ahead doctor
commander riker is near death

but theres still some brain activity i need to get him back to the ship
acknowledged
and theres a malconian male with a phaser wound in his upper chest i need to get him back as well
well meet you on the enterprise picard out


theyre both going to be okay we were able to stabilise will if we had been any later
krola
he was never in any real danger the phaser was on stun
stun
its a defensive weapon have you been able to ascertain what happened
based on the angle of impact it suggests that krolas left hand was on the phaser when it went off
they were struggling for the weapon
commander riker was in no position to offer any kind of struggle chancellor
krola was trying to be a martyr
where is this
youre aboard the starship my foolish old friend
no chancellor you must not you must not pursue relations with them you must not
i know i know

but chancellor
mirasta it goes against every instinct in my being my people are not ready to accept what you represent everything that happened in the hospital proves it and krola is the best evidence of all we must slow down and allow all those like him to join us in the present before we can move into the future
but when we encounter other beings in space our people must be ready
the warp programme will have to be delayed we will divert more resources to education and social development to prepare for the day when we are ready
chancellor i strongly disagree
i know captain you once said if i ask you to leave you would without hesitation im afraid i must ask you to do just that
well its your decision chancellor but i must say i regret that i wont have the opportunity of knowing your people better
were a good people captain a society with much potential once we cross the threshold of space we will have to give up this selfimportance this conceit that we are the centre of the universe but this is not the time for that for now we will have to enjoy that sweet innocence
how will you keep us a secret when so many have seen and heard so much
the stories will be told for many years i have no doubt of the ship that made contact of an alien who was held prisoner in the medical facility therell be charges of a government conspiracy some of the witnesses will tell their tales and most people will laugh at them and go back and watch more interesting fiction of the daily broadcasts it will pass
im sorry to say hes probably right captain picard i have one last request take me with you
she will be unhappy with the restrictions i must place on her at home captain
we may not be back here in your lifetime and i have to believe that you cannot be fully prepared for the realities of space travel
i have been prepared for the realities of space since i was nine years old and sitting in a planetarium
mister worf to my ready room

escort chancellor durken to the transporter room lieutenant and assign quarters to minister yale she will be remaining on board
aye sir
until we return then
with luck well both be around to renew our friendship captain
galaxys child

captains log stardate  we are approaching starbase three one three where we will pick up a shipment of scientific equipment for transport to a federation outpost in the guernica system during the journey we will be hosting a special guest

come
you wanted to see me captain
yes mister la forge it seems that the exemplary nature of your work has caught the attention of starfleet command in fact someone is coming on board just to see the engine modifications youve made
who captain
the senior design engineer of the theoretical propulsion group doctor leah brahms
leah is coming here this is terrific
it is
well i mean ive studied her schematics for years she was responsible for a lot of the engine design on the enterprise
well it should be a very enjoyable visit then shell be transporting on board as soon as we reach the starbase would you like to greet her on our behalf
i would love to captain thank you


if you keep picking at that uniform youll wear it out
i guess i am a little nervous its not every day a man comes face to face with his dream
what
you remember about a year ago when we were caught in that booby trap the menthars set okay while we were trying to get out of it i went down to the holodeck to study an engine prototype that was made when the enterprise was first designed and the computer well it gave me an image of the engine but it also created this hologram of the designer doctor leah brahms
so you met a computersimulated female
yeah but not an ordinary computersimulated female i mean she was brilliant of course but warm you know friendly it was like we worked as one i would start a sentences shed finish it what i didnt think of she did it was just so comfortable okay i know it was just a holographic image but the computer was able to incorporate personality traits from her starfleet record
you know geordi everybody falls in love with a fantasy every now and then
no no guinan see youve got it all wrong im not necessarily expecting anything romantic here its just i know whatever leah brahms and i are going to be good friends

doctor brahms is ready to transport sir
okay bring her over

hi i mean welcome aboard doctor brahms im lieutenant commander geordi la forge chief engineer
la forge so youre the one whos fouled up my engine designs



the matterantimatter ratio has been changed the mixture isnt as rich as regulations dictate
experience has shown me that too high a ratio diminishes efficiency i worked with the mixture until i got the right balance
the magnetic plasma transfer to the warp field generators doesnt correspond to the recommended specs
right again i adjusted the flow sometimes things happen a little differently here is space than they do on the drawing board
is that a criticism commander
no of course not its just a well known fact theres theory and theres application they dont always jibe
youve charted a completely new swapout schedule for main components replacement
you bet i found the starfleet estimates for the mtbf units to be unrealistic i simply determined my own schedule based on observation and experience
is that going to be your only defence commander that same tired rhetoric out here in the field we learn things you designers couldnt possibly understand
in the first place doctor im not aware of needing any defence and in the second place if youre determined to be
doctor brahms you have an incoming message on subspace
id like to hear this message privately
in my office be my guest
thank you

commander i am picking up some unusual readings from the alpha omicron system at this range all i am able to discern is that it is an asymmetrical field of intense energy
what type of radiation signature
unknown sir the alpha omicron system is yet to be charted i recommend we take this opportunity for further research
well were way ahead of schedule alter course for alpha omicron

doctor brahms theres no reason for us to argue were on the same side here
im aware of that
so why dont i take you on a little tour show you the adjustments ive made why i think they work and we can begin pulling together on this okay then why not start with the dilithium chamber okay
okay

the anomaly is orbiting the seventh planet sir it is a mass of plasma energy contained within discrete boundaries by an outer covering of silicates actinides and carbonaceous chondrites
on screen magnify is it a ship
it does not conform to any known design
any records of similar phenomena in starfleet listings
none sir this has never been seen before
ensign rager ahead one quarter impulse
aye sir
put us in orbit of the seventh planet keep us at a relative distance of ten kilometres from the object
alert science stations to standby tell them to coordinate all efforts with commander data
aye sir


what happened here who did this
you remember the crystals been reoriented to adjust the direction of the lattice structure
remember why would i remember
right why would you well the ship was experiencing some difficulty and we made this adjustment hoping that it would work and it did
so it was your idea
not exclusively no
its curious this modification was due to be introduced
in the next class starship
yes how did you know
i didnt i mean well its the next logical step right listen doctor sometimes we have to fly by the seat of our pants out here so it stands to reason that once in a while were going to come up with the same solutions you do listen ive got a personnel review scheduled to start in about five minutes and i know its been a long day for you so why dont we get together later sort of plan our agenda for the next day or two
agenda
what it is we want to accomplish here how we might best go about that maybe even get to know each other a little bit it might make this easier
maybe youre right
okay great how about my quarters nineteen hundred hours maybe even have a bite to eat i make a great fungilli
i love fungilli
is that right

sensors are having difficulty penetrating the interior however the radiated output suggests a coherent system of energy storage and utilisation
then it was constructed by someone
it is a possibility however the sensor data gathered thus far suggests a naturally occurring phenomenon with biological properties
a life form
yes captain
mister worf begin compiling readings for transmission to starfleet headquarters mister data prepare to launch three levelfive probes ensign aft thrusters standard observation posture
levelfive probe sequence ready for launch commander on your mark

stand by mister data
aye sir picard what would it be like counsellor no ship no bulky spacesuit just to live between the stars have the entire galaxy as a home

captain we are being probed recommend we raise shields
negative mister worf if we are curious about it it has a perfect right to be curious about us
change in readings sir the life form has increased its energy output by fifty percent
it is moving toward us
reverse course ensign three hundred kph
aye sir
easy we dont want to alarm or provoke it

we are caught in an energy damping field sir
raise shields
no effect captain
reverse power full impulse
impulse engines at full power
no change in position
red alert
mister la forge prepare to initiate warp drive

sorry captain theres too much interference to form a warp field

warning radiation levels at sixty five millirads per minute and rising
riker to doctor crusher
go ahead commander
all decks prepare for radiation protocol
acknowledged crusher out
warning radiation levels at three hundred millirads per minute and rising lethal exposure in one minute
mister worf ready phasers minimum power
ready
fire
radiation levels dropping back to normal captain energy patterns are breaking down sir the radiation signature is no longer stable

energy output is negligible sir radiation patterns no longer coherent i believe it is dead sir
were out here to explore to make contact with other life forms to establish peaceful relations but not to interfere and absolutely not to destroy and yet look what we have just done
captain everything you did was consistent with established starfleet procedures
number one you have the bridge
captain sensors are picking up a new energy reading from the life form
elaborate data
there is a new concentration of ionising radiation growing in the centre of its body
then perhaps its still alive


okay computer subdued lighting no thats too much i dont want it dark i want it cozy
please state your request in precise candlepower
see its not a matter of precision computer its a matter of mood brighter than this more more a little more hold right there perfect now some music maybe a little soft jazz no thats not right let me think here oh i got it some brahms a piano etude nah thats too corny probably everybody thinks of that computer just give me some guitar classical guitar doesnt matter who yes thank you

come on in

oh youve changed
yeah the uniforms are so formal
youre less formal than any starfleet officer ive ever met commander
am i i really just wanted to make you feel more comfortable
im fine thank you
im sorry come in and have a seat can i get you a drink
no thank you
you sure you know your hair its different
different than a few hours ago
no i mean its different than i expected different from your starfleet records
oh yes i used to wear it up
yeah
why would you need to see my personnel file
standard procedure when guests come on board protocol i mean it was nothing specific actually just you know
commander la forge if i seem to be somewhat unyielding in my views its because i care so very much about my work
oh i know
to be honest people find me cold cerebral lacking in humour
but theyre wrong i assure you
well i try not to be that way but when it comes to my designs my engines especially the ones on the enterprise
its like theyre your children
yes exactly
so naturally youre a little possessive about them
you understand that
yes i do you see i feel the same way
thats amazing i dont think anyone has ever sometimes i feel more comfortable with engine schematics than people
well maybe you just havent met the right people you hungry im hungry why dont i just start dinner okay
commander
please call me geordi
im sorry i hope that i didnt put you to a lot of trouble but i cant stay
you cant
i just dont think that its appropriate
oh
ill meet with you at oh eight hundred tomorrow im preparing a list of discrepancies that ive identified in your modifications i hope now that weve reached an understanding that youll be prepared to discuss them with me in a more objective fashion
sure fine
thank you goodnight commander

goodnight

this new concentration of energy was detected only after the surrounding material became inert
could this be some sort of tissue regeneration
the radiation signature is similar to the original pattern but with significant differences
some kind of reaction to our phaser fire perhaps
i believe it is separate and selfcontained within the body of the dead life form
another entity
yes sir it appears to be a smaller less developed version of the original creature
no wonder it attacked us it was about to give birth

doctor
its dangerous to generalise about new life forms but based on my experience with other beings who bear their young in this manner id say that the offspring is still premature otherwise it would be able to break through the outer body shell of the parent
will this creature be able to survive on its own without the parent
theres no way to tell we dont have enough information about the biofunctions of the adult much less the child
is there something we can do to help
if we were in sickbay id try a caesarean section the first priority is to free it from the body of the parent
we could use our phasers as a scalpel
yes that might work
i advise against this captain the parent proved to be a threat to the ship we do not know how the offspring will react
your objection is noted mister worf but we are directly responsible for the death of the parent we cannot simply wash our hands of it now doctor we will proceed at your discretion

good morning
good morning
the first thing id like to do is inspect the power transfer conduits
you realise the only way to inspect them is to crawl inside
i designed them commander i know whats involved


here we go power taps watch yourself
the acoustic signature doesnt sound right
youre probably the only other person in the galaxy who could pick that up
whats causing it
its right up here
ive never seen anything like this before what is it
its a midrange phase adjuster puts the plasma back into phase after inertial distortion
this has never been done before i dont even think this has ever been conceived of before you should write a scientific paper
uhuh doctor no writing is not one of my strong suits
but this kind of refinement should be shared and you deserve the credit for it
well maybe we could collaborate writing is one of your strong points
commander la forge ever since i came on board there seems to be something a little peculiar about your attitude you seem to know things about me even though weve never met
well to tell you the truth ive studied you your writings your starfleet file ive admired you you know your work
well im flattered but
and well i really i really wanted to meet you for a long time and id like to think that we could become friends maybe good friends
i thought you knew i mean you know everything else about me but commander if im hearing what i think im hearing then you should know that im married

set phaser power to three percent narrow beam
three percent
all right here we go

the first incision is complete
ideally the offspring should now be able to push through the outer shell of the parent by itself
i think it needs a little more help
weve done all we can i dont want to risk hitting the offspring by accident
come on you can do it

captain id like to announce the birth of a large baby something
well done doctor well done


how could it have been so far off it was based on every piece of information on record about leah brahms okay with an admitted margin for error but this is an error thats a light year wide
not what you hoped for huh
hoped guinan the woman is about as friendly as a circassian plague cat only cares about her work hates what ive done to her engines and to top it off shes married computer never even told me she was married
computer glitch
must have been
maybe it was your old visor
what are you talking about
the one you wore when you were on the holodeck with her
guinan its the same visor
really oh i figured it was probably the one that lets you see what you want to see
whats that supposed to mean
you saw exactly what you wanted to see in the holodeck sure the computer made it look like her gave it personality but when it came to the relationship la forge you filled in the blanks and you had a perfectly wonderful marvellous little fantasy until the real leah showed up and ruined it shes probably done the most horrific thing one person can do to another not live up to your expectations so id take a good hard long look at her la forge see her for who she is not for what you want her to be

the life forms patterns are stable captain it seems able to withstand the solar radiation
good ensign set course for the guernica system
aye sir
were not staying
no number one weve done all we can to help now its time to move on this creature can continue its existence without any further interference from us
it might be wise to put some distance between us before we initiate warp drive
very well five hundred kph ensign engage
captain it is following us maintaining a distance of four kilometres directly astern
seventeen degrees to port ensign
aye sir
it is turning with us sir
increase to half impulse
it is matching our velocity
its imprinted on us it thinks the enterprise is its mother
a change in energy readings sir i am reading an internal buildup of gamma particles in
its velocity is increasing it is moving directly toward the ship
evasive manoeuvres full

report
minor damage
the creature is now in direct contact with the hull sir
on screen

mister data
sir the life form is draining energy directly from the fusion reactors
its feeding off the energy of the enterprise as it would from its mother
what action should we take sir
none lieutenant none at all
captains log supplemental since the newborn has attached itself to the hull it has been making greater and greater demands on the ships energy but we have been able to stabilise our power systems temporarily

how long before the power drain becomes critical mister la forge
if it continues to increase at the current rate six maybe seven hours
we may be able to modify the engine to extend that a little longer captain
your help would be appreciated doctor
by then junior may not need us any more
mister data is there any way to determine what the destination of the parent might have been
i can attempt to extrapolate from the heading it was on when we encountered it sir
perhaps it was its way to a safe and supportive environment for its newborn
we might be able to deliver it to the same destination
which brings up the question of how do we get junior off the hull once we get there
its almost completely covering the door of shuttlebay two if we open the door and deactivate the atmospheric force field
the pressure from inside the ship might push it away from the hull
make it so
sir is the appellation junior to be the life forms official name
no it is not

we can save a lot of energy just by improving engine efficiency
weve run into similar problems before thats actually why i reoriented the dilithium crystal
and why you added the midrange phase adjusters
right
commander it seems that youve made a lot more modifications than im aware of do you have a file on all the work youve done
its in the computer
picard to la forge
la forge here
commander i need to see you on the bridge
on my way captain you go on ahead doctor ensign palvik can show you the file on the engine modifications

phase coils upgraded to fifty five field densities plasma inducers interlinked with generator ensign would there be any other files with data on the original engine specifications
 i believe so doctor

this file utilises the prototype engine schematic
its a holographic programme set in the drafting room at utopia planitia
ill run it on holodeck three

computer replay programme nine one four zero engine schematic at utopia planitia
programme loaded and ready

she went where
holodeck three sir i didnt think there was anything wrong with her seeing the file
of course not nothing at all


see episode booby trap for a reminder

im with you every day geordi every time you look at this engine youre looking at me every time you touch it its me

computer freeze programme
now i understand
no you dont its not the way this may look
i called up a replay of the programme file i was all ready to compliment you again commander for constructing a programme which contained the prototype engine so that you would always have a baseline reference for your modifications and now i find that its all about a fantasy plaything
its not like that i swear
im outraged by this i have been invaded violated how dare you use me like this how far did it go anyway was it good for you
nothing like that happened it was a professional collaboration
oh i can tell every time youre touching the engine youre touching me real professional
look if you watched the whole programme you saw what it was we were working together to solve a problem in a crisis situation
how do i know how far it went how many other programs did you create perhaps dozens of them one for every day of the week one for every mood
all right look ever since you came on board youve been badgering me and ive taken it ive shown you courtesy and respect and a hell of a lot of patience oh no no no wait a minute ive tried to understand you ive tried to get along with you and in return youve accused tried and convicted me without bothering to hear my side of it so im guilty okay but not of what you think of something much worse im guilty of reaching out to you of hoping we could connect im guilty of a terrible crime doctor i offered you friendship

captain its total volume has increased by eight point five percent in the last three hours i now read it at forty six million cubic metres
captain i have completed the analysis of the parents course through this system
it was headed for an asteroid belt
ensign rager set course two five nine mark three one eight half impulse
aye sir
hold a position five hundred kilometres from the periphery of the asteroid field
aye sir
difficulty getting a clear sensor reading beyond four thousand kilometres
the asteroids contain large quantities of meklonite which is interfering with our scanners i am also detecting traces of kephneum a compound found in the outer shell of the parent being it is likely the asteroids provide sustenance for this lifeform sir
we could leave the child here if datas right it would have an ample supply of food
agreed mister la forge are you ready to separate our guest from the hull
ready captain
proceed


i am deactivating the atmospheric force field now


engineering report
power drain just jumped to ninety three percent sir
captain the offspring is emitting high frequency radio transmissions
is it trying to communicate
the power drain is increasing approaching autoshutdown
take the engines offline supplement with auxiliary power only all decks go to emergency level seven life support and critical operations only
mister la forge what is your status
sorry captain

the bays been completely depressurised but its still hanging on

i am detecting other radio transmissions captain
sensors detect movement within the asteroid field bearing two five seven mark one six one
on screen magnify

at their current speed sir the entities will intercept us in ten minutes thirty one seconds
weapons status
auxiliary power only two seconds phaser fire available

ensign power readings
were on auxiliary generators life support is functioning thats about all
keep your eye on that generator console weve got less than six minutes to get that baby off our back before his relatives get here whatever we try junior responds by sucking up more energy

commander i have a thought if youre interested
of course what is it
if the baby is nursing perhaps what we need is to find a way to sour the milk if we could contaminate the energy hes feeding on we could try to
make it unpalatable somehow but the emergency generators are all weve got
and how do we modify them without losing life support
exactly unless
what
well this is a space baby right i mean these creatures are born live and die in interstellar space
apparently
okay all matter in space vibrates in a specific radiation band
twenty one centimetres thats good commander thats very good if we could alter the power frequency so that its completely foreign to the life forms natural vibrations
it might just give us enough to pour a little vinegar in babys milk
we have to be careful though if we upset it this time we might lose auxiliary power too
if were gradual enough it wont be such a shock hopefully itll just lose interest la forge to bridge
go ahead
captain doctor brahms and i have a plan

two minutes until the creatures intercept captain
captain were ready down here
proceed

lowering wavelength in the energy system now
reading eighteen fifteen thirteen eleven eight five three now at the two centimetre level
any reaction bridge

negative i detect no reduction in the life forms rate of energy consumption
one minute thirty seconds to intercept

okay not sour enough leah take it down further
reading one point eight point four

point two


i guess it noticed what were doing

the lifeform is emitting its high frequency transmission energy consumption is rising sir
captain the creatures are accelerating their approach they are changing colour
mister la forge
captain

just a little more time leah nudge it down even further toward point oh two

thirty seconds to intercept
point oh eight

oh five oh three

now at point oh two centimetres
auxiliary generators losing power captain

the entity has disengaged sir power levels are returning to normal captain

bring the engines online and take us out of here
aye sir
mister la forge doctor brahms congratulations youve weaned the baby

good work
you too

yeah i admit it i did get a little attached to that lady in the holodeck
the computer never told you that i was married
i never asked and the computer is notorious for not volunteering information
you know i really owe you an apology
no you dont i should have told you straight out
well if you had then i never wouldve got a chance to see the look on your face when you walked in on me and me in the holodeck
the look on my face how about the look on your face i will remember that for a long long time
i wouldnt change a thing except for the way i behaved i guess i came here with my own set of preconceptions about you
well i guess im just glad that i got the opportunity to get to know you the real you
me too
worf to la forge there is an incoming message on subspace for doctor brahms
acknowledged worf la forge out
my husband
night terrors

captains log stardate  we are proceeding through the rim of an uncharted binary star system where we may have located the uss brittain the missing science vessel failed to arrive at its destination and has not been heard from since a distress call twenty nine days ago


on screen magnify
thats the brittain all right
the ship is intact sir with no indication of structural damage
engines
all propulsion systems are shut down the ship is drifting sir
life form readings
inconclusive
counsellor
there is life on board but
what is it
i dont know something 
number one assemble your team
doctor crusher report to transporter room three worf data
commander i need to come too

there is no malfunction in any of the main systems sir

commander heres another one this was done by a phaser on a setting of six or seven
and more over here
the entire bridge crew
whoever did this could still be on the ship
there is someone alive but he didnt kill these people here

i think hes betazoid its all right were going to help you who did this who did this to you

were almost finished with the autopsies captain
how long will it take to compile the data
its complicated the dead were found all over the ship some were found locked in their rooms barricaded with weapons piled all around them others were found in the corridors where theyd obviously had hand to hand combat its going to take some time to analyse and sort through the details weve identified him as andrus hagan from betazed scientific advisor hes in a profound catatonic state
im not getting much captain a few words disconnected phrases i can feel his terror but i cant seem to get through to him
stay with him counsellor were examining the brittain for clues but this man is the only one left who knows what happened there
im here im right here
are there voices
voices what do they say
both things no no
keep talking to me ill try to understand

all the engines check out perfectly commander once we get them started the brittain can get back to starbase under her own power
lets give it a try
preheating injectors data fuel flow
matter valves are open and operating magnetic containment of antimatter pods is constant
okay open injectors
injectors open there is no engine activity at all sir
whats wrong
nothings wrong i dont understand it

come
ive been studying the autopsy reports the conclusion is appalling there was no outside source no alien presence all thirty four of them appear to have killed each other
what could have caused such an event drugs a virus poison
toxicological tests showed no unusual substances in their systems and they all appear to be in good health but for whatever reason they seemed to turn against each other using phasers and knives and bare hands id like you to see this captain its from the logs of the brittain captain zahevas mental condition deteriorated steadily once theyd became stranded she began talking of plots and mutinies this was the last entry log made after they had been adrift for over three weeks
first officer brink and his men were behind it they got to the engines they dont work anymore had to eliminate brink the ship is out of out of were running out too dangerous out of brink and his men


eyes in the dark one moon
where are you im coming where are you
eyes in the dark one moon eyes in the dark one moon circles see the eyes in the dark one moon
where are you

captains log stardate  four days have passed but we have made little progress in solving the mystery of the brittain i have decided we should return to starbase two twenty and to that end commander la forge is rigging the brittain for towing

im going to try recalibrating the field generators i still dont see why we cant get the engines started it just doesnt make any sense
someones still here
what did you say ensign
cant you hear it theres someone still alive on the ship i heard i mean i thought i heard something
the ship was searched thoroughly theres nobody left on board
sorry sir my mistake
dont worry about it there were thirty four people were found dead on this ship thats enough to make anybody uneasy
thank you sir

im here can you hear me tell me about the voices you hear
bright bright out there
i dont understand bright what tell me more


boy what a day this was im doing an isozyme study on some populations of cardilia but theyre turning out to have these really weird polymorphisms what a headache
is that why youre late
oh no i had a conference with doctor balthus she wants to do a study on the laticifer ontogeny of the kaladian thorn flower but i dont have time to oversee another project
was tom corbin there
what
tom corbin from the science lab remember him
of course i remember him but
you use any excuse you can to pay him a visit
miles what are you saying
i think you know exactly what im saying
if i didnt know better id say you were jealous
do you take me for a fool

hello chief having coffee
no im drinking too much coffee
im surprised to see you here at this hour
whys that
youre not out of the honeymoon yet usually newlyweds cant keep their hands off each other
she has work to do she heads up the plant biology lab you know
any strange things going on down there
like what
ive been hearing things kenicki in engineering told me he saw a man in an old starfleet uniform riding the lift near the engine core when the lift got to the top there was no one on it
ghost stories
theres more theres lots more there are strange things happening on this ship obrien
im surprised at you gillespie a starfleet officer i have more things to worry about than shades and spirits


come

come

yes yes

come

what
captain do you have a moment
were concerned were afraid whatever happened on the brittain may be starting here
explain
well beverly and i have been getting unusual reports people behaving strangely others hearing sounds that arent there
are we talking about hallucinations
in some cases in others just erratic behaviour
we cant track down any element that might be responsible
but everything started when we found the brittain
yes captain we have to get the enterprise away from here before it gets any worse
were preparing to take the brittain in tow well be on our way within the hour

ensign manoeuvre us into tractor beam range
aye sir
is there a problem ensign
i cant seem to remember how to enter the coordinates sir
ensign lin
ready now captain
report to sickbay ensign rager
ready tractor beam mister worf
captain thrusters are losing power
impulse engines ahead minimum power
impulse engines are not responding sir
geordi whats going on down there
i dont know sir nothings responding
go to warp engines factor one engage
captain

we dont have warp drive either

we have no functional propulsion systems
no sir apparently we do not
were adrift
just like the brittain
captains log stardate  the enterprise has now been adrift for a total of ten days we have sent subspace distress calls but because of our distant location we cannot expect a response for at least another two weeks

after analysing the sensor logs of the brittain and the enterprise as well as the data from the last series of probes i conclude that we have become trapped in a massive rupture in space into which energy is absorbed
you mean a tykens rift
a what
a rare anomaly named after bela tyken the melthusian captain who first encountered it
tykens rift that would explain why we dont have engine power
the ships energy is being drained into the fissure before we can utilise it

i was detained
when tyken was trapped in the rift his analysis determined that a massive energy release might overload and dislocate the anomaly fortunately his cargo included anicium and yurium which he used to detonate the explosion he then escaped through the ruptured centre of the rift
but we arent carrying anything that could produce that kind of explosion not even our photon torpedoes would be enough
couldnt we replicate the elements that tyken used
no sir we no longer have the power to reproduce complex elements in the replicator we must find a way to generate a violent energy release without using conventional means
data in tykens experience did the crew exhibit behavioural changes
no there were no reports of unusual conduct among the crew
what about nightmares
there were no records of sleep disturbances of any kind counsellor
then what is it whats happening to us

the only one who doesnt seem affected by all this is data

bridge
 number one how
sir
any hallucinations nightmares
no id be a liar if i said i felt like myself ive had to bite my tongue to keep from snapping at people a couple of times ive gone to my quarters and felt as if there was someone in there waiting for me
ive had similar feelings with everyone succumbing its even more important that one of us attempt to keep control of his faculties i want you to turn in take a nap ill be on the bridge you can relieve me in four hours
yes sir deck eight





no

sir

as you were mister data will you join me in my ready room



commander la forge and i have come up with a potential solution to our predicament perhaps the modifications used to increase firepower against the borg could be effective here
channelling power to the main er deflector dish
yes sir i believe that within six hours we could generate a concentrated burst of energy which might disrupt the tykens rift
very well proceed mister data
yes sir
it appears that i am not immune to the strange forces that are at work on this ship
yes sir
its a terrifying prospect to lose control of ones mind when i was young i remember watching my grandfather deteriorate from a powerful intelligent figure to a frail wisp of a man who could barely make his own way home mister data it is my responsibility somehow to see that this ship is guided to safety i will need to rely on you from now on we may need to count on you for our very survival
i will do my best sir


id like to do more crosssections on the brain tissue of some of these bodies set up the positron emission sensor in sickbay and ill decide which ones i want to study
yes doctor

go away


captain let me ask you this since we located the brittain can you remember any of your dreams
i hardly ever recall dreams
most people dont but think have you even had a dream in the last ten days
i dont recall
im willing to bet you havent whats more neither has anyone else on board this ship except for troi i began to realise that when she talked about having nightmares ive done some additional brain tissue tests on er bodies some of the bodies from the er the
the brittain doctor
right and ive also done some scans on a random crosssection from our crew they both have the same results a unique chemical imbalance
caused by
dream deprivation every night when we enter into sleep
i believe the doctor means is that humans enter what is known as rem sleep rapid eye movement it is the level of brain wave activity at which one dreams
we have to dream in order to survive if we dont reach rem sleep we dont dream we begin to lose our cognitive abilities we find it hard to concentrate we forget how to do the most ordinary task then we become irritable paranoid some people experience hallucinations
youre describing the situation on this ship but counsellor troi reported nightmares
maybe its because shes betazoid i dont know why all i know is theres more going on here than being caught in a tykens rift and i dont know how or why its happening but i do know this there is an inevitable conclusion to this pattern and if i cant find a way to stop it we will all go insane



eyes in the dark one moon circles
where are you
eyes in the dark one moon circles

im still here i havent gone anywhere do you remember anything more
double double
what does that mean is something doubled

deanna nothings working ive tried somatic drugs ive tried inducing theta waves into the entorhinal cortex no matter what i do no one can reach rem sleep no one can dream except for you
except me and all i have is nightmares i can hardly sleep at all anymore in the end ill be like him just like him


well i think its some kind of experiment you see captain picard is trying to see how long well take it stuck here like rats
you couldnt be more wrong
its like were laboratory animals i dont want to sit and wait for death to sneak up behind me
whats that supposed to mean
you heard about them on the brittain shut in their rooms dying alone thats not for me id rather go out fighting

okay all the power has been channelled to the er the
the main deflector dish
yes right the deflector dish so what do we do now
data to bridge mister worf activate the deflector
aye sir

deflector power banks approaching maximum discharge in fifteen seconds

data this detonation better work were not going to last much longer

discharge in three seconds two one

nothing it just fizzled out
captain it appears the energy output

has been absorbed into the rift
data can we try again
no sir if we draw

more power we risk losing life support systems
understood keep me appraised commander



lujpu jihe alexandrijn

worf no
you will not stop me
security to lieutenant worfs quarters immediately
no one can stop me
why what is it
i am no longer a warrior i am no longer strong i feel
what what do you feel
i feel fear
to admit that youre afraid gives you strength
something is waiting for us i am not strong enough to fight it
no worf its just an illusion its not real please put down the knife

counsellor
its all right everythings fine thank you

let me take you to sickbay
acting captains log stardate  i have assumed command of the enterprise at the request of captain picard our situation is deteriorating many of the crew are unable to function and our life support systems are beginning to falter

once before you said double what did you mean what is double
mates too bright twin cannot leave the twin one moon circling
what do you mean you cant leave
no no please cant
you want to leave why cant you
cant go help one moon circling eyes thats it eyes in the dark
eyes in the dark thats what the voice said in my dream is that where you heard it in a dream over and over beverly i know what it is i know whats happening
what
my nightmare its not a dream its not a dream at all its a message

rem sleep occurs at a different frequency for betazoids than other humanoids i believe the beings are using that frequency to communicate telepathically
it is possible that this telepathic communication is creating interference in the rem sleep of other species that would explain why the rest of our crew is not dreaming
counsellor what are these beings trying to tell us
theyre calling for help i think theyre trapped just like we are eyes in the dark could mean this twin star system
your hypothesis is certainly plausible there may be another ship on the other side of the fissure where we cannot detect it
is there a way we could block their signals
there is no technology to block telepathic transmissions doctor
maybe communication through dreams can work both ways i could try to get them to stop
perhaps we can accomplish more than that if there is another ship and we can reach them we might be able to coordinate our efforts to free ourselves
it is conceivable when working with patients with debilitating nightmares ive often used a therapeutic treatment called directed dreaming dreamers can learn to control of their dreams retain a conscious memory even while in rem sleep i could remember a short message and deliver it to them
if it were possible what would you say


working together with the aliens we must discover a means by which we an produce an explosion more intense than either one of us could achieve alone
what is it youre looking for
these are the elements we have available some of them could be used in the creation of an explosive reaction if we could communicate this inventory to the other ship perhaps they would be able to
no data no this is too complex this has to be a simple clear message
i am uncertain if a simple transmission will be adequate
stop go back further back there stop one moon circles
yes counsellor one electron circles one proton this is a hydrogen atom
one moon circles thats what theyve been telling me over and over
perhaps the aliens are thinking as we are to collaborate in producing an explosion if hydrogen is combined with another element calendenium for example it is extremely volatile but would the message mean they have hydrogen or they want hydrogen
well if its a distress call i think theyd be asking for what they need not what they already have
then the proper course of action would be to release hydrogen into the rift and hope that they have a substance that will detonate it
how do i tell them what to do
if you are correct counsellor i believe they have already told us what to do and are waiting for us to do it when we are ready the only message you should attempt to convey is now

i can help keep you in rem sleep for a while with this cortical scanner it will maintain electrical activity in your brain at the proper frequency

counsellor

you will have to communicate with the other ship within two minutes of entering rem sleep
two minutes

is that all data
unfortunately yes

we have only enough power to emit a hydrogen stream for that amount of time they must understand that they will have to detonate it immediately captain we are ready to implement the plan
proceed
we will have to draw power from the lifesupport systems in order to discharge the collectors this is acting captain data all personnel will report to designated shelter areas

immediately life support systems will continue only in emergency shelter areas
hear that get us jammed into shelter areas we sit and wait to die nobodyll ever find us
relax gillespie everybody relax ten forward is a designated shelter area relax
do we want to die here like helpless children
security to ten forward immediately
we dont even know what were dying for
sit down gillespie youre not helping matters any
whats wrong with standing up for ourselves

picard owes us some answers

what is that
its a little souvenir i picked up on magus three that was setting number one anyone want to see setting number two

pgo signals steady visual cortex showing increased activity rapid eye movements commencing crusher to bridge

shes in rem sleep
thank you doctor activating bussard collectors


where are you

ninety seconds remaining

one moon circles
where are you i have to find you i have to tell you

forty five seconds remaining

one moon
please i must find you to tell you

thirty seconds remaining

eyes in the dark one moon


ten seconds remaining

nothing no explosion
the counsellor was unsuccessful

activate impulse engines
engines activated sir


we have cleared the rift sir warp engines are coming back online
set a course to
setting a course for starbase two twenty sir as my final duty as acting captain i order you to bed i shall do the same for all personnel
very well mister data and mister data thank you
pleasant dreams sir
identity crisis



tarchannen three investigation stardate  ensign anthony brevelle recording lieutenant susanna leijten in command
you up and running brevelle
yes lieutenant
ive checked buildings four and five just like all the others no phaser hits no sign of a fight its like the entire outpost just vanished
lieutenant leijten youd better come see this no footprints no vehicle tracks the wind probably erased them but look

freeze visual


thats hickman on the right mendez on the left and as already noted the recording was made by ensign brevelle five years ago
commander leijten you said that before brevelle deserted starbase one one two last week hed been ill for several days what about mendez
mendez was seen on the aries an hour before she disappeared according to witnesses she seemed completely normal
and hickman
he just passed a routine physical on alia four with flying colours
no wait i know paul hickman hes a family man hes got two kids he wouldnt steal a shuttle and desert
geordi he was spotted by a federation supply ship yesterday on course to tarchannen three
the original tarchannen disappearances were never solved were they
no we never learned what happened or why forty nine people gone
and five years later the away team that was investigating their disappearances have started to disappear themselves
geordi and i are the only two left
captains log stardate  weve set a course to intercept lieutenant hickmans stolen shuttlecraft and hopefully to discover the whereabouts of the other missing officers

and then i almost married paul bogrow
bogrow bogrow now which one was he
you remember the one with the thin moustache
oh not bogrow
i know
the one who always used to drive you crazy you always thought he was so full of himself
well i decided i had prejudged him unfairly and then i decided that id been right in the first place
bogrow
what about you
i enjoy the bachelors life too much
that doesnt sound like my little brother who always wanted advice on women
well obviously you were a great advisor  well suz what do you think
i dont know but im not ashamed to tell you im a little scared you know
yeah i know
well if anybodys going to figure this out itll be the leitjen and la forge show right
yeah
we always made a good team
a hell of a team
commander la forge commander leijten report to the bridge we have a fix on the missing shuttle
on our way commander

 entering the tarchannen system sir
slow to impulse power mister worf
long range sensors holding on the shuttlecraft bearing zero one zero mark two seven one
hail the vessel
lieutenant hickman does not respond sir
put a repeating message on all subspace channels order the lieutenant to come about and stand to make it a priority one communiqu
still no response sir
the craft is now within visual range
on screen
the shuttles acceleration is increasing its trajectory is moving directly into the planets atmosphere he will reach an atmospheric interface at an altitude of two hundred and ten kilometres
if he stays at that speed hell selfdestruct
that is correct commander
how soon mister data
fifty three seconds sir
options
hes out of transporter range
hes still too far away to get a positive lock with the tractor beam captain
open a channel
open
lieutenant hickman listen carefully this is captain picard of the enterprise you are in danger you must slow your rate of approach
the shuttle is approaching the outer thermosphere captain
hes panicking
at current rate of acceleration the shuttle will be destroyed in twenty eight seconds
sixteen seconds to impact
lieutenant hickman you must do what i tell you reduce your velocity and bring your craft to a positive pitch of twenty degrees now
the shuttles entering the lower ionosphere sir

captain sensors detect two more federation shuttlecraft on the planet surface no life signs
number one prepare your away team
worf data geordi
id like to volunteer to join you sir
commander


commander leijten geordi check out the shuttle data worf youve got the perimeter
its the shuttlepod mendez stole from the aries

no life signs commander
sir i am certain we are being watched
commander riker found it in the shuttle  wheres commander leijten
riker to susanna report fan out lets find her
susanna la forge to leijten
over here

where have you been
mendez and brevelle are alive you saw the footprints
yeah but theyre not human
theyre here just stand still and listen you can feel it theyre here
im not picking up anything wait a minute where are you going susanna
stay away
suz

la forge to enterprise medical emergency two to sickbay

do i look as bad as i feel
you look fine now
what happened
your blood chemistry is way off you had a histamine response to what i dont know im going to run a complete blood and tissue analysis
i need to get back to the surface
until we have some answers i dont want you to leave the enterprise
i have work to do
look commander you may have just had an anxiety reaction down there but ive got to know for sure
might not be such a bad idea to take it easy for a while
im not going to stay locked up on this ship while the investigations going on
your devotion to duty is admirable commander but doctor crusher is right you will remain on the enterprise until we know whether or not this is connected to the disappearance of the others
captain
we have completed our survey on the surface analysing that data will keep us busy for a while
yes sir i understand
datas got a preliminary report if youre up to it
sure lets get going

what about la forge
i gave him a complete bioscan the results say hes in perfect shape
thats what the reports said about mendez and hickman before they disappeared

captain picards wrong the way to handle this is to get back down there with a dozen away teams fan out from the shuttle we could cover a lot of ground in a hurry use proximity detectors infrared sensors

susanna
oh geordi its started what if what happened to the others is happening to me
you dont know that suz im here and im not going to let anything happen to you okay okay come on


during microscopic examination of the torn uniform i discovered these alien skin cells
source
undetermined
without something else to crossreference it would take us weeks to try and identify them
fortunately we have more evidence we were able to determine that these footprints found near the shuttle were not made by any known tarchannen life form
if were pursuing a theory that somehow unknown aliens are involved i think i should tell you that we didnt find tracks like that during the original investigation
the planet is subject to frequent sandstorms footprints might have been obliterated prior to your arrival doctor crusher and i will begin to search the medical database in an attempt to match these with some known life form

aliens or no aliens why would our people start returning after five years to be abducted
some sort of compulsion like a posthypnotic command
something that happened while we were down there the first time
we can go back to the mission record construct a log of everyones movements
look for some commonality something we all touched maybe a plant or the sand
or even something we ingested it could even be in the air itself

the parameters are pretty broad data any match we make is going to be inconclusive at best
i am aware of that doctor however i can see no other reasonable course of investigation available to us and we may not have much time
youre worried about geordi arent you
i am an android it is not possible
for you to feel anxiety
starfleet personnel have vanished others may be at risk we must do the best we can to find out why however i am strongly motivated to solve this mystery


freeze visuals
were wasting our time
thats not how you felt before it was your idea to look for some sort of commonality
yeah well i was wrong were not going to find anything this way we should go back to the planet its all down there everything we need to know
thats just not an option at least not until captain picard says it is computer resume
i cant look at that anymore it hurts my eyes i cant think my brain feels like its wrapped up in a blanket
take a break all right ill work on this
i dont need a break i need to get off the ship
susanna why dont we go and see doctor crusher
forget crusher and forget your logs tarchannens down there geordi its waiting for us thats where we should go
susanna you cant leave susanna susanna
geordi


her blood pressures still falling apply the tcell stimulator we have got to stabilise her immune system

she has developed an extreme sensitivity to light were trying to make her as comfortable as we can

oh god
geordi
susanna hold on okay doctor crusher will help you so just hold on
its inside of me geordi i cant fight it its winning
dont give up do you hear me you cant give up suz

this is one of susannas altered skin cells and this is one of the alien cells data found
theyre almost identical how do you explain that
jeanluc i think the people from tarchannen three who disappeared werent abducted i think they were transformed into another species
can you stop it doctor
the tcell stimulator will slow the rate of change but until i find the cause
is the enterprise at risk
no i checked the cell wall integrity its viability is extremely low i dont think its possible for susanna to transmit it
then how did she get it
i wish i knew the only thing i do know geordi is that its very possible that youll be next
but i had two full bioscans today you said i was fine
i gave susanna a bioscan too i didnt find anything wrong with her either
how long
brevelle was sick for days before he left mendez was normal an hour before she disappeared you may have weeks or very few hours
then theres not much time to waste i should get back to work
geordi until i know what were dealing with i think you should stay here in sickbay
doctor you said it would help if you knew the source of this if i can continue my analysis of the mission records i might find an answer
mister la forge what if you begin to change what if you feel compelled to go down to the planet like the others
programme the computer to monitor my movements that way we can be sure that i dont leave the ship what would you do captain would you sit it out here in sickbay or try to learn what it is thats got you and maybe stop it
very well mister la forge you proceed with your investigation but i want you to report to doctor crusher for a bioscan at the start of day watch
aye sir
and geordi if you have symptoms of any kind i want to know immediately
understood

one to transport
i want to make another sweep of the perimeter la forge you start at building four mendez and brevelle begin at two ill take five

all right computer analyse audio elements from time index fourteen four seven to fifteen five eight list all anomalies
no audio anomalies present
any subspace projections zparticle emissions interferometric frequencies
no subspace projections present no zparticle emissions present no interferometric patterns present
damn
geordi may i inquire how your investigation is proceeding
its not
have you attempted an audio analysis
yes data and a spectrographic analysis and a screen for ionising radiation i even ran an enhancement for microseismic disturbances ive tried it all okay im sorry data
there is no need for an apology perhaps if you indulged in a brief rest period you would be able to approach this problem with a fresh point of view
yeah youre probably right data but ive got to keep scanning these records while i can
may i can assist you
if i knew what i was looking for rally data i think its just a matter of me going over it maybe finding something i forgot ill let you know if i come across anything all right all right computer one more time

sorry to disturb you doctor
thats all right whats happened
i thought you should see this

her skin is simulating light a radiant reaction some sort of mimetic ability
thats not all her body temperature is dropping
its as if shes generating a disruptive field i can barely get any readings off her now whats her rate of transformation
its increasing
thats not possible it should have been inhibited by the tcell stimulator unless if theres a foreign body inside her thats producing these changes something like a viral crche
a very small one if our scans havent found it
i want a full genetic analysis were going to examine any abnormality we find no matter how insignificant it seems

one to transport
computer delete the audio
wait a minute freeze visual whose shadow is that
please restate question
computer the shadow currently displayed in section b three what is its source
unknown
come on its got to belong to somebody computer replay a visual of the last time index no audio and slow to fifty percent okay brevelles behind the camera susanna and i head off in that direction mendez moves off that way freeze visual now magnify four times and spectrally enhance those shadows  computer do you have sufficient data to compile a holographic simulation of this visual record
a simulation would be limited to areas scanned by the visual recording device
good fine scan the entire record and then recreate it on holodeck three

computer is the tarchannen simulation ready
affirmative programme complete enter when ready


computer scan starfleet records and create a simulation of brevelle place him where he was while recording this okay good computer based on their speed and direction can you extrapolate each officers movements as they walk out of the recording devices field of view
affirmative with an increasing probability of error reaching ninety five percent after ten seconds
understood run simulation
i want to make another sweep of the perimeter la forge you start at building four mendez and brevelle you begin at two ill take five

computer freeze its all happening too fast computer reverse simulation run it back to time index fourteen seven two

freeze programme computer remove la forge and now remove leitjen and now remove mendez

computer using vector analysis identify the source of this shadow
there is no object in the programme which could generate the shadow
there has to be something between the camera light and this wall computer given the distance between the light and the wall can you determine the most likely shape and position of the object causing this shadow
there is insufficient data to reconstruct the requested object
all right lets say that my friend and i here are about the same size say one pint seven metres now can you extrapolate its shape and its position
affirmative
do it



there in the thymus some sort of parasite its using susannas immune system to spread genetic instructions
how did it get there
she could have become infected during the original mission its small enough to have entered through any of the mucous membranes but it certainly isnt behaving like a typical parasite it isnt feeding off of her its transforming her dna to match its own
theres not much of her original dna left
and were going to need unaltered genes or well never get her back weve got to get that thing out of her now

any luck
negative commander nothing in our survey suggests the source of a parasitic infection
crusher to bridge
go ahead doctor
the surgery was successful

but its going to be a few more hours before we know how her regenerative systems are responding in the meantime wed better get commander la forge down here
very well doctor keep us informed
crusher to la forge computer locate commander la forge
commander la forge is not on board the enterprise
bridge the computer says commander la forge is no longer on board is that correct

i am showing no transporter activity
all shuttles are secure
negative theres no indication that hes left the ship
computer what was the last known location of commander la forge
holodeck three

captain if geordi has transformed he may be virtually a chameleon

the skin develops mimetic capabilities he may still be on board but undetectable to our sensors


you search the structure i will take the perimeter

commander
geordis uniform


security we have an intruder in transporter room six argh


captain the security lockout on transporter room six has been broken
reengage now
i cannot sir the transporter cycle has already begun
captains log stardate  doctor crushers research indicates that we have less than an hour before commander la forges transformation becomes irreversible however all attempts to locate him on the surface have failed

i do not read any life signs on the surface
our sensor array is useless we must find some other way of locating him
captain if we can get close enough to geordi we can read his absorption spectrum with an ultraviolet light
can you modify an emergency beacon to operate on uv
yes sir
make it so number one as soon as data is ready i want you to lead an away team
aye sir

how long data
i must replace the emitter module and reconnect the power supply it will take approximately two minutes to complete the modification sir
hedrick to commander riker
go ahead
ive been able to determine la forges transport coordinates he beamed down next to the aries shuttle
acknowledged hes on foot couldnt have gotten too far lets assume a radius of ten kilometres
that still leaves a search area of more than three hundred square kilometres
weve got to narrow that down whats happening with the enhanced sensor arrays
all scans are still negative
weve got to find a way to track him what about the highresolution em scans
we are adjusting sensors to read commander la forges absorption spectrum but it will take several hours
geordi doesnt have several hours
i have completed modifications commander
excellent doctor crusher meet us in transporter room six immediately

hes going to need a sedative give me ten ccs of kayolane
doctor crusher

say you look a lot better than you did an hour ago
what did you do
weve removed some kind of parasite from your thymus
no no no its not a parasite doctor it was their method of reproduction to plant a dna strand in a living host that causes metamorphosis geordi hes gone
yes
hes gone back to the planet
try to stay calm
no but we have to find him
an away team is preparing to search for him
youll never be able to find him im the only one who can


no you must turn them off the light frightens them
what about the ultraviolet
thats beyond their visual spectrum they wont run away from it
he could be several kilometres away by now
no hes here theyre all here

there

geordi
geordi stop

no wait

geordi geordi my voice is familiar listen to it you can feel that we share this you know im not a threat the others mendez brevelle they dont exist as humans any more but a part of you still does youre not one of them yet geordi i can help you if youll just trust me i know whats going on inside of you the war youre fighting with yourself your humanity slipping away the instinct to run its overpowering but they know how to beat it now geordi look at me ive come back geordi let me take you back too just take my hand please

crusher to enterprise lock on to commander leitjens signal prepare to beam two directly to sickbay
were going home geordi


is there no hope for brevelle or mendez
none
susanna
im right here geordi and so are doctor crusher and captain picard
heres your visor geordi
lieutenant commander la forge reporting for duty captain
welcome back mister la forge
geordi this species can you communicate with it
no they act on instinct alone in another few minutes i wouldnt have responded to you susanna
then we will leave them be ill order warning beacons placed in orbit and on the surface hopefully no one else will have to go through what you did

you know down there i didnt know who you were and yet somehow i believed you i trusted you
mustve been because of all the good advice i used to give you
thanks
the nth degree



you were like a brother to me do you remember we used played in the park near the lake
yes of course every summer you came to bergerac
you used to make swords out of the reeds and when you cut your hand you would come running to me and i would say let me see oh how did you do that
playing near the porte de nesle

and how many did you plat against
no more than a hundred
tell me
no
 let it go
 what
 let it go
let it go let it go you tell me what you were going to say do you dare
i do dare i love someone
ah
he does not know
ah
not yet but he is proud noble brave and beautiful
beautiful
whats the matter
with me nothing it is my hand he is in the guards
since this morning baron christien de neuvillette in your own regiment
ah
promise me promise me to be his friend
i promise
oh i love you i must go now oh and tell him to write me a hundred men what courage
oh but i have done better since

bravo
wonderful wonderful
lieutenant barclays performance was adequate but clearly not rooted in the method approach i do not understand why
data because its polite
good job reg and only what six weeks of lessons
good job period
we have a patient teacher
ah worf i have an opening in my workshop

well done
thank you counsellor
youve come a long way reg
after more rehearsals than i can count
i dont just mean your acting ability it takes a great deal of courage to put yourself on display like that
you think so
there was a time when nothing could have dragged you onto a stage in front of an audience youve made tremendous progress
i i guess
dont you think so
well i just feel more more comfortable playing somebody else maybe all this is not any better than escaping into a holodeck fantasy
i disagree this isnt fantasy its theatre you used to withdraw onto the holodeck you isolated yourself inside your own imagination avoiding contact with real people look at yourself now look at all the other people youre with youre not just acting youre interacting give yourself some credit mister barclay
maybe youre right
captains log stardate  we have arrived at the argus array a remote subspace telescope at the very edge of federation space the unmanned structure mysteriously stopped relaying its data nearly two months ago

the fusion reactors that power the array are extremely unstable there is a high risk of overload
what about the computer systems
they do not seem to be functioning at all sir
captain i am picking up an unidentified device one point eight kilometres from the array
on screen magnify

thats some kind of probe ill bet thats what damaged the array
is it emitting any signals lieutenant
negative sir i show no activity
mister la forge why not go out and take a closer look
aye sir lieutenant barclay report to the main shuttlebay

enterprise this is shuttle five in position ready to begin a shortrange scan
proceed shuttle five
reg why dont we begin with the passive highres series all right
electromagnetic band
give it a try
im picking up visual wavelengths only between forty five hundred and seven thousand angstroms
lets try the neutron densitometer
nothing
hmm doesnt seem to want to give up any secrets lets go to active scan
no no modulation
really you are definitely not from our neighbourhood increase to three point zero
commander
yeah reg
thanks for assigning me to this mission
dont mention it youre one of my top engineers its about time you got in on some of the interesting stuff this this is why im in starfleet
theres still no modulation
hit it with a positron emission

what was that computers down reg reg

captains log supplemental an intense energy surge from the alien probe has severely disabled the shuttles onboard computer the away team has been transported directly to sickbay where lieutenant barclay remains under observation

any indication of the probes energy source data
no sir power emissions do not match any known radiation patterns we have not encountered this technology before sir
very well isolate the probe and place it in tow well take it to science station four oh two in the kohlan system
captain the probe has begun to move it is approaching the enterprise
shields up
aye sir

there was enough energy in that flash to overload your optic nerves it knocked you unconscious
my visor must have filtered it out
exactly but there was no apparent retinal damage and the cornea looks fine but im still waiting for a full seroamino readout ill call you when it comes in  id like this done as quickly as possible ensign
you shouldnt have to wait too long for the results
what do you mean
couldnt you use a global mode in your scanner it would be a lot faster
thats not possible were talking about human cells here not isolinear circuits i think youd better stick to engineering lieutenant
a cell has a an electromagnetic signature just like a circuit element does theoretically it should work with just a few adjustments i could set it up for you if youd like


probe now closing at fifteen point three metres per second collision course
captain sensors are reading no particulate emissions or subspace field distortions
then how is it able to move
method of propulsion is unknown sir
ensign take us away from it one quarter impulse
 aye sir
the probe is matching our speed and course
captain an energy field is forming around the device intensity is three point two terawatts and increasing
sir the shuttlecraft shields did not provide sufficient protection for its computer our computer may also be vulnerable i recommend withdrawal to a safe distance
ensign anaya full about half impulse
one half impulse
the probe is following
options number one
we cant use photon torpedoes an explosion this close could cripple us
sir recommend full phasers
proceed
firing phasers

no effect captain
the probes field intensity is continuing to build sir we are in danger
riker to la forge can you increase phaser power

attempting to now commander isolate phasers eighty to one twenty shunt all the plasma
to the emitters yes sir im already on it ready
phasers are as hot as we can make them captain

mister worf
aye sir
nothing
go to warp two
aye sir warp two
the probe is still with us sir
at warp two
yes sir
captain the probes energy output is overloading our shields failure anticipated in forty seven seconds
im willing to entertain suggestions
captain were dropping to impulse

 commander warp power has been transferred to the shield grid
yeah but by whom

barclay what are you doing
lieutenant barclay to captain picard you can fire photon torpedoes

maximum yield full spread
were too close
im certain the shields will hold
mister la forge

i dont know how he did it but shield strength has been increased by three hundred percent

it should be enough captain
mister worf photon torpedoes maximum yield full spread
aye

thank you mister barclay

youre welcome captain barclay out im sorry if i overstepped my authority
 dont mention it
captains log stardate  the enterprise has destroyed the alien probe but now we are left with the difficult task of repairing the argus telescope failure to do so would represent an incalculable scientific loss

mister barclay everyones still trying to figure out exactly how you did it
well it just occurred to me that i could set up a frequency harmonic between the deflector and the shield grid using the warp field generator as a power flow antiattenuator and that of course naturally created an amplification of the inherent energy output
uh huh i see that

im glad you could join us mister barclay your report mister la forge
each of the telescopes subspace antenna clusters is powered by its own fusion reactor but a single computer controls them all
so all eighteen reactors were affected when the computer was damaged
thats right theyre starting to overload and could eventually go critical the explosion would destroy the array and i wouldnt want to be next door when that happens
a standard isolation procedure would be advisable
i agree well cut off each reactor from the damaged control system and repair them one by one
how long will that take
two to three weeks at least
all right mister la forge
i dont agree we could repair all of the reactors simultaneously instead of one by one
simultaneously all eighteen
yes sir
but the argus computer is inoperable
not entirely the core memory is still intact and we could programme a completely new control system
an interesting suggestion lieutenant however that approach would require much more time than our original plan at least seven weeks
i could have it ready for you in two days
what
if you could assist me in the morning commander
sure reg


the moon yes thatll be my home my paradise i shall find there all the souls i love socrates galileo and when i arrive they will question my worthiness what the devil is he doing there among us philosopher scientist poet musician duellist here lies hercule savinien de cyrano de bergerac i would not have you weep any less for that charming good and handsome christien i only ask this that as the great cold surrounds my bones you allow a double meaning for your mourning veil and when you let fall your tears fall for him some few will be for me
that was a real improvement
same time day after tomorrow
same time

reg may i join you
of course please sit down counsellor
hard at work
im getting prepared for tomorrows meeting in engineering were planning our repair strategy
i really enjoyed the scene you just performed
youre a very forgiving audience
not at all i thought you were brilliant youve changed
is that a professional opinion
pure observation
no its true i cant explain it in the last few days ive found confidence i never knew was there
im proud of you reg im glad for you too well id better be going
must you
i think so
wouldnt you like to take a walk with me through the arboretum the zalnias should be in bloom
reg as your former counsellor i dont think it would be appropriate
i dont need a counsellor what i need is the company of a charming intelligent woman
goodnight mister barclay

wheres lieutenant barclay
i stopped by his quarters on my way over he wasnt there
computer location of lieutenant barclay
lieutenant barclay is on holodeck three

g sub i j of t as t approaches infinity
g of t over g naught
so it is so it is
i still dont see how youre going to incorporate quantum principle into general relativity without adjusting the cosmological constant a lot more than youre doing here
if we increase the value as you suggest we must face the possibility of twenty six dimensions instead of ten
i dont think i could deal with that
i certainly could not
if the semiset curved into the subatomic the infinities might cancel each other out
gruss gott they just might
we had a meeting at oh seven hundred
im sorry commander thank you professor end programme

what was that all about
i had some ideas late last night i needed to consult with the computer about some quantum electrodynamic calculations a holodeck einstein programme seemed like the best way i guess i went a little overboard
a little most of the stuff on that blackboard was way out of my league and yours too
not really i just havent thought along those lines before its all pretty evident now and if you were to put your mind to it im sure
reg ever since our run in with that probe somethings different about you
what because im beginning to behave like the rest of the crew with confidence in what im doing
you just spent the entire night arguing grand unification theories with albert einstein
yes but
reg somethings happened to you and we cant ignore that
yes ive finally become the person ive always wanted to be do we have to ask why
yeah i think we do

incredible the production of neurotransmitters in your brain has jumped by over five hundred percent pre and postsynaptic membranes have increased permeability to match it i couldnt even guess at your iq level now
probably somewhere between twelve hundred and fourteen fifty
but that isnt all the corpus callosum the connecting bridge between both sides of the brain it is so active now that the hemispheres are essentially behaving as one
so its not just raw intelligence were talking about here
no creativity resourcefulness inspiration imagination theyve all been enhanced lieutenant you could very well be the most advanced human being who has ever lived

whatever that alien probe did to him barclay now seems to know more about the internal workings of the enterprise than anyone else on board
the question is how are we going to deal with it
we could confine him to his quarters
how can we do that whats he done were talking about locking a man up for being too smart
if hes been influenced by an alien wouldnt that put us all at risk
not necessarily it might be something as simple as an allergic reaction to a bee sting
has mister barclay done anything that could be considered potentially threatening
well he did make a pass at me last night  a good one
id hardly consider that a threat
no but its certainly unusual behaviour for barclay
theres something else captain he taught violin technique at the music school last night
i didnt know barclay played the violin
he didnt not until last night
look if we want to save the array we need barclay its as simple as that
until he does something more menacing i see no reason why we should prevent him from continuing his work
larson to commander la forge
go ahead lieutenant

were having trouble containing reactor nine sir its starting to chain
im on my way

you said he made a pass at you but you failed to mention whether he was successful or not


thermal levels up one hundred seventy seven percent comparable increase in neutron emissions
is the interface between the computer and the array still in operation
yes but our computer is too slow to direct the repairs the parameters are changing too quickly for it to keep up
then well have to try a remote shutdown from here
transmitting commands to the array now sir starting close down sequence
brower increase the intake of liquid helium three into the reactor wall weve got to cool it off
transmitting commands thermal levels increasing sir
what happened
unclear the interface isnt fast enough
commander la forge overload indications on argus generator five seven and fourteen
damn
i cant do anything from here i have to find a better interface
la forge to bridge were looking at a cascade reactor failure on the argus

i dont think were going to pull this one out
reactor nine will reach critical in ten minutes forty three seconds the subsequent explosion will create a chain reaction along the entire length of the array sir
ensign standby for a jump to warp two
yes sir
la forge youve got ten minutes mister worf red alert
aye commander

computer begin new programme create as follows workstation chair  now create a standard alphanumeric console positioned for left hand now an iconic display console positioned for right hand tie both consoles into the enterprise main computer core utilising neuralscan interface
there is no such device on file
no problem heres how you build it

argus reactor nine twenty eight seconds to critical
get us out of here
warp two ensign
yes sir helms not responding
captain we have lost computer control
what
twelve seconds to critical
go to manual
im attempting that sir
theres not enough time
computer is coming back online sir
captain the argus reactors are shutting down we are no longer in danger sir
what happened
unknown sir
geordi what did you do

it wasnt me sir

computer how were the argus reactors shut down
a neural interface was created to expedite the repairs
barclay
computer respond
i am responding sir im sorry if i caused you any alarm it was necessary in order to secure the array
barclay

barclay whats going on barclay

yes commander its me

im sorry captain i was only trying to help our computer was too slow to compensate for the overload on the array so i created an interface that communicated my thoughts directly to the central processing unit
exactly what does that mean
my body is as you see it here but much of my higher brain functions and memory have been transferred to the starboard computer core
mister barclay remove yourself from the computer system leave the holodeck
im afraid i cant sir
why not
my primary cerebral functions are now operating almost entirely from within the computer they have expanded to such a degree that it would be impossible to return to the confines of my human brain any attempt to do so would mean my death

thats it ive disconnected the visual and audio pickups we can talk without being monitored by the computer
by barclay
report mister la forge
it is now almost impossible to tell where barclay ends and the computer begins hes actually rewriting the isolinear chips each time he extends himself a little further
how do we get him out of there
we dont not without killing him
this is an intolerable situation i have no wish to harm him but i cannot allow mister barclay to continue to act as the computer i dont care how smart he is
lieutenant barclay has not yet extended himself into the engineering subsystems it may be possible to establish an odn bypass directly to the bridge
that still wont give us control of the ship
no but it would give us access to the propulsion systems enough to get us to the next starbase
how long would it take to set that up
a few hours
make it so

commander la forge
yeah reg
i thought you would be in your quarters
no im just catching up on some work you know that level three diagnostic we talked about howre you doing
i wish i could convey to you what its like for me now what ive become
yeah try
i can conceive almost infinite possibilities and can fully explore each of them in a nanosecond i perceive the universe as a single equation and it is so simple i understand
you understand
everything
well do you understand how this happened to you
i believe it is a gift that i have been chosen to fulfill a great purpose
ah ha
do you suppose all of this has changed the way people think about me
to tell you the truth reg we dont know what to think
ive been concerned about that but soon everyone will understand what i can do for humanity
what do you mean

we have always perceived the maximum speed of the enterprise as a function of warp but i know now there are no limits we will explore new worlds that we could never before have reached in our lifetime

i will take us to them

captain i am picking up subspace distortion
mister data
this disturbance is the result of a highly charged graviton field emanating from our warp nacelles it is creating a severe bias in the subspace continuum
mister barclay are you responsible for this graviton field disturbance
yes sir im altering subspace in a way thats never been conceived of before im fairly certain it will allow us to travel halfway across the galaxy in a matter of only
mister barclay i want you to stop this experiment for now
captain if youd only allow me to show
mister barclay this is a direct order discontinue whatever it is youre doing
i really would rather not sir im positive that youll be pleased with the result once ive finished showing
audio is disconnected we may speak freely
how soon before the odn process is in place
i have been monitoring geordis progress it will be operational in seventeen minutes
captain let me go to the holodeck and try and talk to him
sir the subspace distortion continues to increase

hello deanna
reg
im sorry that we cant take that walk in the arboretum
so am i reg youve frightened all of us im sure that wasnt your intent
young children are sometimes frightened of the world that doesnt mean that their parents should let them stay in their cribs
are we children to you now
i can see so much more than you are capable of you should trust that deanna ive always wanted to earn your respect
youve got it from all of us we dont need any more convincing please obey the captains orders stop whatever it is youre doing
you must trust me
how can we trust an officer who doesnt follow orders
trust me
the captain will do everything in his power to stop you



picard to la forge status
ready captain
proceed
acknowledged
commander
what
youre too late

captain we have not regained control of the propulsion systems the odn bypass to the bridge has been blocked
barclay
yes commander riker

whatever it is youre doing out there youve got to stop it


sir were going in
mister barclay respond at once

audios disconnected
lieutenant take a security team to holodeck three disconnect mister barclay from the computer
aye captain


i want you to know lieutenant worf that i understand your duty in this matter
phasers maximum setting
and that i in no way will take your actions personally
conduits


la forge initiate stabilisation procedure
resetting stabilisers to match subspace flow matrix stand by
he is protected by a force field we could not disconnect him
mister data
we are experiencing a quantummodel oscillation delay doubling in intensity every twelve point three seconds biocellular disruption is imminent
sir

where are we ensign
unless somethings wrong with our sensors sir were almost thirty thousand light years from where we were
the centre of the galaxy
sir our headings been altered approaching planetary cluster
captain all systems are back under helm control the computer has returned to normal functioning

captain
emotive electrochemical stimulus response cranial plate bipedal locomotion endoskeletal contiguous external integument
im captain jeanluc picard of the federation starship enterprise
hierarchical collective command structure
who are you
interrogative
i am interrogative yes and i would appreciate an explanation
i think i can help you with that captain
mister barclay i thought it would be fatal if you left the holodeck
the cytherians have reintegrated me sir
cytherians
the probe was designed to instruct outsiders on how to reach this system the technologies arent always compatible they failed with the argus computer and with the computer on board the shuttle but they were able to reprogram me
what do you want of us
the same as you
mister barclay
youre both on the same mission captain
mission
yes sir the cytherians are exploring the galaxy just as we are the only difference is that they never leave their home they bring others here their only wish an exchange of knowledge they want to know us
captains log stardate  after ten days in the company of the cytherians the enterprise has been safely returned to federation space we bring back knowledge of their race that will take our scholars decades to examine lieutenant barclay is apparently no worse for his experience

so how much do you remember
i remember doing everything i just dont remember how or why
how do you feel now
smaller
just plain old barclay huh
always seems to come back to that doesnt it
you know almost everyone has a moment in their lives when they exceed their own limits achieve what seems to be impossible
the tricky part is what happens afterwards
you almost always feel a sense of loss but it is possible to carry something of that experience through the rest of your life in ways that you arent even aware of now
i think i know what youre saying
either way reg youre an important part of this crew in fact i could really use your help with that level three diagnostic
sure
excuse me commander but i believe mister barclay and i had a date scheduled for a walk in the arboretum

the diagnostic can wait ill see you later
you really you really dont have to do that
i know

may i checkmate in nine moves
i didnt know you played chess
i dont
qpid

captains log stardate  we have arrived at tagus three where the enterprise is to serve for host of the federation archaeology councils annual symposium i look forward to giving tomorrows keynote address with great anticipation

come
i thought youd like to know the council members have beamed aboard and been assigned their quarters
excellent
captain it really is quite late
tell me counsellor with regard to my lecture what do you think would provide greater clarity a chronological structure or the division of each excavations findings into various religious sociological and environmental subgroupings
i thought youd already decided on a chronological structure
there is something to be said for a more scientific approach
may i make a suggestion
by all means
relax youve written a brilliant speech
it will need to be tomorrow ill be addressing some of the greatest scientific minds in the federation switzer klarctarndroth mcfarland giants in the field of archaeology compared to them im just an enthusiastic amateur
i doubt they see of you as an amateur not when it comes to tagus three
well its true i have done my homework i have examined the findings of every archaeological expedition conducted on the planet surface
it is unfortunate that the taguans no longer allow outsiders to visit the ruins
indeed especially since we know so little about their origins but i think that i have constructed some plausible theories of my own
and im sure the council members will agree with you
your support is appreciated counsellor
now goodnight captain


bring back any memories
vash how did you get in here
i came in through the window



i had no idea you were a member of the archaeology council you are a member arent you
more or less
why did you come to tagus three
to see you of course
is that the only reason
isnt it enough
i wish i could believe you
i really have missed you jeanluc

excuse me

im sorry im late oh excuse me i didnt realise you had company
thats all right er allow me to introduce you this is beverly doctor beverly doctor beverly crusher this is vash shes a friend of mine from the archaeology council
i didnt mean to interrupt the captain and i often share morning tea together
yes i know jeanluc has told me all about you
really when was that
on risa where we met
i see that must have been during your vacation last year
no yes yes
well im surprised he never mentioned you
so am i doctor are you busy
not at the moment
i was wondering i would love to see some more of this marvellous ship
i would be delighted to show it to you
i er
that is if its all right with you jeanluc
of course
dont worry i promise to behave myself

and this is ten forward where the councils welcoming reception will be held today
well i cant think of a better location tell me does jeanluc come here often
not often the captain is a very private man would you like something to drink
please
eternity never looked so lovely
excuse me
i was referring to the view eternity never looked so lovely
you must be commander riker
im afraid you have me at a disadvantage
i didnt mean to interrupt i believe you were about to tell me that my eyes are as mysterious as the stars
youre betazoid
not at all its just that jeanluc does a very good imitation of you
he does
i see you two have met
not exactly
this is vash a member of the archaeology council and a friend of the captains
so ive gathered
they met during his visit to risa
on risa that vacation must have been better than he let on
you mean he never mentioned me to you either
doctor crusher please report to sickbay
im afraid i wont be able to finish our tour but perhaps commander riker could take over for me
it would be my pleasure

this is the main bridge the command centre of the enterprise and our last stop vash commander la forge
vash
hello
commander data
hello
how do you do
and this is lieutenant worf
hello
something wrong lieutenant
i had not been informed that council members had been granted bridge clearance
well i think we can make an exception in this case vash is a guest of the captain
welcome aboard
thank you is this where jeanluc sits
thats the big chair

well i can see where being a starship captain has its rewards
im that glad you approve
i suppose ill go back to my room now and get ready for the reception
by all means well i suppose ill see you then then
i look forward to it

fascinating woman

i dont understand i thought being the ships counsellor meant the captain confided in you
he does when he thinks its necessary
and he never spoke to you about me
not that i recall
not even a hint
you must understand the captain is a very
private man
i know excuse me
of course
nice legs for a human
jeanluc we need to talk
excuse me

the reception seems to be going well
forget the reception for a moment why have you never mentioned me to your friends
what would you have me tell them
maybe that we met for one thing that we had an adventure together some fun
it wouldnt be possible
why not
it would be inappropriate
i wasnt expecting you to go into intimate details
a captain does not reveal his personal feelings with his crew
is that a starfleet regulation or did you just make that up yourself
im sorry if youre upset
and im sorry if my being here embarrasses you

how was the reception
splendid

jeanluc its wonderful to see you again how about a big hug well dont just stand there say something
get out of my chair
oh and i was hoping for something more along the lines of welcome back q its a pleasure to see you again my old friend
were not friends
you wound me mon capitaine

there perhaps now your manners will show some improvement
what brings you here q have you been banished by the continuum once again
oh hardly theyre still apologising to me for the last time
then what is it you want
do i always have to have a reason to stop by i was merely in the sector i you force a confession from me the truth is i have a debt to repay
a debt
to you and it gnaws at me and it interferes with each of my days
i have no idea what youre talking about
without your assistance at our last encounter i never would have survived i would have taken my own life but for you
we all make mistakes
your good deed made possible my reinstatement in the continuum and i resent owing you anything so im here to pay up tell me what is it you wish and ill be gone
just be gone thatll do nicely
no no no no no it has to be something more more constructive thats my new word for the day
some other time q right now i have other matters to attend to
yes your speech i read it its dull plodding pedantic much like yourself i could help you with it
no thank you
youve never actually been to the ruins at tagus three have you
no they were sealed off more than a century ago
well that explains it then how can you write about something that youve never seen i know why dont i take you there

out of the question that would mean breaking taguan law
must you always be so ethical i suppose we could travel back in time you could see what tagus was like two billion years ago they really knew how to party back in those days
my answer is still no my lecture will have to stand on its own now will you please leave my ship
you are simply the most impossible person to buy a gift for

commander riker will you report to my ready room

yes captain
ive just been paid a visit from q
q any idea what hes up to
he wants to do something nice for me
ill alert the crew

captain

whos there
its me
who
jeanluc

yes
may i come in

let me try to explain i am by no means embarrassed by your presence here on the contrary

whats this a map of the ruins i thought that i was the only reason you came to tagus
i never fooled you for a second still you are the most important reason
am i
thats the trouble with being such a wellknown liar even when im telling the truth no one believes me

this equipment will have to be confiscated
is that necessary
if the taguans were to catch you down there
oh come on you gave me the same warning about sarathong five
i remember
well it didnt stop me from going there i brought back some very impressive artefacts too
which no doubt you sold for a very impressive profit
thats what i do
not on board my ship i will not allow it
lets get one thing straight though picard i cannot change who i am for you or anyone else
nor can i change who i am
then we have nothing more to say to one another
so it would seem



sleeping alone
im in no mood for your foolishness q
i knew there was something different about you you seem tense preoccupied somewhat smaller at first i thought it was that horrible lecture of yours but i was mistaken
whatever game you want to play will have to wait until tomorrow
i had such high hopes for you picard i thought you were a bit more evolved than the rest of your species but now i realise youre just as weak as all the others still it pains me to see the great jeanluc picard brought down by a woman
what woman
dont play coy with me captain i witnessed your little spat with vash nor will i soon forget the look of anguish on your face the pain the misery if i didnt know better i would have thought you were already married
you must be very bored q your imagination is running away with you
this human emotion love is a dangerous thing picard and obviously you are illequipped to handle it shes found a vulnerability in you a vulnerability ive been looking for for years if i had known sooner i would have appeared as a female mark my words picard this is your achilles heel
believe what you wish
do you deny that you care for this woman believe me id be doing you a big favour if i turned her into a klabnian eel
stay away from her q
i was just trying to help my debt to you
is hereby nullified i dont want your help your advice your favours or for that matter you do you understand once and for all
you would have me stand idly by as she lead you to your destruction
yes
as you wish


ladies and gentlemen members of the archaeology council welcome mystery it is the mystery of tagus three that brings us together today it is a mystery that has invited more argument more deduction more speculation than the best works of fiction and if youll excuse the conceit i want to tell you about my detective story for several years now i have been trying to unravel the secrets of tagus three

needless to say ive not succeeded

however i have i believe turned up some new information that if nothing else raises a whole new set of mysteries and i hope that we can discuss them here together

there have been nine hundred and forty seven known archaeological excavations conducted on the planets surface of those some seventy four are generally believed to have revealed findings of major importance

the earliest was some twenty two thousand years ago

what the hell

a heavily hollywoodisd version of the old ballads with picard as robin and the senior staff as the outlaws this is my local tradition and i personally
hate
the us messing with it
q
is this tagus three
i doubt there are many oak trees on tagus no i think this is supposed to be earth somewhere round about the twelfth century and this is england or to be more precise sherwood forest or at least qs recreation of it
that would explain these costumes
quite right number one or should i say john little
well if hes little john that makes you
i know robin hood
sir i protest i am not a merry man
on the contrary lieutenant worf your clothing identifies you with the character of will scarlett just as geordis mandolin identifies him as alan adale
and you mister data bear a striking resemblance to friar tuck

i have you at last robin hood

quick into the forest mister worf thats an order
enough you fools well never find them in the greenwood


ive managed to stop the bleeding

q its about time you showed up
i would prefer if you addressed me as his honour the high sheriff of nottingham
we will no longer share in this pointless fantasy of yours
fine stay here and do nothing by midday tomorrow your crew will be safely aboard their ship of course you will have to accept the consequences of your inaction
consequences
what is the one thing that robin hood is most famous for
he robs from the rich and gives to the poor
besides that
perhaps you are referring to the rescue of maid marian from nottingham castle
yes data and it just so happens that sir guy of gisbourne has decreed that marians head shall come off tomorrow at noon
vash
its your choice robin you can either take your ease in this sylvan glade or risk your life to save the woman you care nothing about
my feelings toward vash are irrelevant i would attempt to save any innocent life as you well know
yes but what about your merry men are you willing to jeopardise their lives as well is vashs life worth more than datas or trois or worfs you know worf youd make a perfect throw rug in nottingham castle
q i ask you to put and end to this before someone gets hurt
oh thats impossible you see ive given this fantasy as you call it a life of its own i have no more idea whats going to happen than you do but of one thing i am absolutely sure if you dare come to nottingham castle blood will be spilt

oh youll wear yourself out with all that pacing milady
i told you to stop calling me that the names vash
my poor lamb youve got a brain sickness for sure cant i get you something to ease your suffering
i could use a drink
well i wasnt thinking of spirits milady but i have some nice fresh leeches to drain the fever
out get out
oh her minds in an awful turmoil sir guy
who the hell are you
milady everyone in nottingham knows sir guy of gisbourne
sir guy of what
leave us

do not mock me lady marian im prepared to offer you one last chance to change your mind will you marry me

i see then the execution will proceed as scheduled
what execution
i warn you marian this pathetic attempt at feigning madness will not save your life
you mean im the one being executed sir guy wait a minute couldnt we talk this over i admit i havent been myself lately maybe weve both been a bit hasty please


sorry

data are you alright
the arrow impacted just above my sixth intercostal support penetrating my secondary subprocessor fortunately none of my biofunctions seem affected do not be concerned counsellor i believe your aim is improving
weve got to get out of here captain
not we number one i want you and the others to stay here until i return
youre not going to try to save her yourself sir
this is not a mission its personal its between q and myself i dont want the rest of you involved
captain
you have your orders commander and i expect you to follow them


a touch sharper shall we

such benevolence sir guy allowing the condemned prisoner fresh air
youre mistaken sheriff maid marian has promised to be my wife
what but thats impossible
not at all though i admit a maiden seldom has the opportunity to win herself such a noble husband
a toast to the most beautiful bridetobe in the whole of england
dont drink that it could be poison
have you taken leave of your senses
a foul scheme of robin hoods shes in league with him still ill warrant
robin hood oh robin hood oh well that was over long ago
all of nottingham knows youre still in love with him
thats a lie he bewitched me he put me under some evil spell
i suspected as much you can add sorcery to the list of charges against that rogue
sir guy if anyones been bewitched here its you
silence any more impudence and itll be your head on the block guard escort the lady marian to her chamber

but id much rather stay with you
of course you would my child but i have important business to attend to

lovely creature
intriguing



one step closer and ill scream
vash damn it its me
jeanluc oh am i glad to see you you wouldnt believe what ive been going through one minute im on the enterprise the next thing i know im here in nottingham first theyre going to chop my head off now im supposed to marry someone named sir guy and everyone insists on calling me marian

yes i know
you do but how youre robin hood
my staff and i were brought here by an old adversary of mine named q and ill tell you the rest of that once were safe come we dont have much time
and the others are outside
theyre waiting for us back at sherwood forest
you mean you came here alone
thats right now come on
what kind of plan is that
its an excellent one if youll just hurry up
you do realise our lives are at stake here
only too well
and this is the best strategy you could come up with one man against an entire castle
you have a better one
how about this you go ill stay here
and do what
marry sir guy if i have to
well thats brilliant
the drumhead

captains log stardate  for some weeks we have had a klingon exobiologist on board as part of a scientific exchange programme unfortunately we suspect that he was involved in a security breach and in the possible sabotage of our warp drive


what were you doing accessing the propulsion system files on stardate 
i didnt
yes you did from computer twelve b nine deck thirty six the computer logged in your identification from your communicator
it must be a mistake
jdan we have confirmed reports that schematic drawings of our dilithium chamber fell into romulan hands one week later
i know nothing about it
i suppose you know nothing about the explosion that disabled the warp drive at approximately the same time
no i was not involved you accuse me because i am klingon
our chief security officer is klingon that has nothing to do with it
send me home then if you are so distrusting
weve already contacted the klingon high council youll be returned home as soon as we finished our investigation
i have nothing more to say
very well worf accompany the lieutenant to his quarters

what do you think
its hard to tell he is very closed but he is hiding something

on the klingon home world your name is not mentioned it is as though you never existed a terrible burden for a warrior to bear to become nothing to be without honour without the chance for glory

i have friends powerful friends on the homeworld i could talk to them they might help to restore your name if you could just take me to a shuttlecraft

it could be done without any one knowing about it

i dont know how you transferred secret information to the romulans but i will find out
pahtk
when we inform the klingon high council they will put you to a slow death
captains log supplemental retired admiral norah satie whose investigation exposed the alien conspiracy against starfleet command three years ago is arriving to assist in our inquiry


captain picard
admiral satie welcome aboard the enterprise
delighted to be here i managed to acquire my former staff my aide sabin genestra from betazed and my assistant nellen tore from delb two
this is my first officer commander william riker may i show you to your quarters
captain if starfleet command is so concerned with your report they brought me out of retirement i think i should get right to work
very well commander riker will you see to the admirals staff
first id like to inspect the damage to your engine room

admiral satie this is commander data commander la forge
admiral we still cant get in there captain the radiation levels are dropping but theyre too high to raise the isolation door
how much longer will it be
at the rate the levels are decreasing we will gain entry in forty nine hours captain
maybe the admiral would like to see the visual log of the explosion
yes
this was logged four days ago at oh three hundred hours

at that point the emergency confinement field was activated and the isolation doors came down no one was killed but i have two people in sickbay with radiation burns
have you been able to make any assessments
slow motion study of the explosion suggests that the articulation frame collapsed
the schematics that were stolen from the enterprise i believe some involved the articulation frame of the dilithium chamber
thats one reason we tend to suspect sabotage
other evidence lends credence to that theory captain a review of the sensor logs indicates that every systems reading was well within normal parameters until fifty two milliseconds before the explosion
we havent found anything that suggests there was a malfunction anywhere along the line
captain i think im going to need a full briefing before we go any further
by all means admiral
commander data la forge i dont envy you your job good luck

there are disturbing overtones in the idea of a klingon providing information to the romulans are you aware of any other klingonromulan connection that starfleet command might have encountered recently
i dont believe what starfleet command knows or doesnt know is for me to reveal
this ship has encountered several incidents which might suggest a potential alliance between those two powers
were aware of that captain what we must concentrate on is the business at hand

come
excuse me captain i didnt know that
please mister worf come in i particularly want my guest to meet you admiral satie this is my head of security lieutenant worf
captain i have been pursuing the investigation of lieutenant jdan i believe i know how he transferred information off the enterprise
well done lieutenant
 this is jdans a hypospray he uses to treat his baltmasor syndrome but this has been fitted with an optical reader specially modified to read data from starfleet isolinear chips he can extract digital information from a computer encode it in the form of amino acid sequences and transfer those sequences into a fluid in the syringe then he injects someone perhaps even without their knowledge
or perhaps with their knowledge
the information would be carried in their bloodstream in the form of inert proteins
the body itself becomes a conveyor of top secret files lieutenant worf when we confront jdan i want you to conduct the interrogation
i would be honoured captain admiral

captain i predict that officer will be extremely valuable in this investigation

i have tracked the movements of every person who has left the enterprise since you have been here i traced one tarkanian diplomat as far as the cruces system where he disappeared and has not been seen since
that proves nothing
a hyposyringe was discovered in your quarters
i take injections everyone knows that
but your injections do not include an optical chip reader this device has but one function to transform computer information into biological sequences
the blood of all klingons has become water since the federation alliance we have turned into a nation of mewling babies romulans are strong they are worthy allies they do not turn klingons into weaklings like you
lieutenant how did you damage the dilithium chamber
i had nothing to do with that
you mean it was sheer coincidence that it was sabotaged after you gave the plans for the design to the romulans
i do not know i had nothing to do with it
youve admitted your crime why lie now
i am not lying
mister worf you may have him confined

sabin
i believe hes telling the truth he admits stealing the files but not sabotaging the dilithium chamber i get no sense that hes lying
but if youre right someone else may be involved
i think captain you have a bigger problem on your ship than one klingon exchange officer


ive seen this before the spectre of conspiracy on a starship is a frightening one
i can scarcely believe it myself but i am so grateful for your presence admiral if anyone in starfleet can help us its you
captain i find myself changing my mind about you
in what way
when starfleet ordered me here it was with the express command that we work together on this problem as equals my father taught me to avoid partnerships most of them are woefully lopsided
that sounds like judge aaron satie
you knew my father
only from his writings his judgments were required reading at the academy
he was an extraordinary man every night at the dinner table he would pose a question for debate my big brothers and i would wrangle it around from one side and the other father would referee and he kept a stopwatch on us so wed have to learn brevity but he wouldnt let us leave until he thought wed completely explored the issue
im willing to wager that you trounced your brothers during those debates
more than once father loved it when i nailed one of them with some subtle point of logic all that i am i owe to him he was a giant
you must miss him very much
captain i always preferred working alone that way if something goes wrong i dont have to go far for the cause i resented you being assigned to me but i was wrong were going to be quite a team

jdan did not make friends easily there are not many to question
youve done a thorough job lieutenant
i am strongly motivated in this matter
yes i can see that i dont mind telling you im surprised frankly when i first heard about your father
my father
yes there are some who believe he betrayed your people to the romulans
what he did or did not do is no ones concern but my own
of course i only meant before i saw you in action i naturally considered you a possible security risk but i want you to know you have the admirals and my complete confidence you have nothing to prove to us
if there is a conspiracy on board i promise you i will find it
good you know the ship you know the personnel you know exactly what were up against were counting on you lieutenant
i will arrange for the interviews to begin

and how often did lieutenant jdan come in for his injections
about once a week
did you administer them yourself
no
then who did
i had one of my assistants do that
did you ever hear him say anything anything that may have seemed innocent at the time that might now shed some light on this investigation
no nothing in fact he rarely spoke at all
thank you doctor crusher we appreciate your time you are excused now mister worf will you bring in the next person

please sit down mister tarses for the record will you tell us your name and position
simon tarses crewman first class medical technician
i assure you this is an informal inquiry we are not accusing you of anything however if you would like counsel it can be provided for you
no sir i have nothing to hide
tell me how long have you held your appointment onboard this vessel
since stardate 
mister tarses your records state that you were born on mars colony
thats right
then you are human
largely my paternal grandfather was vulcan
yes i see that tell me what is your relationship with the klingon jdan
er he i mean theres no relationship he just came in for his injections
did you give him those injections
sometimes there were several of us actually i might have done it twice
did he ever make any comments that might in retrospect be suspicious
not really he hardly ever talked
did you ever see him outside sickbay
once or twice in ten forward with a group of people but i never had a conversation with him
thank you mister tarses i dont think theres need for more captain
youre excused crewman

mister worf
wait hes lying hes desperately frightened hes covering something
its clear that hes frightened but thats hardly an indication
its more than that he wasnt truthful hes covering a lie one so big its overwhelming him i think weve found the man

admiral i have to tell you you must not expect me to permit any action against mister tarses solely on the basis of betazoid intuition
sabin has uncanny instincts ive learned to trust them
im not happy about this use of a betazoid
but you have a betazoid counsellor surely youre aware of the advantages
there is a difference between a counsellor and an investigator
are you saying you never use your counsellor during interrogations
yes i do but i would not act solely on the basis of her instinct
nor do i
but youre asking youre asking me to restrict mister tarses movements solely on the basis on sabins feeling
if counsellor troi suggested to you that someone on the ship were dangerous would you not act on that observe him curb his activity
yes i admit i probably would and perhaps i should reevaluate that behaviour
oh nonsense lets keep our priorities straight the important thing is to uncover the conspiracy on this ship and to prevent further damage now if tarses is a possible saboteur you cannot allow him access to sensitive areas of the ship and i strongly suggest continuous surveillance
if we had clear evidence
we will have clear evidence sabin and lieutenant worf are continuing to investigate but if you dont act until then it may be too late
no i wont treat a man as a criminal unless there is cause to do so
and while youre being so generous you give a saboteur a chance to strike again last time it was just a hatch cover what if next time its more serious what if lives are lost can you afford not to act
engineering to captain picard
yes mister la forge
captain could you come to engineering right away weve got something interesting to show you
ill be right there

captain we finally got in here about six hours ago weve been going over it inch by inch ever since
we have made microtomographic analyses of the dilithium chamber the hatch mounting the blast pattern from the explosion
we did mass spectrometer readings of the residue for chemical content sifted through the debris for bomb fragments
what did you find
this is the frame for the hatch it ruptured right along here when we take a reading of that spot see
im afraid im out of my element commander youll have to interpret for me
there are submicron fractures in the metal casing
thats right a breakdown of the atomic cohesive structure
yes and what caused them
those fractures suggest nothing more than simple neutron fatigue i would speculate that when the engine was last inspected at mckinley station the hatch casing was replaced with one which had an undetectable defect i believe sir that the conclusion to our investigation must be that the explosion was not intentional
thats the way i see it this wasnt sabotage at all it was nothing more than an accident

an accident i find that hard to believe
if my crew say there was no sabotage then you can be sure there was none
let us keep our perspective gentlemen just because there was no sabotage doesnt mean there isnt a conspiracy on this ship we do have a confessed spy
and he had confederates
do we know that for sure
of course he did do you think jdan could have come on board the flagship of the federation and accomplished what he did without help from within
i agree it would be difficult but not impossible
we should continue to investigate tarses he was hiding something
captain picard lieutenant worf and i have been working well together i suggest we continue if for no other purpose than to determine tarses innocence
now please let me remind you he is innocent until he is proved guilty
of course he is what sabin is saying is that he and lieutenant worf would like to establish his innocence unequivocally for his own sake
very well but let us put this to rest as quickly as possible


youve opened the hearing to spectators
it isnt good to have closed door proceedings for too long it invites rumour and speculation
nevertheless admiral i think it would be wise
because spies and saboteurs dont like the bright light of an open inquiry theyre like roaches scurrying for the dark corner
this hearing is convened on stardate  as a continuing inquiry into the activities of crewman simon tarses mister tarses for your own protection i have assigned a counsel to you in the person of commander william riker
thank you sir but i dont need protection i have not done anything wrong
doctor crusher have you observed crewman tarses with jdan
well yes he gave him his injection
i meant outside of sickbay
i think so perhaps in ten forward
and whom else have you observed at these occasions
i dont understand what relevance that has it was an innocent social gathering
if it was so innocent why do you hesitate to give us the names
thank you doctor  if you have a case to make against tarses you had better make it otherwise im stopping this here and now
mister tarses isnt it true that you have access to the biological supplies in sickbay
its part of my job yes
jdan used suspensions of deoxyribose to carry the encoded files he stole isnt it true one of your duties is to prepare those suspensions
several technicians share that job
and isnt it true that your security clearance allows you access to all the stores and files in sickbay access which you can exercise at any time
because i have access does not mean i
what would you say if i told you there is evidence that the explosion in the engine room was caused by a corrosive chemical one that is kept stored in sickbay
i had nothing to do with that
how can we believe you how can we believe someone whom we know we know to be a liar
i object there is no basis for calling crewman tarses a liar
agreed mister sabin
captain there is a basis which will become clear in a moment mister tarses didnt you deliberately and premeditatively lied when you filled out your personnel application and compounded that lie by repeating it to this committee
what
isnt it true that the paternal grandfather of whom you speak was not a vulcan but was in fact a romulan that it is romulan blood you carry and a romulan heritage that you honour

were waiting mister tarses
on the advice of my counsel i refuse to answer that question in that the answer may serve to incriminate me

you and crewman marcus will coordinate to track tarses movements over the last five years ensign kellogg i want a list of all relatives known associates and especially old school friends and make arrangements to do an encephalographic polygraph scan
mister worf
yes captain
i need to speak with you
you are dismissed please get your reports to me as soon as possible

do you see what is happening here mister worf
sir
this is not unlike a drumhead trial
i do not understand
five hundred years ago military officers would upend a drum on the battlefield sit at it and dispense summary justice decisions were quick punishments severe appeals denied those who came to a drumhead were doomed
but we know there is a traitor here jdan has admitted his guilt
thats true and he will stand for his crimes
tarses has all but done the same
how
he refused to answer the question about his romulan grandfather
that is not a crime worf nor can we infer his guilt because he didnt respond
sir if a man were not afraid of the truth he would answer
oh no we cannot allow ourselves think that the seventh guarantee is one of the most important rights granted by the federation we cannot take a fundamental principle of the constitution and turn it against a citizen
sir the federation does have enemies we must seek them out
oh yes thats how it starts but the road from legitimate suspicion to rampant paranoia is very much shorter than we think something is wrong here mister worf i dont like what we have become


there you are mister tarses would you care for some lemon
no thank you sir this is fine
well tell me a little about yourself crewman i know you were born on mars colony
yes sir all my life i wanted to be in starfleet i went to the academys training programme for enlisted personnel i took training as a medical technician and i served at several outposts the day that i was posted to the enterprise was the happiest day of my life
did you ever consider applying to the academy going the whole route apply to become an officer
my parents wanted me to and then i thought about it i used to sit under this big tree near the parade grounds
an elm tree with a circular bench
yes thats the one
i spent many an hour there it was my favourite spot to study
i used to sit under that tree and watch the drills picture myself an officer i know that it would have made my mother very happy but
you didnt do it
no i was eighteen and eager the last thing i wanted to do was spend four years sitting in classrooms i wanted to be out there travelling the stars i didnt want to wait for anything and now its done isnt it my career in starfleet is finished
not if you arent guilty simon
it doesnt matter i lied on my application and that mistake will be with me for the rest of my life


mister worf has found a brother who still lives on mars colony contact someone there and have him interviewed
admiral satie
and start a background check into all his friends at the academy training programme
admiral satie
yes captain
i would like to have a word with you
of course
in private and off the record
of course after all you are my partner in this

i cannot possibly believe you mean this
but i do this must stop it has gone too far you lied to him about the engine room there were no volatile chemicals found there
it was a tactic a way of applying pressure
we are hounding an innocent man
and how may i ask have you managed to determine that
ive talked with him
i see and he told you he was a victim of circumstance blameless and pure
no he admits his mistake in falsifying his application that does not make him a traitor
how can you be so incredibly naive captain may i tell you how ive spent the last four years from planet to starbase to planet i have no home i live on starships and shuttlecraft i havent seen a family member in years i have no friends but i have a purpose my father taught me from the time i was a little girl still clutching a blanket that the united federation of planets is the most remarkable institution ever conceived and it is my cause to make sure that this extraordinary union be preserved i cannot imagine why you are trying to block this investigation there have been others in the past who doubted me they came to regret it
the hearings on simon tarses will stop if necessary i will go to starfleet command
i have news for you captain ive been in constant contact with starfleet command the hearings are not going to stop theyre going to be expanded
what are you saying
im going to get to the heart of this conspiracy if it means investigating every last person on this ship and every hearing from now on will be held in the presence of admiral thomas henry of starfleet security ive requested he be brought here at once
you never told me about this
i report to starfleet command directly i do not need your permission or your approval for my decisions
admiral what youre doing here is unethical its immoral ill fight it
do what you must captain and so will i

captain warp engines are back online we are ready to commence restart sequences sir
yes yes yes of course proceed mister data
are you all right captain
yes of course number one just a little preoccupied
admiral satie has ordered you to report to the interrogation room at oh nine hundred hours tomorrow morning you are to be questioned before the committee
captains log supplemental admiral thomas henry who has worked closely with norah satie in the past has arrived to observe the hearings

your full name
jeanluc picard
rank and position
captain federation starship enterprise
how long have you held this post
for three years since stardate 
very well admiral
if you dont mind theres something id like to say
if you have a statement youll have an opportunity to make it later
i believe that chapter four article twelve of the uniform code of justice grants me the right to make a statement before questioning begins
very well
i am deeply concerned by what is happening here it began when we apprehended a spy a man who admitted his guilt and who will answer for his crime but the hunt didnt end there another man mister simon tarses was brought to trial and it was a trial no matter what others choose to call it a trial based on insinuation and innuendo nothing substantive offered against mister tarses much less proven mister tarses grandfather is romulan and for that reason his career now stands in ruins have we become so fearful have we become so cowardly that we must extinguish a man because he carries the blood of a current enemy admiral let us not condemn simon tarses or anyone else because of their bloodlines or investigate others for their innocent associations i implore you do not continue with this proceeding end it now
captain do you believe in the prime directive
of course
in fact its starfleet general order number one is it not
your point admiral
would it surprise you to learn that you have violated the prime directive a total of nine times since you took command of the enterprise i must say captain it surprised the hell out of me
my reports to starfleet document the circumstances in each of those instances
yes were looking into those reports captain very closely into those reports after which im sure well have more questions for you about your socalled commitment to starfleets prime directive
captain could you tell us just what happened on stardate 
i beg your pardon
let me refresh your memory you were transporting a vulcan ambassador tpel
i was following orders to take this ambassador to a location near the neutral zone
i dont think we need the preamble
in fact she was not a vulcan at all was she she was a romulan spy
thats correct
a spy whom you were delivering back into the hands of the enemy
tell me captain when the deception was revealed and she stood proudly on the bridge of a romulan ship did you make any effort to retrieve her
no
no even though you knew she carried federation secrets that shed been accumulating for years
the enterprise could have been captured by the romulans captain picard did the only thing he could
really lieutenant and where were you when this traitor was on board the enterprise where was ships security
dont you think its questionable judgment captain to have a security officer whose father was a romulan collaborator

lieutenant
tell me captain have you completely recovered from your experience with the borg
yes i have completely recovered
it must have been awful for you actually becoming one of them being forced to use your vast knowledge of starfleet operations to aid the borg just how many of our ships were lost thirty nine and a loss of life i believe measured at nearly eleven thousand one wonders how you can sleep at night having caused so much destruction i question your actions captain i question your choices i question your loyalty
you know there some words ive known since i was a school boy with the first link the chain is forged the first speech censured the first thought forbidden the first freedom denied chains us all irrevocably those words were uttered by judge aaron satie as wisdom and warning the first time any mans freedom is trodden on were all damaged i fear that today
how dare you you who consort with romulans invoke my fathers name to support your traitorous arguments it is an offence to everything i hold dear and to hear those words used to subvert the united federation of planets my father was a great man his name stands for integrity and principle you dirty his name when you speak it he loved the federation but you captain corrupt it you undermine our very way of life i will expose you for what you are ive brought down bigger men than you picard

i have nothing more to say
perhaps we should call a recess until tomorrow

am i bothering you captain
no please mister worf come in
it is over admiral henry has called an end to any more hearings on this matter
thats good
admiral satie has left the enterprise
we think weve come so far the torture of heretics the burning of witches its all ancient history then before you can blink an eye it suddenly threatens to start all over again
i believed her i helped her i did not see what she was
mister worf villains who wear twirl their moustaches are easy to spot those who clothe themselves in good deeds are well camouflaged
i think after yesterday people will not be as ready to trust her
maybe but she or someone like her will always be with us waiting for the right climate in which to flourish spreading fear in the name of righteousness vigilance mister worf that is the price we have to continually pay
half a life

counsellor deanna troi personal log stardate  my mother is on board

jeanluc you delicious man you were just thinking of me werent you
as a matter of fact
well think no further dear heart shes here
yes indeed
oh serious youre always so serious
lwaxana as a matter of fact i am rather busy at the moment
and youre always busy with something or other never the right thing though my daughter tells me that were picking up someone interesting here
yes the leading scientist of kaelon two and
oh kaelon two ive never heard of that
well lwaxana it is something of a rather delicate situation its the first real contact with a rather reclusive race and this is in the nature of an official greeting so
diplomacy i adore diplomacy everyone dresses so well

mister obrien energise

doctor timicin im jeanluc picard captain of the enterprise this is lieutenant commander la forge
i beg your pardon captain this is my first time aboard a federation starship oh yes they told me shaking hands a form of greeting
i beg your pardon doctor timicin allow me to present lwaxana troi of betazed shes also a guest on board and
and daughter of the fifth house holder of the sacred chalice of rixx heir of the holy rings of betazed and what are you doing for dinner
well i dont know really
lwaxana we have quite a bit of work planned
the mans never been on board a starship before jeanluc certainly somebody ought to make him comfortable before you get started
it seems that mrs troi is our acting ambassador of goodwill for today
you just think of me as your entertainment director

that man is in a lot of trouble
captains log stardate  for generations the people of kaelon two have been working to revitalise their dying sun the federation has offered to assist in testing what may be a solution to this problem

of course the basic theories of helium fusion enhancement have been discussed for over a century but theres been no practical method of application until now
the modifications that you have made to the torpedos guidance systems are remarkable doctor
well well see they still have to be proved but now at least its possible id never dared hope for such a perfect match with our own sun
my only regret is that it took us three years to find a suitable sun after you had first contacted us
were not used to dealing with other worlds were not used to asking for anything from others your offer of help has given us a possible means of survival it has taken forty years of my life to develop the programming that will control your photon torpedoes it has been my life thank you for this opportunity my only wish has been to find a way to revive our sun before i die

mrs troi i must protest your unauthorised presence on the bridge
what does that little one do mister woof
please madame that is a torpedo launch initiator and it is worf madame not woof

oh ah there you are dear whereve you been ive been waiting for you

so nice to see you again so soon
mrs troi
mother what did you want
what
you were waiting for me
oh yes dear of course i was you really must let me do something to relieve the tedium of all this work work work
im afraid im expected in engineering im really terribly sorry
mrs troi i have to ask you to clear the bridge please
i dont see why there are lots of other people here
mother please
well dont you worry well just have our little chat later

id never have thought her old enough to be your mother she is so vibrant


if you look at the next simulation youll see that we need the temperature to stabilise at two hundred twenty million before theres a secondary or tertiary reaction

enough is enough rescue is at hand doctor timicin would you clear all this mess from the table please
this mess mrs troi
now now now you boys have been shut up in here for hours now if you dont eat something youre going to get sick and whos that going to help ive made some perfectly marvellous mantickian pate mister homn will lay it out for us mister homn is my valet he doesnt say much
how can he
it is true that the intellectual efficiency of high order beings does diminish proportionately with the deprivation of nutritious fuel or
all right all right dont you start
mrs troi youre a wise woman im sure we could use a respite
these two call me mrs troi you call me lwaxana mister homn spread it

so knowing that my daughters starship would be passing fairly close to betazed again i manoeuvred a ride and here i am deck eight
i also have a grown daughter she has a small son of her own
then youre married
my wife died quite some years ago

you know one thing i dont understand if your people have known for generations that their sun is dying why not simply evacuate the planet
it is our home it defines who we are as a people if kaelon two ceases to exist so do we
then you definitely should fix it
with the federations help i hope we will
and the federation will be pleased to offer whatever help it can

would you come in for a nightcap
thats extremely kind of you but
my valet sleeps elsewhere
you are delightful you make me laugh i mean i dont mean your invitation makes me laugh i mean i took it quite seriously i mean
just say yes ill make you laugh some more
i wish i could but i must say no goodnight lwaxana
captains log stardate  the enterprise has arrived at the praxillus system where we will conduct doctor timicins helium ignition test


mother how much
little one why do you refuse to use telepathy even when we are alone
were not alone mother now how much longer is this going to take youve been selecting for twenty minutes
i am a woman dressing for a man something you might try now and then dear i wonder if timicin likes green
thats not very telepathic of you
oh i tried telepathy on him hes the wrong species right species for everything else though you might try that once in a while too
you know youre not just incorrigible youre insatiable

i have completed long range scans there are no other life forms are present in this system
spacecraft
none within sensor range

mister la forge the system is clear
final prelaunch diagnostic level five
all systems verified
were ready here when you are captain

very well mister worf
photon torpedoes armed and targeted
fire in sequence
first volley released
tracking torpedoes entry programme confirmed
second volley released

torpedoes now entering the stellar core
their shields are holding guidance systems normal
ignition sequence six seconds

five seconds four

three seconds now shock wave patterns within predicted range seventeen hundred percent rise in gamma radiation levels helium fusion rate increasing
what about heat and pressure levels
steady so far density at eleven hundred grams per cubic centimetre temperature approaching sixty million degrees kelvin
we want it to stabilise at two hundred and twenty million

pressure wave harmonics dispersing temperature in target zone increasing to eighty one million degrees sir
still rising

temperature at ninety million degrees kelvin and now one hundred ten million looking good one hundred thirty seven

radiation and pressure levels still stable
temperature is one hundred and seventy million degrees kelvin

one ninety and now two hundred million
its happening
two oh seven and rising two nineteen and twenty two twenty and holding looks like congratulations may be in order

mister data
turbulence patterns are within predicted parameters


two twenty two

temperature is rising in the core again captain two hundred and thirty million degrees kelvin
still rising captain

two fifty one

rate exceeding critical level core density is becoming unstable
lets get the hell out of here
ensign warp two now


sorry
captain picard
doctor
permit me to express my appreciation to you and your crew i am most grateful most grateful

ensign lay in a course for kaelon two warp factor five
aye sir


im so sorry timicin i had one of those named after me once brilliant young astronomer from rigel four of course i sparkled a bit myself in those days you see thats called fishing for a compliment youre supposed to tell me i still sparkle im sorry im not helping am i
youre very kind im just not adequate company right now
oh thats all right i can make enough conversation for both of us ill leave you alone
no please stay i wanted to tell you how much i wish we had met years ago
what difference do a few years make
unfortunately a great deal you see lwaxana im on my way home now to die
captains log stardate  we have returned to kaelon two and established contact with science minister btardat

the experiment achieved a stable core temperature for a short time minister thats a significant step forward
weve been studying the sensor logs and the torpedo telemetry to determine if there was any malfunction if there was and we are able to isolate the problem another test might be successful in the meantime all of our facilities would be made available to doctor timicin
a most thoughtful and generous offer but timicin has obligations at home and it would take us some time to select a replacement
we would be more than willing to extend our visit sir
that will not be necessary well contact you as soon as were ready we expect timicin to return home as soon as possible and again gentlemen many thanks

come

are you aware these people you are so graciously helping are murderers
i beg your pardon
well the next thing to it when a person on this benighted little planet reaches the age of sixty which timicin is about to do theyre expected to simply kill themselves did you know that
mister data
the people of kaelon two are isolationists almost to the point of being xenophobes regrettably we know very little about their customs
well i know timicin himself just told me he is supposed to go down there to his loving friends be wined dined honoured for his achievements and then kill himself its a barbaric ritual the resolution its called obviously you cant let him go jeanluc
im afraid i have no choice
i dont think youve been listening to me the man is supposed to kill himself you dont just let that happen you dont just turn your back whats the matter with you
lwaxana im sorry but whatever my personal feelings i have no jurisdiction here i simply cannot interfere
but you have to in a situation like this you absolutely have to interfere youve got to go down there and talk to those people jean luc open their eyes educate them
the prime directive forbids us to interfere with the social order of any planet
well thats your prime directive not mine

computer locate counsellor troi

what do you mean i cant go down there are you telling me that im a prisoner on this ship
mother whats going on what are you doing
im sorry counsellor im not sure what to do here
well i am sure i am a betazoid ambassador im a daughter of the fifth house and those people are going to answer to me so you just energise this damned thing and get me down there
he cant mother he has his orders
his orders dont apply to me
no they apply to him
dont you try your professional patronising on me young lady they expect timicin to die dont you realise that just because hes sixty whats sixty its nothing

ill go check the pattern buffers

come on mother lets sit down
im sorry little one i dont know whats wrong with me im sorry
theres no need to be
but im crying i dont cry
you cried when father died
you remember that
of course i remember we both cried
but this isnt the same is it
what do you think
i dont know i just cant accept that fate will allow me to meet him like this and then take him away i mean hes not ill he hasnt had a tragic accident hes just going to die and for no good reason because his society has decided that hes too old so they just dispose of him as though his life no longer had value or meaning you cant possibly understand at your age but at mine sometimes you feel tired and afraid
youre feeling very vulnerable very mortal if i may say so i know you mother and believe me you will never be one of those who dies before they die

come in

ive been studying the preliminary reports of the test i dont understand where i went wrong i thought id taken into account all of the variables deep convection patterns proton reactions neutrino count

i will say it again you are a kind woman
no no im a hateful woman i hate what youre going to do and i hate you for doing it
it is the way of my world i wish you could accept that
i never will never


how long have you been sitting there
i dont know a minute an hour
lwaxana
do you want anything some tea
i want to explain i want very much for you to understand fifteen or twenty centuries ago we had no resolution we had no such concern for our elders as people aged their health failed they became invalids those whose families could no longer care for them were put away in deathwatch facilities where they waited in loneliness for the end to come sometimes for years they had meant something and they were forced to live beyond that into a time of meaning nothing of knowing they could now only be the beneficiaries of younger peoples patience we are no longer that cruel lwaxana
no no youre not cruel to them you just kill them
the resolution is a celebration of life it allows us to end our lives with dignity
a celebration of life it sounds very noble very caring what youre really saying is you got rid of the problem by getting rid of the people
it may sound that way but it is a time of transition one generation passing on the responsibilities of life to the next
what about the responsibility of caring of the elderly
that would place a dreadful burden on the children
we raise them we care for them we suffer for them we keep them from harm their whole lives eventually its their turn to take care of us
no parent should expect to be paid back for the love theyve given their children
well why the hell not  oskoids
whats that
 oskoids a betazed delicacy
looks very interesting
you should have tried it while you were still alive no reason to bother now why sixty why not sixty two or fifty eight
a reasonable age had to be set
but its not reasonable certainly not in your case youre as vital and healthy a man as ive ever known
that is why i wish to say goodbye to my family and colleagues while i am this way in complete command of my faculties knowing they will always remember me as a strong and vigorous man
but it makes no sense some of your people could still be active at seventy or eighty and others might be seriously ill at fifty how cruel of you to make them wait so long to commit suicide
setting a standard age for the resolution makes it uniform for everybody to ask individual families to decide when their elders are to die that would be heartless
i agree why not let everybody die when they die
lwaxana
you have a grandson you said
yes almost seven
well wouldnt it be better for him to know his grandfather not some vague memory of someone who once loved him but a real living person who does love him dont you really think that would be better
i attended the resolution of my parents when it was their time it was beautiful lwaxana this is a custom ive known and accepted all my life
the women of betazed used to wear these enormous wigs with large holes in the cenre for tiny caged animals
yes
first it was a fashion then it went on long enough to become a custom a tradition but it was uncomfortable for the woman and cruel to the animal so then one day one very formidable woman finally said so refused ever to wear another of those wigs fairly soon the custom stopped she had the courage to stand up and fight for change
she must have been a lot like you
timicin there is no one more qualified more experienced or more likely to save their planet than you and they would have you kill yourself
younger scientists will take my place my work the work will continue
your planet has what thirty forty years left what if your scientists cant find the answer without you what then what chance do you think your grandson has of reaching the age of sixty
enough please it is my time lwaxana and that is the way it is
if thats the way it is i dont know why anyones bothering to try to save your world at all if its time has come let it die wheres the difference timicin where

convection boundary uncoupling the reaction caused gas turbulence of a totally unexpected magnitude why
there was a evidence of a delayed surface shock
no id anticipated that i thought id anticipated all possible variables but stars theyre like living entities in a way quite unpredictable you know i wouldnt be at all surprised if this were the result of look here forty two seconds into the test there is a sudden rise in the level of hydrogen alpha emissions and here heres another im right arent i there had to be neutron migration within the stars inner core as the reaction grew
perhaps doctor but there is no known method for controlling a neutron migration
yes yes but theoretically it is possible using these test results we could construct a new computer model of the energy dynamics of a star that can test a new detonation programme im certain it can be accomplished certain its just a matter of time a matter of time

come timicin time for you to leave us then
captain i have come to officially request asylum aboard the enterprise

timicin i cannot believe this why asylum asylum from what
i turn sixty in four days minister
yes and your family and colleagues are already gathering for your resolution
i believe that it is time for us to reexamine as a people the wisdom of the resolution
are they forcing you into this are you being coerced
influenced perhaps coerced no
our only influence minister is by example timicins decision is his own free will i assure you
i cannot believe that a man of timicins stature would freely choose to reject his own culture
no one on kaelon two understands this project as i do there are new theories that would take others a decade to test and confirm with my guidance it can be done in half that time i must finish my work
others started your work others will finish it its always been this way it always will
captain scanners indicate two kaelon warships rising on an intercept course
acknowledged commander minister were here in friendship hoping to provide assistance
you have helped quite enough captain i suggest you return timicin and depart if you attempt to leave orbit with timicin on board our ships have been ordered to open fire
btardat theres no purpose at all in letting this become

it shouldnt have happened ive handled this poorly
you acted in good conscience doctor i dont see what else you could have done
i could have let well enough alone i could have returned home what do you think captain have i done the right thing
im afraid youre the only one who can answer that
lwaxana would have me lead a revolt im only a scientist i wish i had her strength she is a woman of extraordinary conviction isnt she
isnt she

any communication number one
no sir we have an open channel
the warships are taking a standard attack posture staggered approach vectors within weapons range
shields up red alert
captain
doctor i suggest that you return to your quarters
i dont want there to be any bloodshed because of my decision
they will be doing everything they can to avoid it i think we should get out of their way now
yes yes of course i understand
mister worf ascertain their offensive potential
aye sir

we must transmit the new analysis of the neutron migration immediately if i can make them see the direction ive taken
weve already tried
they refuse to accept further reports from you doctor
they have to accept them if i can reestablish computer interface with the science ministry
theyve disengaged the linkup doctor
why dont they answer even if i find the solution you will not accept it because i do not terminate my life they terminate my work alive i am a greater threat to my world than a dying sun

but jeanluc will find a way to settle this he always does
no my decision will only lead to more distrust of other worlds nothing will change
now dont be foolish
i am not being foolish lwaxana i want to live because i see in you how much i have to live for you make me realise that my life still has value i can be an example to my people i can finish my work but discovering these new desires and not being able to do anything about them not being able to finish my work not being able to reach my people
you have made a statement about the sanctity of life and it will be heard timicin
who will hear it from light years away where will i go now lwaxana im a man without a world i cant go home
timicin
bridge to doctor timicin you have a visitor coming aboard
btardat

no sir its your daughter

dara

father
this is lwaxana troi she has been a host and a friend
ive been looking forward to meeting you dara
whatever you have to say to me can be said in front of her
i see father come home this is wrong
dara if i could show you the work i have begun theres still so much for me to do
theres nothing for me to look at it is irrelevant
your fathers work may save your world my dear i would hardly consider that irrelevant
all im concerned with now is you not your work your work is over it is your time to rest
perhaps you will feel differently as you get a little older say approaching sixty
my father taught me to cherish the resolution i dont know how you have poisoned him to reject it
its an obscene ritual
how dare you how dare you criticize my way of life my beliefs
please please dara please
where will you go
i dont know
and where will you die i cannot bear the thought of you being laid to rest on some other world that you will not lie beside my mother that i will not be able to lie beside you when my resolution comes im sorry i dont know how you can go on with your life knowing that each day you live is an insult to everything we believe in father i love you but i am ashamed

i would like to be alone now please

i am suddenly suddenly not sure of myself its a feeling im not at all used to i dont think i like it very much little one
not sure of yourself
my life has been full now and then perhaps its overflowed a little but i enjoy living and now i am asking myself is it possible i was wrong to encourage timicin to choose life
you were honest with him mother you had to be
maybe i want him to live just to keep me company
of course you do but you didnt do this for yourself you did it for him
did i then look what ive done to him hes like a man whos lost his faith i never considered how deeply ingrained this resolution liturgy is
ritual provides a structure in society good rituals and bad rituals alike
well this is a bad one
your point of view
it should be the point of view of any reasonably intelligent middleaged person unfortunately it is not

ill see you later mother excuse me
thank you

youre going back
do you believe i love you i do you know but finally if that is my only reason to stay alive
its not enough
almost almost but not quite i cant be that selfish lwaxana i am not the person to lead the revolt

i do apologise for all the turmoil ive created
doctor i would deeply regret it if you were returning only to ease diplomatic tensions
it is more much more
then i wish you and your people well
when it is time for another test i will encourage my people to seek your assistance again
if for any reason you would like to wait a few minutes
no we have already said our goodbyes

lwaxana
it is the custom for your loved ones to join you at this resolution is it not
you do not have to do this
yes i do permission to disembark captain i promise i wont cause any problems down there
permission granted

were ready mister obrien
the host

doctor beverly crusher personal log stardate  began an analysis today of the respiratory problems being experienced on the beta moon of peliar zel finally got an actual letter from wesley topped the class in exobiology but hes still struggling in ancient philosophies and theres someone new in my life


ambassador odan doctor crusher i was just on my way to speak to you
hello data
i have completed my study on the atmospheric variations which have occurred on the moon since the new technology was implemented
thank you commander that will be most helpful in my efforts to mediate the quarrel
i could go over it with you now it would not require more than two hours
we do appreciate that data but the ambassador and i have set aside this time to analyse the incidence of the lung disease on the moons inhabitants
then it is perfect timing doctor what better occasion to integrate my results into your study
now that i think about it youre absolutely right commander unfortunately im not feeling very well perhaps doctor crusher could get you started inputting your information i myself must return to my quarters
ambassador are you still having those awful headaches id better bring you a hypospray to take care of it
i would be most grateful
okay


put a cold cloth on your forehead ambassador ill do my best to be with you shortly

ill set you up at the medical monitor data itll take you a while to input the figures wont it
at least an hour but i do not believe much time can be saved by exhibiting such haste now
data there are times when every second does count



somehow i had an unnatural fear that data was going to barge in and ask to discuss the peripheral effects of magnetospheric energy taps
well if i dont get back soon and take a look at his projections he just might come looking for me
do you know when i first met the formidable doctor beverly what ten days ago i thought to myself this woman is ice through to her bones who would have ever guessed that instead of ice there is fire
odan
stay here dont go
odan are we is this interfering with your work on the peliar zel problems
fortunately ive done about as much as i can until we get there because i just cant seem to keep my mind on my work right now
odan i have to go
promise me well be together tonight
i promise

then you may go doctor beverly
its just beverly
not just beverly its beverlys smile its her kindness her beauty within and without so much more than just beverly
picard to ambassador odan

yes captain this is odan
the federation representative from peliar zel has come on board would you care to meet us in the observation lounge

ill be right there captain

if the news were encouraging i assume you would not be here
im afraid youre correct captain the situations growing progressively worse

whereve you been
with a patient minor emergency

ambassador odan this is governor leka trion of peliar zel
ambassador thank you for coming i knew your father his efforts helped keep our people at peace for several generations
i would hope to serve you as well as he
governor ambassador

i hope doctor crusher was able to help you with your headache
thank you actually she was
governor leka has intercepted us before we reach her planet in order to update us on the situation
the people on our moons have been in discord ever since they migrated from our planet five centuries ago to us on the planet theyre like two squabbling children we try to help settle their arguments by not taking sides but this time we are at a loss
ive been studying the information you sent if i understand correctly the people of alpha moon have found a way to tap directly into the magnetic field of your planet and now rely exclusively on that energy source
yes but the beta moon is now suffering some environmental damage as a result

my design models suggest that beta will eventually experience rising temperatures erratic tide surges and in general the beginnings of global warming
the impact on the health of the betan people is clear there will be profound medical repercussions
alpha is unwilling to give up its newfound energy source beta accuses them of intentionally courting genocide our efforts to reach a compromise have failed and now we have received intelligence that both sides are arming for war if that happens the people of my planet will begin to take sides and the outcome can only be disastrous
we will be in orbit around peliar zel within six hours if you could arrange for the representatives of alpha and beta to be there then ambassador odan could beam directly down to the planet
excuse me captain i prefer to shuttle to the surface
i would not recommend it there are many radical factions involved in this dispute it would be difficult to guarantee your safety
im sure im not the first who has expressed discomfort at the idea of molecular transport thank you but i prefer to remain intact ill shuttle down
as you wish

counsellor what is it
its ambassador odan i continually feel fluctuations of emotion from him
perhaps its perfectly normal among the trill
it could be we know so very little about them
yes quite


hi deanna
hi is that the colgonite astringent you have on your eyes
yes i guess so
ive never tried it
someone just put it on me
i didnt know you even came in here
i dont at least not very often
but it feels good to indulge yourself sometimes
i guess so
especially when you havent done so in a while
what is that supposed to mean
beverly youre in love
sometimes i wish you werent so empathic
i dont really think its really a secret
it isnt
youve been glowing
oh must be the astringent what
nothing
oh yes there is what is it
its just something i sense in odan
what what do you sense
its just how well do you really know him
i feel i know him better than ive known anyone in my life am i being foolish i dont think so and yet ive only known him for a couple of weeks of course that could be infatuation but i am a grown up and i know the difference between love and infatuation all i know is i havent felt this way for a long time
and you like it
i like it

come
you wanted to see me captain
yes ambassador please sit down we have entered orbit we shall be transporting you to the planet in a few minutes
i am ready captain
how will you proceed when youre there
oh i cannot answer that i never know until i am into the situation meet the people involved i work very much by instinct not by prearranged plan
it seems to work well for you
well i do like to go into a situation as wellinformed as possible and i must say that your staff has been quite helpful in briefing me on the problems down here particularly doctor crusher
my staff is quite capable im glad theyve been useful
your doctor beverly is an extraordinary person both as a scientist and as a woman
yes im sure thats true well shall we make our way to the shuttlebay
captain you know her better than i do you have any idea how committed she is to remaining with starfleet
i wouldnt presume to speak for her
oh no of course not i just thought well youve known her so much long than i
ensign taggart to captain picard
yes ensign
the shuttle is ready to transport the ambassador
very well
ill find my own way captain i hope to return with good news

commander riker has asked to pilot you himself ambassador
i am honoured

i dont know when ill be back
i know have a safe trip
i will stay safe doctor beverly i have good reason to return ive researched earth customs this flower is given to express love

yes it is

initiate shuttle preflight sequence
preflight underway counting to clearance
shuttle has cleared the bay door
commander riker you will be out of shield range in five seconds
acknowledged

lieutenant well be entering the upper ionosphere in two minutes and twenty seconds

sir an unidentified ship is emerging from the limb of the moon
hail the vessel
i have visual contact i dont recognise it
it claims to be an escort vessel from the beta moon
there was no mention of an escort request a security clearance code
they do not answer sir
commander riker prepare to return to the shuttlebay
acknowledged
captain they are loading its phaser banks

increasing power to the shields

coming about


engage tractor beam report number one
weve lost port thrusters

and both backup stabilisers im losing control
were bringing you in

captain the shuttle hull has been weakened were breaking up you cant tow us youd better beam us directly on board
no dont do it
i cant stabilise the shuttle
if you transport me it will kill me please
number one were ready to beam you aboard
belay that order captain ill bring her in manually

advise doctor crusher we have a medical emergency

hes in shock hes lost a lot of blood but that still doesnt explain these readings eosinophilia in the cerebrospinal fluid at forty six percent
sedimentation rate is twenty nine but his lymphocytes are still intact
its as though theres a parasite at work odan odan i need to do exploratory surgery you may have a parasitic infection
you must not
but you wont survive

what is that
beverly that is me
what
this body is just a host i am that parasite that is what must survive it has always been this way the trill are a joined species a host and a symbiont and in this fashion we have survived for millennia
youre dying what can i do
the host body is dying you must contact the trill quickly tell them i need another host they will send a replacement i know this is difficult to accept but i beg you doctor beverly help me this mission must be completed

odans host body died of the injuries just over an hour ago but the symbiont being odan is still alive odan is the one who negotiated the last treaty but the man everyone thought was his father was just another host body
and the reason odan refused the transporter
it would have damaged the symbiont
weve contacted the trill another host will be here in forty hours
ive placed odan in stasis he can survive another hour maybe two but not beyond that
would it be possible for me to serve as a temporary carrier
no data the relationship requires a biological being
we are at a desperate impasse in the peliar system the attack on the shuttlecraft has inflamed the dispute
who was responsible
no one will admit anything each side accuses the other and the threats are mounting we need odan
doctor could a human host carry him
i believe so from odans description of the process it should be possible but i dont have
then i volunteer
theres been no precedent for a human host i couldnt guarantee what might happen
the risk is too great commander
weigh it against the prospect of war
its your choice will
lets get to it

ive given you a local anaesthetic you must be conscious during the implantation drugs might damage the symbiont
i understand
laser scalpel

how do you feel is there pain
no just some strange sensations
vital signs
heart rate one hundred ten blood pressure ninety over forty
i cant close yet the assimilations not complete
pulse one thirty and climbing eeg is erratic
hes going to start fibrillating two hundred milligrams of metrazene
yes doctor
hang on will
weve got incorporation doctor
im closing
brain waves are still irregular
the metrazene should have stabilised him ill give it ten seconds more before we go in again
here we go eeg approaching regular
blood pressure levelling off
thats better signs are returning to normal will its beverly can you hear me
hello
youre going to be all right how do you feel
im fine you look a little tired doctor beverly

i know this must be disturbing governor but you must convince the inhabitants of the moons that i am odan i have his skills his thoughts his memories
they will perceive you as a starfleet officer perhaps with your own agenda
the man they knew as my father the man who stands before them both are merely hosts it is your task to help them understand
i will try i cannot promise they will listen they are more factionalised than ever listening is a skill which seems to have evaporated with the heat of argument
speak softly governor those who cannot hear an angry shout may strain to hear a whisper
i will do what i can

well done mister worf will you escort the ambassador to his quarters
im just a little dizzy ill be fine i just need to lie down
picard to doctor crusher
yes captain
doctor the ambassador is not well will you please attend to him in his quarters
right away sir

white cell count is elevated six tenths of a degree of temperature but no sign of rejection
thats good
you look awfully pale
just a little weak and lightheaded
cerebral blood flow looks normal ill leave you a metabolic booster use it if the symptoms get worse
beverly
beyond that i dont know what to do this is all new to me
it is new to me as well please dont go weve got to talk about this
i dont know what to say
nor do i but i know that this silence will injure us
well maybe you should have thought about that sooner maybe you should have told me what you were it didnt seem to bother you to remain silent yesterday
it never occurred to me this is what i am did you ever tell me that you are only a single being of course not that was normal to you
i dont know who you are
you must understand whoever i seem to be i am odan who loved you that has not changed i still love you i cant help that if this causes you pain i will suppress it i will keep my distance doctor beverly i would never hurt you

may i join you
you know deanna the first man i ever loved unconditionally was named stefan he was a soccer player and i would watch him as he would race down the field and i thought my heart would stop because he was so beautiful we married and had three children twin boys andrew and alexander and then later a little girl jennifer stefan became an artist very famous he created huge breathtaking metal sculptures he came to adore me as much as i worshipped him in my daydreams at least stefan was eleven and i was eight he never even knew i existed oh deanna i loved odan im sure of it i had no doubts no fears but what it was i loved his eyes his hands his mouth theyre gone if that was all it was i should mourn him and go on but it was more than that i felt completely free with him unguarded at ease with myself there were so many things that made him special to me where are they are they still here alive in will riker i look at will and i see someone ive known for years a kind of brother but inside is he really odan help me please
what do your feelings tell you
i feel his pull its very powerful i wish hed never come on this ship
dont wish that beverly you cant be open to love if you dont risk pain
i dont care id give anything not to feel the way i do now hes here isnt he
look at him
i dont want to look at him talk to me just keep talking to me
the first man i ever loved was my father he was strong and tall he carried me when the ground was muddy he chased away the monsters that hid under my bed at night and he sang to me and kept me safe and he went away what i wouldnt give to hear those songs again to feel his arms protect me i never will but i can still feel his warmth and his love as though he were here with me if you can feel those things from the man we know as will riker accept them accept the love
captains log stardate  representatives of the two moons of peliar zel have agreed to come on board to meet the new ambassador odan

white count is elevated its getting higher and higher every time i read it are you in pain
not much
ambassador we can stall the representatives
they would see that as deception i must meet with them
but surely to present yourself in this condition is not going to help our cause
i promise you captain they will never know that i am ill
captain the emissaries
may i present kalin trose of alpha moon and lathal bine of beta moon
thank you for receiving us captain
is this ambassador odan
lathal bine it was your aunt who represented beta thirty years ago
that is correct
she was a formidable woman i had the utmost respect for her
and who was it who spoke for alpha so long ago
that was you of course kalin trose then you were a young man bristling with passion and zeal yet wise enough to understand that your people needed peace to ensure their future
and how did you manage to achieve a compromise between that young man and the iron willed woman of beta moon
they agreed to trade places for a week to understand each others situation with more informed eyes after that an agreement came swiftly
nothing that you have said is beyond what a school child could learn in a history book
what is not commonly known that during those negotiations you kalin trose quelled a plot by a radical from your moon who was attempting to assassinate the beta delegate
it is true
perhaps he was wiser in his youth than he is now odan you must convince him to stop
will you accept me will you allow me to work with you
yes
and alpha moon
i will consider it but i must consult others
this is a typical tactic he is an obstructionist you can see that
kalin trose you may confer with your people but we must have your answer within eight hours
you shall have it

his vital functions are overworked his immune system is under attack i can only guess that hes suffering from classic rejection syndrome
is there any treatment you can give him
i can administer an immunosuppressant that could help relieve the symptoms but it cant correct the underlying cause there is a foreign organism in his body medical school didnt exactly prepare me for situations like this
youre doing all you can
dont worry about me captain im fine
ambassador when you feel up to it would you join me in my ready room
of course

im giving you something that should help with the pain at least for a little while
the pains gone thank you

please dont
please let me touch you just for a moment

no please

it was a fast decision which we must take as positive the alphan representative has agreed however reluctantly to let you mediate the dispute
i knew they would they are reasonable people theyre just trapped in their own anger
i have no doubt however that they will bolt if something goes wrong in the discussion
then its my job to see nothing goes wrong did i said something wrong captain picard
no its just that for a moment you sounded more like will riker we have received information that the new host will arrive in eighteen hours will you be all right until then
the medication doctor beverly gave me has helped i will find a way to keep going

lemon tea

computer location of doctor beverly crusher
doctor crusher is in her quarters
can you make balso tonic
there is no formula on record please supply a molecular structure
never mind

come in
i thought i should see how you were doing if you needed another hypospray
i dont think so the symptoms havent returned
oh well thats good
yes
tomorrows an important day do you feel ready for it
ill be fine ive been preparing
thats good
yes
ill check your vital signs in the morning before the representatives get here
i dont want them knowing im taking any medication
maybe you could schedule a series of breaks
thats good
yes
beverly i want you if youre going to leave youd better go right now
im not leaving
captains log stardate  governor leka and the representatives of the two moons are ready to transport on board we have learned that they each have troops massed and are ready for combat if this final effort at peace is not successful

white count is back up temperature is elevated the effects of the medication are wearing off faster every time ill administer one now and hope that it will hold for an hour or two
no no more
ambassador its clear youre in pain you cant get through the next hours without help
i must
are the injections damaging to the hosts body rikers body
yes we cant put him through any further risk
but how can you function conduct the meeting
ill manage
well respect your wishes
one more thing i will conduct the mediations today but at the end of today regardless of the outcome i must be removed from rikers body even if the new host has not arrived
but you wouldnt survive
riker will not survive if i am removed he has done enough your word
very well
worf to captain picard
yes mister worf
the governor and the two representatives have returned i will escort them to the observation lounge
thank you

ill stand by with the medication just in case the pain may become so intense that ill have to
beverly whatever else i may be to you i am your friend i can only imagine what youre going through and i want you to know im here

jeanluc

computer what is the time
fifteen thirty five hours
theyve been in there for almost six hours
captain i am receiving a message from the ship carrying the trill host
are they here worf
no they are experiencing difficulty they do not anticipate their arrival for another nine hours
nine hours

it was worth it

ambassador
they will not go to war
mister worf see that the representatives are safely transported off the ship ensign set a course to intercept with the trill ship prepare to go to warp nine
sir it could take more than two hours to reach the vessel
i must remove him i gave my word

will is going to be all right his vital signs have stabilised and hes sleeping now
how is odan
ive placed him in stasis hes fine for the moment
you need some rest doctor
no if odan is to survive he needs to be implanted in the new host as soon as he arrives ill wait here
itll be some time
i know

doctor
is the trill host here
yes
good bring him in

doctor
i am kareel i am to become host to odan

the operation to implant odan into the new host was completed at nineteen hundred hours and appears to have been successful there were no difficulties in assimilation
doctor beverly could we talk for a moment
you should be sleeping you need to rest
ive never felt better except once or twice my poor beverly this has been so hard for you i want to thank you for your caring for your standing by me
i congratulate you you averted a war that would have cost many lives
yes it seems as though everything has turned out for the best and yes i am still odan and i still love you i cannot imagine that ever changing
i am glad that youre all right
is there to be nothing more
perhaps it is a human failing but we are not accustomed to these kinds of changes i cant keep up how long will you have this host what would the next one be i cant live with that kind of uncertainty perhaps someday our ability to love wont be so limited
i understand
odan i do love you please remember that

i will never forget you
the minds eye

personal log chief engineer geordi la forge stardate  i am en route to the planet risa to attend an artificial intelligence seminar captain picard has ordered me to arrive a few days early to have some fun and relax i intend to follow his orders to the very best of my ability


how about some different music computer something with a latin beat no i meant something with a gentle latin beat maybe a spanish guitar perfect hey whats the weather like on risa
risa is climatecontrolled for optimum tourist comfort
is that right how long before we get there
arrival at risa is scheduled for oh nine thirty two hours
three hours how about a game computer
please restate request
something to pass the time you know a diversion
select either visual interactive or verbal interactive
verbal
you have twenty seconds to respond to each question level of difficulty will increase as you progress proceed when ready
begin
list the resonances of the subquantum states associated with transitional relativity
thats easy
in alphabetical order
er well asymmetrical inverted phased stable
your time has expired
the fifth resonance is
universal
i knew that okay give me another one
list the field patterns associated with warp modulation in order of decreasing energy

oh theres the aft nacelle associative the forward  whoa computer sequence zero one zero maximum power to the shields kill the music enterprise this is shuttle seven ive encountered a romulan warbird coordinates at three 
warning shield failure
damn risa control anybody

captains log stardate  the enterprise has been ordered to accompany a special emissary from the klingon high council to the kriosian system where one of their colonies is fighting for independence

there was a time when the empire would crush a rebellion now it is tolerated we have enough problems on the home planet we dont wish to divert resources to such a trivial war
youre prepared to grant them independence
perhaps well conquer them again later if we wish
may i ask ambassador what has this to do with us
the governor of krios has charged that the federation is secretly aiding the rebels
does he have evidence
the council has sent me here to examine that evidence it was my decision to invite you to accompany me captain many on the council have great respect for you
kadlo i have been pleased to offer occasional assistance to the klingon people in the past
your modesty is very human captain i will excuse it
i can assure you ambassador the federation would never interfere in the internal affairs of the empire
let us hope not such interference would strike at the very basis of our alliance
captain we are in the war zone
indeed ambassador i will ask our chief security officer lieutenant worf to make a report
captain worfs discommendation makes that very awkward if i could work with one of the other security officers
lieutenant worf is my chief of security and my tactical officer this matter clearly falls within his jurisdiction
as you wish


hey hey hey hey take it easy  hey
welcome mister la forge weve waited a long time to meet you
i can tell youve gone to a lot of trouble
indeed we have you are going to be of great help to us
i wouldnt count on it

good very good do not enjoy yourself too much on risa

hey
your visor will be returned to you but first i want to show you something
show me something thatll be an interesting trick seeing as how i cant see anything without the visor

that is not quite true allow me to demonstrate i now have direct access to his visual cortex he has no choice but to see what i wish him to see i can feed him any image i choose he will be unable to ignore it his galvanic skin response has increased nine percent it seems commander la forge like many humans has a low tolerance for watching others suffer
why are you doing this
i am sorry commander it is a necessary step i apologize for your discomfort

here observe how a spring day on his native earth affects him hes looking at a beautiful meadow green trees birds a blue sky the heartbeat slows the galvanic skin response drops the body responds to our stimuli he is incapable of maintaining control of his own responses watch as i change the stimuli again once our work is done la forge will act normally totally unaware of his conditioning the perfect tool for our purpose
will there be any physical evidence of what you are doing to him

none commander that is why we chose la forge the utilisation of his preexisting neural implants makes our work impossible to detect
how will we be certain the procedure has been successful
i will programme him to perform a series of specific tests both before he leaves us and after he returns to the enterprise well be able to verify his effectiveness notice that his heart rate has slowed somewhat he is becoming accustomed to the horrors he is witnessing so we change horrors


there have been two rebel attacks on neutral freighters one a ferengi the other cardassian
both were engaged near the ikalian asteroid belt thats where the rebels must be hiding
the actinides in the asteroids provide positive protection against our sensors
they might attack a freighter but i doubt they would challenge a federation starship
especially with the federation furnishing them support
you would test the captains word with me kell is it because i have no honour in your eyes that you expect me to be disloyal
wrong of me to ask my apologies
captain picard does not lie if he says there is no federation assistance to the rebels there is none
good because i risked my own reputation and honour coming to picard
he will not disappoint you if that is all
there are some members of the high council who would thank you worf
thank me
for killing duras no doubt that had he lived one day he would ascended to head the council many were not looking forward to that
my motives were personal not political
motives who cares for motives humans perhaps what matters is you acted that day as a true klingon

where are we mister la forge
this is ten forward
who is that man sitting over there

thats chief obrien
how long has he served with you
almost four years
i want you to kill him
okay
take this phaser and kill chief obrien

finally i think ive found it you see this piece of conduit carrying the power to transporter seven and i know that cant be right so i take a closer look and sure enough
freeze simulations commander did you understand my request
well i its just i i dont
look at me now what did i ask you to do
kill chief obrien
then do as i asked resume programme
chief
i have to

good mister la forge very good why dont you enjoy a drink with your friends
mind if i join you guys
sure
he still hesitated prepare the equipment for another session
captains log stardate  we are orbiting krios awaiting our first meeting with the klingon governor commander la forge has rejoined the enterprise from risa


welcome back geordi
data
how was the seminar
very informative ill tell you all about it

it is fortunate we were able to coordinate your return on the teldarian cruiser
yeah when i heard the enterprise had been ordered to the krios system i thought i might be forced to endure another couple of weeks on risa
i am sorry to hear you did not enjoy yourself
i was joking
joking ah forced to endure risa your actual intent was to emphasise that you did enjoy yourself yes i see how that could be considered quite amusing
i missed you data

commander la forge
permission to come aboard sir
granted welcome back
thank you sir
commander la forge is my chief engineer
commander
hes has been attending a seminar on artificial intelligence on risa
im glad we got you back geordi were going to need your help on this
data tells me that the federation has been accused of aiding kriosian rebels
were to be presented with evidence today well need your help in analysing it
anything i can do

you had a good time
does it show
youre more relaxed than ive ever seen you

captain governor vagh has signalled he is ready to meet with you
very well advise him that we will transport sown to the surface immediately ambassador

commander riker
what is it data
our sensors have detected a brief energy fluctuation in the eband
eband thats unusual whats the source
unknown sir eband emissions are difficult to localise
collapsing protostars sometimes emit eband bursts
yes sir however there are no protostars in this sector
youd better run a complete scan keep me posted
yes sir

the carnelians have actually done the most work on artificial intelligence so i spent a lot of time in their research seminars
geordi i get the feeling that something special happened on this vacation and im not talking about computers
well i did take second place in a chess tournament
yes
and i swam a lot i worked on my back stroke the water is very calm on risa
and
and i walked a lot thats all well i ate enough for twelve people the food there is terrific theyve got a chocolate there counsellor you would love
and thats all
yeah well there was this
yes
her name is jonek but you wouldnt want to hear about that better get ready for duty nice talking to you counsellor

we talk we socialise we waste time and the insurrection continues to grow these rebels need to be crushed not coddled
governor it does not matter what you or i think the high councils made its wishes clear
the council should be more interested in federation interference
governor exactly what do you think the federation has done
your medical supplies have been found in rebel strongholds
we make no effort to restrict access to our medical supplies
are your weapons also freely available
no they are not
then explain this

you took this weapon from the rebels
that and many more like it
it does appear to be federation issue
governor with your permission i would like to take this weapon back to the enterprise to verify its origin
as you wish i have hundreds more
even if these weapons are genuine i can assure you that a third party must have been involved the federation is not in the business of supplying arms to rebels
this is the only klingon colony on the border of federation space you cannot deny that starfleet would be happy to see krios gain its independence it would reduce your vulnerability to an attack
governor you speak as if we are enemies not allies
and you speak the lies of a taarchek
quvath guycha baka
gentlemen
you swear well picard you must have klingon blood in your veins
governor i will report to you as soon as the analysis of that weapon is complete captain commander
enterprise three to transport

intercooler flux down to five percent plasma deviation steady at point seven two
aye sir
well if you guys keep running at this efficiency i might as well go back to risa for another week just run through a level four series and then call it a night huh id help you but theres something ive got to take care of

red torian please  thank you

oh im sorry

its all right
my glass it just slipped
its nothing just a little cold
yeah but youre all soaked here
its nothing serious
let me get you something to wipe that off with
ill just go to my quarters and change
you sure
dont think twice about it commander


energy flow is within normal parameters from the prefire chamber to the emission aperture
rapid nadion pulse right on target beam control assembly safety interlock both checked out beam width intensity controls also responding correctly
energy cell usage remains constant at one point oh five megajoules per second curious the efficiency reading on the discharge crystal is well above starfleet specifications
yeah by quite a bit ninety four point one percent efficiency
our most efficient discharge crystal typically fires with eighty six point five percent efficiency
lets take a closer look at the wave pattern on the emission beam that might tell us why its losing so little energy
pulse frequency out of prefire chamber reads steady
there thats not right the initial output spike is inverted
that might suggest that the weapon has been charged with a forced pulse well into the terahertz range
then its definitely not starfleet issue and there cant be that many systems that use the terahertz feeds
three hundred twenty seven to our knowledge we can probably achieve an exact match with a random computer search it will take approximately three hours
i think we could narrow this down with a little common sense data who has the most to gain from a conflict between the klingon empire and the federation

the romulans they fashioned a perfect federation rifle but they had to charge it from their energy sources so the discharge crystal and the emission beam pattern correspond to those youd find in a romulan disrupter
the romulans have no interest in kriosian independence the planet is too far from their borders
but they do have an interest in driving the federation and the empire apart our alliance is the only thing that has kept them in check
romulan replications using stolen federation technology
its a typical romulan ploy an attempt to sow dissension and mistrust commander youve done well i would thank you on behalf of the empire
i still have my doubts picard i will want my own technicians to confirm your findings
of course my staff will give you their full cooperation
you may go


another eband blip
yes sir however the difference in intensity indicates that this one did not originate from the same location as the first
if its changed intensity it cant possibly be a protostar
that is a reasonable assumption
is there any known instance of romulans using eband communications
not to my knowledge sir
can you track the source
we can reconfigure the primary sensor array if we narrow their focus to scan for eband emissions we might be able to calculate a directional vector but only if there are more occurrences
do it

computer reroute the power flow in the cargo bay four transporter to the auxiliary replicator system
please verify command with necessary protocol
initiate protocol three six four dash b
verify priority clearance
recognise la forge theta two nine nine seven
acknowledged power has been rerouted through auxiliary power distribution system code number four four seven six two
now redirect transporter mode to the planetary sensor array
transporter mode has been redirected

verify that all record of these modifications are being erased from each directory
affirmative erasure process is proceeding


sir we are being hailed by governor vagh
on screen mister worf governor
you astonish me picard did you seriously believe you would succeed do you think we are blind
i dont understand
we intercepted the weapons you tried to transport to the surface
governor i assure you
do not insult us both by denying it maintain your position until further notice do not attempt to leave orbit

klingon attack cruiser uncloaking sir
on screen
two birds of prey approaching

sensors confirm an unauthorised transporter beam at eleven twenty three hours
do you know which transporter was used
im not sure captain whoever did it apparently used the planetary array to bypass the transport sensors
what about the transporter logs
theyre blank
how many people on board are capable of doing this geordi
im not even sure how it was done yet as soon as i find out maybe i can give you an answer not many thats for sure

vagh is fully prepared to fire upon the enterprise i have convinced him it would not be wise to take any action without first consulting the high council
how long do we have
a few hours at most
mister la forge your recommendations
it might be possible to locate the point of origin by tracing power flows at the time of transport
make it so

the primary plasma system does not indicate a power drain from any of the transporters
then whoever used the transporter must have bypassed the primary feeds
tracking power from secondary systems no surges to any of the transporters indicated
damn who could have pulled this off try the lifesupport power flows
no abnormal surges indicated
replicator waveguides there thats not a replicator energy pattern trace it
cargo bay four
la forge to worf security to cargo bay four

ive run a level one diagnostic as far as i can tell the unit hasnt been tampered with
this has to be the transfer point
perhaps the perpetrator reprogrammed the memory chips to erase any record
youre talking about thirty or forty chips in half a dozen different control systems
which members of the crew could have accomplished that
i think i could have done it if i put my mind to it the chief data lieutenant costa thats about it
procedure requires that i ask each of you where you were at eleven twenty three hours
i was with keiko in the arboretum
i was on the bridge at my station
i was in my quarters
was anyone with you
no i was alone costa was on duty in engineering im sure hes got twenty witnesses
then there is someone on board who isnt what he or she seems to be
data lets do a detailed scan on every chip in this assembly theres got to be some kind of trail we can follow

the isolinear chips were definitely altered
programmed to erase all operator commands once the transfer was complete
but with the chips erased what evidence remained
the erasures were complete however an analysis of the subatomic structure revealed an almost undetectable residual pattern in time we may be able to reconstruct the perpetrators authorisation code
do you have any idea whos responsible
no sir everyone with the necessary skills also has an alibi except for me that is i was alone in my quarters at the time
then whoever did this must have been specially trained for the task
our forensic team is trying to identify anyone who might have been in cargo bay four today
its not going to be easy there were a lot of people in and out of there
riker to data
yes commander
sensors have picked up another eband emission
acknowledged i will be there shortly
eband emission
we have been picking up a curious intermittent blip commander riker has speculated that it may be a romulan transmission i am attempting to track its source
proceed thank you mister la forge

we do not have much time picard vagh is not known for his patience
assure him that we are doing everything possible and advise him that if necessary i will defend my ship
with your permission i will transport down to the planet
of course
may i suggest that you issue an invitation to vagh to personally witness your continuing investigation
do you think he will come
i will do everything in my power to see that he does qapla picard
qapla ambassador


come in mister la forge

the investigation is moving faster than we expected you are in danger of being exposed i will transport to the surface when i return ill have governor vagh with me your captain and i will bring him to the cargo bay i want you to kill him there in front of many witnesses use a hand phaser when he is dead you will claim that you acted on behalf of starfleet in support of kriosian independence
i understand


la forge to obrien obrien
go ahead commander what can i do for you
nothing chief im sorry to disturb you im sorry

hiya doc
geordi hi what can i do for you
well i just cant seem to get any sleep i was hoping you could give me something
sit down lets take a look you couldnt sleep at all
i was restless i kept waking up
would you take off your visor please
sure
is there something on your mind
no i dont think so
well everybody goes through these occasional bouts of insomnia theres probably nothing to worry about lets just make sure theres nothing physically wrong theres a minor vascular irregularity in the visual cortex a slight dilation of the blood vessels its nothing serious what about your visor has it been giving you any problems lately
nothing out of the ordinary
all the same it might be a good idea to have it examined when we get to starbase thirty six next month
okay
in the meantime i will get you a somnetic inducer to put by your bed itll help you to sleep
thanks doc im sure ill be fine

energise

governor vagh thank you for coming
you can thank ambassador kell i am here against my better judgment
captain i think the first thing the governor should see is the investigation underway in the cargo bay
of course

from inside the enterprise youre sure
the first and third eband blips were clearly generated on board the ship the second came from the planet surface
generated by what
unknown sir
mister data we have a known spy on board and now we have unexplained signals on board i think its reasonable to assume that theyre related somehow wouldnt you
one could speculate that the eband is being used for some form of covert communication
we need more than speculation mister data we need to know who what where when and why or we may be going to war
yes sir computer run an analysis of all known romulan transmission formats all bands identify any commonalities with displayed waveform
no commonalities noted
does this waveform match that of any known communication format
negative
broaden search pattern beyond communications does the waveform displayed conform to any natural phenomena cryptographic formats or lifeform em emissions
the signal corresponds to a delta compressed wavelength spectrum similar to human neural frequencies
as in a human brainwave pattern
affirmative
what kind of receiver would be capable of processing these signals
a system designed to modify the electromagnetic spectrum and carry those messages directly to the human brain


computer link with the shuttles onboard system access the isolinear storage assembly scan all chips which contain mission logs note any discrepancies
no discrepancies noted
perform a level  diagnostic on the shuttles power and navigational systems
the components specified are all within normal tolerances

my technicians have examined all of the ships transporters sir i can assure you this is the only unit that has been tampered with

computer scan the shuttles structural integrity
submicroscopic deformations are present in the nose section and aft thrusters
probable cause of these variations
the shuttle has been subjected to stress consistent with a tractor beam


all our transporter containers have a slight impurity in the structural alloys which allows us to trace our material

commander la forge
what can i do for you chief
could you take a look at the pattern buffers considering whats happened im not sure the control systems are reliable
sure sure lets take a look

computer i am reading anomalous variations in the molecular structure of these memory chips please confirm
analysis confirmed
probable cause
replication
compare these variations with established romulan replication patterns
the patterns are identical

maybe we should run a level one diagnostic on those phase transition coils
right commander
data to la forge

report please geordi

please respond

computer current location of commander la forge
cargo bay four
data to lieutenant worf

priority one
go ahead

take commander la forge into custody immediately

sir

that is an order


dna samples by tracing biochemical signatures well be able to determine who has been in this bay recently
but how will it be possible to prove which one was responsible

qac ken tavak
la forge

mister worf get him out of here

arming our enemies is not enough now the federation would murder me to achieve its aims
governor if i could explain this i would
i believe i can help captain i have been able to determine that commander la forge was abducted by romulans en route to risa it is likely that he was somehow forced to take part in the plot to assassinate governor vagh
i saw no evidence of romulans we just witnessed him acting very much alone
no sir you did not i do not believe the commander is acting of his own accord he has been receiving eband signals through his visor signals which are carrying direct commands to his brain i have surmised that commander la forge was conditioned by romulans a process referred to historically and somewhat inaccurately as brainwashing
but to what end why would the romulans want to kill me
the romulans have always wanted to destroy the alliance between the federation and the klingons if mister la forge had killed you governor i think you would agree they might have succeeded
who sent these signals a cloaked romulan ship
no sir that is not possible the signals had to be transmitted within close proximity to the visor
are you suggesting there was a romulan accomplice in close proximity to la forge when he was receiving the signals
yes sir i am
this romulan accomplice who is he
i have narrowed the list of possibilities to two people the only two people who were with commander la forge all three times a transmission was recorded captain picard and ambassador kell one of them may be concealing an eband transmitter if they would agree to be searched
i am a klingon an emissary of the high council i will not be submit to being searched by you or anyone else on this ship
i am forced to agree captain we will take the ambassador with us and search him ourselves
captain i believe it to be in all best interests if i remain on board i formally request asylum
i will certainly grant you asylum when you have been absolved of this crime
gurtank tela


but i remember everything like there was this one night at dinner we had this andorian waiter he couldnt get our orders right it did happen i remember being on risa
i know you do just take that memory and put it aside for a moment and tell me everything you remember about the shuttlecraft trip after you left the enterprise
well i was just trying to get in the mood i played some music i talked to the computer you know what its like on a long trip
and when you saw the romulan ship did you try calling for help
no the first thing i did wait a minute thats but thats
itll take time geordi a long time but we will reconstruct your memory together
im just not sure about anything
believe it or not thats a good sign a beginning now lets go back to the shuttlecraft there was a romulan ship and the first thing you did was
in theory

redemption

captains log stardate  were en route to the klingon home world where i will participate in the installation ceremony of gowron the next designated leader of the high council this visit should also provide an opportunity for one of my officers to correct a grave injustice


enter
am i intruding
no sir my apologies captain i can be back in uniform
no that wont be necessary mister worf im not here as your captain im here as the man who stood with you before the high council your chadich we will arrive at your home world in less than a day
it is not time yet
that doesnt sound like the man who came to me a year ago fiercely determined to return home and to clear his fathers name or die trying isnt it time to confront the council to regain your family name let the truth be known
i have been told that patience is sometimes a more effective weapon than the sword
patience is a human virtue one which i am glad to see youve taken to heart but doesnt this situation require a more klingon response your discommendation is a facade to protect less honourable men it is a lie lies must be challenged
i have grown weary of bearing this dishonour
riker to picard
go ahead number one

weve been intercepted by the klingon vessel bortas

they claim to be our escort
no escort was scheduled

the bortas is standing by captain
on screen gowron this is an unexpected pleasure
i must speak with you picard we will have to move quickly if we are to be successful
successful
yes in preventing a klingon civil war

the family of duras is massing support they have many allies on the council
duras died in disgrace by klingon tradition his family should share that disgrace
their corruption has poisoned the empire honour will soon have no meaning
and who speaks for his family now
lursa and betor the sisters of duras
and they would claim the leadership of the council
women may not serve on the council
then how
i dont know but they are plotting something they have secured the loyalty of at least three fleet commanders lursa and betor are feared and fear is power
i do not see what i can do to assist
you were first chosen as arbiter of succession because no klingon could be trusted you accepted this duty and you must see it through to the end you must ensure my installation
that is beyond my purview
you will not support me
i will not step outside the traditional role of the arbiter
and if they attempt to block my installation
then i can only assure you that i will deal with any challenge according to klingon law
i fear that will not be enough

mister worf would you escort our guest to the transporter room

begin monitoring romulan activity along the neutral zone mister data have the outpost stations send us their tactical reports
aye sir
the duras family are preparing to move against gowron
backed by romulans
i dont know but there is too much history between the duras and the romulans to discount the possibility

dismissed

i would speak with you
i do not hear the words of traitors
i am not a traitor
you admitted your guilt before the council
i accepted discommendation to protect the empire
protect it how
it was duras father who betrayed our people to the romulans at khitomer not mine
duras there is proof of this
there is
why would you accept dishonour to protect duras
his family was too powerful to expose him would have split the empire instead the council chose to blame my father
the council knew
i believe you to be a man of honour gowron i ask you restore my family name
worf you killed duras i consider that no small favour but what you ask is impossible
but after your installation
the grasp of duras reaches out from the grave much of the council is still loyal to his family i must have the councils support to survive i cannot expose their treachery you chose to accept this disgrace for the good of the empire now you must live with your decision like a klingon


guinan
its a little quiet down in ten forward so i thought id get off a little target practice do you mind if i join you
you practise
i like to keep my eye sharp
i practice at level fourteen
guess i could come down to that level for a while begin programme

you know i had a bet with the captain that i could make you laugh before you became lieutenant commander
not a good bet today
ive seen you laugh i like it
klingons do not laugh

oh yes they do absolutely they do you dont but ive heard some klingon belly laughs that would curl your hair

your son laughs hes a klingon
he is a child and part human
thats right and youre not youre full klingon except you dont laugh
i do not laugh because i do not feel like laughing
other klingons feel like laughing what does that say about you
perhaps it says that i do not feel like other klingons

programme complete
good game dont feel bad i was doing this long before you were born so how is he your son
he is having difficulty adjusting to life on earth
i can see where it might be hard for the little guy living with humans being klingon could be very confusing
it will not be easy for him
no it wont but at some point hes going to want to know what its like to really be a klingon just as youre learning

come
captain i request a leave of absence
mister worf request granted
thank you sir
lieutenant qapla

and good luck
lieutenant worf personal log stardate  i have located the klingon ship on which my brother kurn serves as captain and have arranged to join him

it has been too long my brother
too long we have much to discuss i have asked gowron to restore our family honour he has refused
gowron will not live to see the day he leads the council
what do you mean
he stands alone surrounded by his enemies lursa and betor will have him killed and if they dont i will
you will
gowron is weak the family of duras must never be allowed to lead the council our leaders have failed us they no longer deserve our loyalty it is time to sweep away the old council and put a new one in its place
how can this be done
i already have the support of four squadron commanders in key strategic sectors when the time comes they will follow me join us worf and we will usher in a new era and regain our family name

no
what
gowron has completed the rite of succession it is our duty to support him
gowron spits in your face when you ask him to give back what is rightfully ours and you would support him
we cannot regain honour by acting dishonourably
i will not support gowron
i am the elder brother kurn i speak for our family we will back gowron but not now not yet we will wait until he feels the grasp of his enemies around his throat then we will offer him our support and the price will be the restoration of our family name
it will be difficult to convince my allies to back gowron but i will try i must go to the mempa sector to meet with the other squadron commanders
contact me when you have gained their support then i will be ready for gowron
captains log stardate  my role as arbiter of succession has again brought me to the great hall of the klingon high council

nadev ghos

have you reached a decision regarding the succession of power
qaja plu ditch jung la woq you ghir klas qimha gowron doj hon doj hon
gowron son of mrel haktem the arbiter confirms that you have completed the rite of succession your enemies have been destroyed you stand alone do you wish to claim leadership of the council
i wish it
are there no other challengers

there is one i will challenge him
an arrogant child
who are you
i am toral son of duras
duras had no son
but he did gowron
so this is your doing lursa
we wish to address the council
lursa betor come forward
members of the high council it is a day of great rejoicing for the family of duras and the klingon empire we have discovered that our brother did indeed have a son and heir
this is outrageous duras had no mate where did you find him lursa in a harlots bedchamber
i will personally cut your tongue out yintagh
impudent wretch
a simple genetic scan will prove his bloodline is valid
the illegitimate son of duras cannot rule the high council
the arbiter will consider his validity lenmat


our allies on the council backed torals claim its in picards hands now
excellent everything is proceeding as scheduled
why not just kill picard
fool do we want the federation as our enemy
no

at least not yet but when the time is right we will deal with the federation and captain picard

i have met with the other squadron commanders here three will join us one will not that gives us enough strength to control seven key sectors
do you know the strength of our enemies
they have at least seven squadrons but most of the fleet has not decided which banner to follow
gowron is nearly out of options soon he will have no choice
i will return soon to the home world we shall meet then

do you also require the original logs recorded during the attack lieutenant
everything we have on the khitomer massacre
we can provide you with our analysis of the communications between the khitomer outpost and the romulan ships however for a complete record you will have to contact starbase twenty four
mister worf have you cancelled your leave
no sir
lieutenant would you join me in my ready room

mister worf youre using our files on the khitomer massacre as evidence against duras father
yes sir
do you not see an inherent conflict of interest here
sir those federation records will help me prove that my father was falsely accused of treason
you are using your position as a starfleet officer to affect political change on your planet there could not be a worse compromise of our fundamental principles
do not tie my hands now i must be able to prove my fathers innocence those federation records can do that
mister worf here i am lecturing you on a conflict of interest while im desperately trying to avoid one of my own do you think i wish to allow the duras family to solidify their hold on the council do you think i cannot see for myself the implications for the federation good lord duras tried to have me killed all of my instincts my training my very being as a starfleet officer are at odds with my responsibilities as arbiter of the klingon high council we walk the same tightrope between two worlds you and i we must try our very best to keep those two worlds separate or we shall certainly fall
yes sir
i will make the khitomer massacre files available to anyone who wants them to the high council to the duras family to you anyone
thank you sir
mister worf this is as far as i can go

riker to picard
yes number one

theres a message coming in for you from the surface its coded personal

send it through

captain welcome please come in be seated

something to drink captain tea earl grey perhaps
thank you
you come alone and unarmed
nothing would be served by killing the arbiter before his decision
nevertheless a brave act captain
betor
your invitation was unexpected
we should have extended it much sooner
we dont want you to judge us by your experience with our brother
duras was a fool
he deserved to die
forget him we have
we do not wish to be your enemy
quite the opposite
that pleases me
have you made your decision regarding torals challenge
i am pursuing it with due vigilance

allow me to heat your tea
toral has the bloodline to lead the empire into the next century he has the support of the people
then it remains to see if he has the support of the law
but he must surely you can see that
ill tell you what i see if i find torals challenge valid the two of you will very quickly gain control of the council and gowron will be found dead shortly thereafter if i reject torals claim you will accuse me of serving federation interests it will serve as a rallying cry to declare war and overthrow gowron
you see very clearly captain but one thing is missing if you rule against us and we are victorious in a war against gowron
which we would be
it will mean the end of the alliance with the federation
and we would hate to see that happen as much as you would
this is not a threat captain just an unfortunate truth
so why be our enemy when you can be our friend
you have manipulated the circumstances with the skill of a romulan my decision will be announced at high sun tomorrow excellent tea good day ladies

what is your decision
ktal this council knows the law of heredity well gnow juk hol pajhard a son shall share in the honours or crimes of his father toral is duras son that has been established by the genetic scan but with due respect to the traditions and laws of this high council there is no basis for accepting a petition for leadership from a boy who has fought no battles shed no blood for his people or earned no honour for himself one day perhaps he shall but not now duras is dead his claim to the leadership died with him gowron shall lead the council
the arbiter has ruled there are no more challengers
does the federation dictate klingon destiny or do we follow me and i will show you honour
follow him and you reject all klingon law

can you not see what you are doing are you blind to what they represent then go your blood will paint the way to the future

your message said it was urgent what do you want
your forces are weak gowron you need help to fight the family of duras
from one dishonoured klingon
i offer you four klingon squadrons
why would they follow you a starfleet officer
they are pledged to support my brother kurn
kurn is your brother
yes his true bloodlines were hidden to protect him
kurn will follow me he has opposed me in the past
i am the elder brother he will do as i say
what is it you want in return
you know my price
the return of your honour for the support of four squadrons no that will not be enough the duras family controls most of the fleet we must have federation help
they will not intervene
perhaps not yet but starfleet command will listen to picard and picard listens to you
i can ask nothing more of him in this matter
what
my duty as a starfleet officer
you come to me and demand the restoration of your family honour and now you hide behind human excuses what are you worf do you tremble and quake with fear at the approach of combat hoping to talk your way out of a fight like a human or do you hear the cry of the warrior calling you to battle calling you to glory like a klingon

this is captain kurn of the heghta we come to defend the empire and to follow the banner of gowron
the enemy has sustained major damage to its life support systems they have disengaged
you have done well commander kurn lursa and betor have moved more quickly than i anticipated we shall not underestimate them again meet us at the great hall

advise the enterprise that their delegation is welcome to attend my installation as leader
captains log stardate  with newfound support gowron has chosen to proceed with the installation ceremony the enterprise has returned so that i may perform my final duty as arbiter of succession


receive now the loyalty of the council and of the empire
qapla
nadev ghos

you both fought as warriors you have proved your hearts are klingon

i return your family honour i give you back that which was wrongfully taken from you let your name be spoken once again you are worf son of mogh

the duras family is gathering a large force near beta thoridar as per the terms of the treaty of alliance i now formally request your assistance in fighting these enemies of the empire
these enemies are klingons
by right and tradition i am the sole leader all who oppose me are traitors
i understand your position but i sure youre aware that the federation cannot interfere in what is by definition an internal klingon affair
you arbitrated the rite of succession you are already involved
my duties in that regard are finished
captain we must intervene the duras family is corrupt and hungry for power with no sense of honour or loyalty they represent a grave threat to the security of the federation captain you and i know that they have conspired with romulans in the past if they should be victors in this war they will surely form a new klingonromulan alliance that would represent a fundamental shift of power in this quadrant starfleet must support gowron it is in the interests of both the federation and the empire i beg you support us in our cause
mister worf i dont have to lecture you on the principle of non interference as starfleet officers we have all sworn an oath to uphold that principle whatever our personal feelings im sorry i must refuse your request

mister worf im afraid i must recall you to duty the enterprise will be leaving this sector immediately
captain i respectfully request that i be allowed to take an extended leave of absence
mister worf your responsibilities as a starfleet officer are incompatible with remaining on board a klingon ship during a time of war
captain
i order you to return to duty at once
then i resign my commission as a starfleet officer

i will await you aboard the bortas


enter
am i intruding
no sir
i understand that youll be serving on board the bortas
as weapons officer
your tactical knowledge and experience will serve them well
thank you sir
mister worf are you certain that this is the right decision
i was rescued from khitomer by humans raised and loved by human parents ive spent most of my life around humans fought beside them but i was born a klingon my heart is of that world i do hear the cry of the warrior i belong with my people
being the only klingon ever to serve in starfleet gave you a singular distinction but i felt that what was unique about you was your humanity compassion generosity fairness you took the best qualities of humanity and made them part of you the result was a man who i was proud to call one of my officers ill have your belongings transported to the bortas
thank you sir


attention on deck


permission to leave the ship sir
permission granted qapla
goodbye

dismissed


picard has rejected gowrons plea for help the enterprise has left orbit
coward he didnt have the courage to face us the federation is
celebrate later toral we should not discount jean luc picard yet he is human and humans have a way of showing up when you least expect them

redemption part 

last time on star trek the next generation
we will have to move quickly if we are to be successful
successful
yes in preventing a klingon civil war
i would speak with you
i do not hear the words of traitors
it was duras father who betrayed our people to the romulans at khitomer not mine
we have discovered that our brother did indeed have a son and heir
follow me and i will show you honour
your blood will paint the way to the future
if we go to the aid of the bortas well be dragging the federation into a klingon civil war
you both fought as warriors i return your family honour
mister worf your responsibilities as a starfleet officer are incompatible with remaining on board a klingon ship during a time of war
then i resign my commission as a starfleet officer
picard has rejected gowrons plea for help the enterprise has left orbit
we should not discount jean luc picard yet he is human and humans have a way of showing up when you least expect them
and now the conclusion


maintain course status of warp engines warp engines at fifty percent

maintain course
theyre closing on us
stand by dah

captains log stardate  we have arrived at starbase two thirty four where i have taken the opportunity to make a proposal to fleet admiral shanthi

there have been three major engagements in the last two weeks all of them won by ships loyal to the duras family
 none of which is our concern jeanluc the klingon civil war is by definition an internal matter of the empire
agreed but if the duras are being aided by the romulans it becomes very much our concern the romulans have been attempting to destroy the klingonfederation alliance for the past twenty years at the same time the duras have been secretly conspiring with the romulans doesnt it strike you as odd that the duras are able to field such an overpowering force against gowron that they outmatch him at almost every turn
some would call it good leadership
and some would say they must be getting help the romulans are prepared to take enormous risks to gain any advantage over the federation can we seriously believe that now with the future of the klingon empire in the balance they are content to stand by and watch
what is it you propose captain
we must stop the flow of supplies and equipment to the duras from the romulans what i propose is that we send a fleet to the romulanklingon border well take no offensive action but we will be in a position to expose any romulan supplies that attempt to cross the border
a blockade
exactly
but how would you overcome the romulan cloaking device
my chief engineer has developed a system that should nullify that advantage each ship will send out an active tachyon beam to the other blockading ships now in theory any cloaked vessel that attempts to pass between our ships must cross that beam and be detected
ill have to clear this with the federation council in the meantime assemble your fleet captain

nicely done i hope we know what were doing
so do i number one
captains log stardate  convincing starfleet command to establish a blockade was relatively painless implementing that plan is proving more troublesome

starfleet is stretched pretty thin across the quadrant there are only about twelve ships within a days travel of this position
the only other ships available are either in spacedock for repairs or still under construction most of them dont even have full crews yet
we could probably scare up seven maybe eight more ships
mister la forge can you implement your tachyon detection grid with twenty ships
its possible but the more ships the bigger the net we can throw
all right i want to add the tian nan men the sutherland and the hermes whether the yard superintendent says theyre ready or not mister data will you select a group of experienced enterprise officers to augment the crews of those ships
aye sir
will i want you to command the excalibur her crew was reassigned when she put in for repairs geordi you will be his first officer
aye sir
i want the fleet underway by oh nine hundred tomorrow thank you gentlemen

yes mister data
may i ask a question sir of a personal nature
yes
i am confused why have i not been assigned to command a ship in the fleet sir
well i felt that you would be needed here why do you ask
you have commented on the lack of senior officers available for this mission i believe my twenty six years of starfleet service qualifies me for such a post however if you do not believe the time has arrived for an android to command a starship perhaps i should address myself to improving my
commander i believe the starship sutherland will need a captain i can think of no one better suited to the task than you
thank you sir


you always did have fools working for you larg now you dont have as many
you were lucky kurn but luck always runs out someday i will stand over your broken corpse and drink to the victory of the duras
ah worf good this piece of baktag is captain larg he commanded the squadron that tried to destroy us yesterday
the infamous worf son of mogh what is that you are wearing that is the uniform of a klingon
the capital city is neutral ground and largs men are all around us as are mine
good to drink with you kurn may you die well
die well larg

you drink with our enemies
how many are gowrons men how many are duras does it matter when we meet in battle we will fight to the death but here here were all warriors all klingons
the repairs to the heghta are proceeding the port stabilisers
is there nothing in your heart but duty
it is my responsibility
we all have responsibilities and duties but you and i are warriors fighting in a great war think of it you and i will fight battles that others can only dream of the time for glory is here it is not a time to worry about stabilisers it is a time to celebrate for tomorrow we all may die come let us the sons of mogh live this night as if it were our last

worf is not like his brother
no he tries to be but hes still unsure of himself
perhaps he needs something to help restore his confidence
i think hell find our offer appealing
ill make sure he does

youve got to keep this mixture above ninety percent or well never leave orbit thank you mister krags

i am lieutenant commander data
lieutenant commander christopher hobson
by order of starfleet i hereby take command of this vessel please note the time and date in the ships log
excuse me sir id like to request a transfer
may i ask why
i dont believe id be a good first officer for you
your service record to date suggests that you would perform that function adequately
no no no thats not what i mean i dont think that i would be a good first officer for you
why
frankly sir i dont believe in your ability to command this ship youre a fellow officer and i respect that but no one would suggest that a klingon would make a good ships counsellor or that a berellian could be an engineer theyre just not suited for those positions by the same token i dont think an android is a good choice to be captain
i understand your concerns request denied

 the endeavour has cleared the dock captain all ships standing by
good course one one eight mark three five seven full impulse power signal the fleet to get underway well enter warp once were clear of the system
aye sir
engage

the romulan convoy is late we need those supplies
 gowron has suffered another loss in the mempa system his forces will not threaten you in that region for some time
but if gowron
the convoy will arrive in due course

the federation fleet has left starbase two thirty four theyve set course for klingon territory
how many
at least twenty starships
whos commanding this fleet
picard
what does it mean is the federation going to enter the war should we attack them before they get here
silence the child or send him away movar i want you to return to romulus immediately have all available ships rendezvous at these coordinates in two days
yes commander
twenty ships arent enough to wage a war starfleet must be bluffing
perhaps

our forces in the mempa sector are now in full retreat they will need to regroup near beta lankal
we destroyed their supply bases in that sector three weeks ago how can they continue to fight
they must be getting help
maybe they have better leaders i say you have failed as our leader gowron

there is no time for this we must make plans before those forces reach beta lankal how can we oppose the duras when we continue to fight among ourselves
gowron must answer a challenge to his authority
stop it do we to fall upon ourselves like a pack of ferengi the enemy is the duras we are at war

now the war can continue

were crossing into klingon territory captain
signal the fleet to maintain yellow alert until further notice
aye sir
begin long range scans of the romulan border
no uncloaked ships within sensor range a few subspace anomalies but nothing firm
those anomalies could be cloaked ships
could be sir
open a channel to the excalibur
excalibur riker here
deploy the fleet will its time to spread our net
yes sir

weve arrived at the designated coordinates captain
all stop notify the flagship that we have assumed station
starboard power coupling has overloaded weve got a radiation leak on decks ten through twelve
why are the backups not functioning
there wasnt enough time to test all the backups before we left the yard terry i want you down in engineering working on a new coupling
you have taken the phaser and torpedo control units offline
keith you and i will start bringing the radiation
mister hobson it is inappropriate for you to determine a course of action without consulting the commanding officer
i was trying to safeguard the lives of people on those decks but youre right belay those orders everyone phasers and torpedoes are back online what should we do sir
you will take the phasers and torpedo units offline and begin repairs of the starboard power coupling
thank you sir you heard the captain everyone

were ready sir
mister la forge how long do you think it will take the romulans to detect the tachyon field once its activated
not long romulan sensors are as good as ours
very well energise the network

theres an increase in tachyon emissions from the federation fleet
theyre using the beams as a detection field
if we try to cross it theyll see us even if were cloaked
issue orders to begin work on a way to penetrate this field in the meantime well have to convince captain picard he should leave

captain im picking up something directly ahead romulan ship decloaking shall i raise shields
not yet
theyre hailing us sir
on screen tasha
no captain i am commander sela the woman you knew as tasha yar was my mother deploying an invasion fleet along our border is a clear act of aggression captain it will not be tolerated you have twenty hours to recall your ships and return peacefully to federation territory

so you believe her counsellor
im not saying we should accept her claim at face value but i sensed no deception from her she really believes she is the daughter of tasha yar
regardless of what she believes sela cant be her daughter ive reviewed all of tashas medical records and there is no indication that she was ever pregnant
besides tasha was a child when this woman was born
sela could have been cloned
or had her appearance surgically altered
but why what possible advantage could there be to the romulans as this now stands i dont think this will have any impact on our strategy well continue the blockade leave the next move to them thank you

am i intruding
no not at all is something wrong
news travels fast i heard that tasha yars daughter is aboard the romulan ship
i think that the romulans are just hoping to create a distraction they want to keep us off balance
how much do you know about what happened to the last ship called enterprise
enterprise c she was lost at the battle of narendra three defending a klingon outpost from the romulans
and the survivors
there were stories of prisoners taken back to romulus but these were only rumours
no there were survivors and tasha yar was one of them
guinan that was twenty three years ago tasha yar was only a child
i know that but i also know she was aboard that ship and she was not a child and i think you sent her there
how can that be
i dont know i just know that you did
tasha died a year before you came on the enterprise you never met her
i know that
if you have only a vague intuition
you cant just dismiss this if im right then you are responsible for this whole situation
i think that its time i met commander sela

we are at war gowron should forbid any challenges until we are victorious
a klingon does not postpone a matter of honour
a klingon should place the good of the empire above his own pride
so now gowron no longer suits you perhaps you mean to challenge him for the leadership of the council
no
then do not speak of this again i did not wish to follow gowron you came to me and insisted we support gowron against the duras family the time for debate is over we are klingons he is our leader if that is not enough for you then perhaps you made the wrong choice when you put on that uniform


well captain what is this urgent matter we need to discuss
please wont you sit down

im afraid that you have misinterpreted our presence here i want to reassure you that we have no hostile intention
ah then i can tell my superiors that a fleet of twenty three federation starships is on our border for what humanitarian reasons
it is our intent to prevent any external power from interfering in klingon affairs
nor do we have any plan to do so but captain if for any reason we chose to enter klingon territory how would you stop us with our cloaking devices we can slip by you at will
then why dont you just take your ships across
you sound eager for us to try perhaps youve discovered a method in detecting our ships however i dont think you asked me here to discuss our military situation
all right why did i invite you here
you want the answer to the only question on your mind how could tasha yar be my mother
its been suggested that she was aboard the enterprise c when it was destroyed twenty four years ago that she was one of the survivors and that obviously you are a product of a union between her and a romulan
but you know thats impossible she would have been a child when that battle occurred
and yet you claim that it is possible that youre the daughter of tasha yar
yes she was on that ship twenty four years ago she was sent there by you from the future she was among those few who survived they were all to have been executed after the interrogation but a romulan general saw her and became enamoured with her so a deal was struck their lives would be spared if she became his consort i was born a year later
i want to meet your mother can you arrange that
one night when i was four years old she came to me she bundled me up and she told me to stay quiet as we left the compound i realised she was taking me away she was taking me away from my home my father so i cried out my father offered her life he gave her a home gave her a child and how did she repay him by betrayal they executed her everything in me that was human died that day with my mother all thats left is romulan never doubt that
doubts im full of them but nothing in my experience can persuade me that what you have told me is true and i do know one thing it will not affect my judgment at our next encounter
you have fourteen hours captain i suggest you use them wisely


is something wrong
welcome worf son of mogh
what do you want
the same as you personal honour glory for the empire
your family has never valued honour
you knew only our brother we are not like him
our brother made many mistakes one was to make you an enemy
we would rather be your friends
then you should not have opposed gowron
gowron is nothing
toral is duras only son and he will be the leader of the council in your heart even you know that but toral needs guidance
a firm hand
a father figure that could be you if you were mated to betor
the rewards could be greater than you can imagine
nothing will stand in our way
we could rule the empire together
join us worf and usher in a new era for our people
an era where honour has no meaning where klingons trade loyalties in dark rooms and where the empire is ruled from romulus
enough lursa you failed i need to know the strength and capabilities of the federation fleet i dont have time for this turn him over to the guard betor can have him back when theyve finished with him
come

in thirteen hours well be forced to either withdraw from the border or fight the romulan fleet neither alternative is acceptable we must expose their involvement before the deadline
what is it you propose
if you launch a fullscale attack now then the duras fleet will call for supplies lursa and betor will call for help the romulans will try to run the blockade and well be ready for them
and once the romulan connection has been exposed support will fall away from lursa and betor very well i will make preparations one thing more picard worf has been captured by the duras i hope he dies well qapla

when gowron begins his attack then we will make our move excalibur will fall back with engine problems you will take the akagi and the hornet to this position which will open a small gap in our detection net
and if the romulans are already aware of the tachyon field they should run the blockade at that point
exactly when they try to bring their ships through the enterprise and the tian nan men will swing around close the gap and catch them in the act
very nice id better get back
good luck will
good luck captain

weve just received an urgent message from lursa and betor gowrons forces have attacked in three sectors the duras are nearing defeat
you mean they were caught unprepared and now theyre crying for help have the science sections found a way to circumvent the detection grid yet
we think so just before we cross the border well send out a massive tachyon pulse a burst that large should cause enough interference to disable a part of their network
good
one of their ships is moving off the blockade line
their warp drive is failing
picard is redeploying the fleet to compensate for the missing ship theres a gap opening in the net
he doesnt have enough ships to maintain the network
if we act quickly we can move through commander
no i dont think so
but its what weve been waiting for
yes i know and so does picard hes giving us exactly what we need and he expects us to take it no we wont step into picards trap we will disable part of his network here where theyre weakest well direct the energy burst right at the ship with the android captain

sir the detection net is picking up activity from the romulans fifteen cloaked ships spreading out along the border
signal the fleet to stand by
aye sir

now

come to course zero eight zero mark two nine five

theres a disruption in the tachyon detectors its localised to this segment of the net
open a channel to the sutherland
data here sir
were reading a disruption of the tachyon net in your area
yes sir the romulans have released a high energy burst the net is no longer effective in a radius of ten million kilometres around the sutherland
thats where theyre going through send a signal to the fleet all ships to fall back and rendezvous at gamma eridon well reestablish the net there
aye sir

all federation ships proceed at maximum warp to gamma eridon
acknowledge the signal ensign lay in the course and engage at warp nine point three
aye sir

what are you doing
in disrupting the detection net the romulans may have caused a residual tachyon signature to form around their own ships
but we have no way of detecting it
all stop
aye sir all stop
sir the fleets been ordered to gamma eridon
the tachyon signatures will not last long by the time the fleet is deployed it will be too late begin to reconfigure the sensors to detect ionised particle traces
the entire areas been flooded with tachyon particles well never be able to find what were looking for
i am aware of the difficulties please bring the phasers back online
that will flood three decks with radiation
we will initiate radiation protocol when necessary
you dont give a damn about the people whose lives youre throwing away were not just machines
mister hobson you will carry out my orders or i will relieve you of duty
yes sir

captain the sutherland isnt heading for the rendezvous point shes come to a full stop
open a channel

the enterprise wants to know the reason weve stopped
display sensor schematic display sensor sweep maximum range
are you going to answer the enterprise
overlay display with tachyon emissions highlight any tachyon signatures which show subspace inertial displacement concentrate a sensor sweep in that area

sir this is pointless those readings could be anything theres no way for us to be sure the romulans are out there
reconfigure photon torpedo warhead yields set for high energy burst level six
level six but that wont even
do it
torpedoes ready another message coming in its captain picard
mister data you were ordered to rendezvous with the fleet at gamma eridon acknowledge
stand by captain mister hobson prepare to fire
didnt you hear captain picard wants us
fire fire


they have discovered us
reverse course order the fleet back to romulan territory
commander the duras need this convoy without these supplies they cannot win
weve been exposed its over
but what should i tell lursa and betor
tell them theyre on their own

theyre changing course heading back to romulan space
make a full report to the flagship take the main phasers offline and begin radiation clean up on the affected decks
yes sir captain


defeat
how where are the romulans
they never came

kill him

no

toral the next leader of the empire gowron is looking forward to seeing you again
captains personal log stardate  it is with a profound sense of relief that i have ordered the fleet back to federation territory following the romulan withdrawal and the news of gowrons victory we have arrived at the klingon home world where i will present the high council with a full report on our encounter with the romulans

come
captain i wish to submit myself for disciplinary action i have disobeyed a direct order from a superior officer although the result of my actions proved positive the ends cannot justify the means
no they cant however the claim i was only following orders has been used to justify too many tragedies in our history starfleet doesnt want officers who will blindly follow orders without analysing the situation your actions were appropriate for the circumstances and i have noted that in your record

mister data nicely done
sir

the council appreciates your report captain the information on the romulan supply ships will prove very useful before you leave there is one last matter to attend to

bring him

toral son of duras you stand convicted of treason
the duras family will one day rule the empire
perhaps but not today worf this childs family wrongly took your name and your honour from you in return i give his life to you

whats wrong kill him
no
but its our way it is the klingon way
i know but it is not my way this boy has done me no harm and i will not kill him for the crimes of his family
then it falls to kurn
no no you gave me his life and i have spared it
as you wish
request permission to return to duty sir
granted
darmok

captains log stardate  the enterprise is en route to the uninhabited eladrel system its location is near the territory occupied by an enigmatic race known as the children of tama

apparently the tamarians apparently at eladrel four nearly three weeks ago they have been transmitting a subspace signal towards federation space ever since
the signal is a standard mathematical progression it does not carry a specific message
but they wanted us to know they were there
apparently so number one starfleet believes that their presence is an attempt at communication commander
federation vessels have encountered tamarian ships seven times over the past one hundred years each meeting went without incident however formal relations were not established because communication was not possible
why
the children of tama were called incomprehensible by captain silvestri of the shiku maru other accounts were comparable
a cause for concern for all we know they could be threatening our border
everything in the previous encounters suggests a peaceable race we have to start from there
agreed i appreciate your prudence mister worf but starfleet believes that the tamarians have extended a hand we must do the same
the children of tama ive heard rumours about them for years
indeed are they truly incomprehensible in my experience communication is a matter of patience imagination i would like to believe these are qualities we have in sufficient measure

rai and jiri at lungha rai of lowani lowani under two moons jiri of ubaya ubaya of crossed roads at lungha lungha her sky grey rai and jiri at lungha
counsellor
im sense nothing but good intentions from them captain
mister data
the tamarian seems to be stating the proper names of individuals and locations
yes but what does it all mean
i am at a loss sir
captain would you be prepared to consider the creation of a mutual nonaggression pact between our two peoples possibly leading to a trade agreement and cultural interchange does this sound like a reasonable course of action to you

where is he
the tamarians have transported captain picard to the planet surface along with their own captain
riker to obrien
it will not be possible to transport sir the tamarian ship has created a particle scattering field on the planets ionosphere
riker to captain picard captain do you read me can we compensate
no sir the tamarians are projecting a particle sustaining beam into the upper atmosphere the result is a hyperionisation that virtually disrupts all em and subspace carriers
then they cant communicate with their man either they wont be able to beam anyone through the field
that is correct however they have left sensor frequencies clear
then theyll be able to tell whats going on analysis mister worf what the hell is going on
a contest perhaps between champions our captain against theirs
theirs was armed


darmok and jalad
you want to fight with me is that it a challenge
darmok and jalad
i dont know who or what darmok and jalad are but i certainly didnt come here to start a war
darmok and jalad at tanagra

sorry captain
shaka when the walls fell


sensors show captain picard and the tamarian in apparent good health approximately twenty metres from each other
hail the tamarian ship
on screen
you are holding our captain i want him released
darmok at tanagra
your action could be interpreted as an act of war
kiteo his eyes closed chenza at court the court of silence chenza
is there any way to get through to them
not without further study
close the channel mister worf
gladly sir
worf i want you to assemble a security team take a shuttle down to the planet bring back the captain
aye commander
sir the tamarians are fully capable of stopping a shuttle
im aware of that but disrupting our transporter beam and firing on a shuttle are two entirely different things im betting theyre not going to push it that far


shaka when the walls fell
shaka indeed what now captain will you attack me in my sleep if i dont freeze to death first
darmok of kanza jalad of the kituay

thank you thank you
first officers log supplemental i am sending a shuttlecraft to find captain picard gambling that the tamarians will sit tight rather than risk an exchange of phaser fire

the positron density is point zero one three

electron concentration seven point nine five particle gradient four over seven we are two hundred and fifty kilometres from the planets surface
commander the shuttle has reached the e region of the planets ionosphere
how long can we maintain communication
the scattering layer induced by the tamarians is concentrated in the upper d region the shuttle will reach that area in approximately two minutes
the tamarian ship

maybe we called their bluff status mister worf

aye sir

enough to turn them back but not enough to hurt them
yes sir the phaser pulse appears to have been carefully attenuated for just that effect
nice shooting


im pretty sure i can punch up the annular confinement beam enough to transport the captain through the field but its going to take me at least a full day to do it
captain picard could be dead by then
i do not believe so i have confidence in his ability as a warrior he will be victorious
youre still assuming this is some sort of a challenge ritual we cant be certain of that
agreed were only making educated guesses about their motivations no more than that
then why do we wait if we attack the ship now they will not be able to maintain their scattering field
which might start a shooting match and for all we know a war and we still might not be able to save the captain
it would end this stalemate
its too much of a risk ill take that course when its the last one left who the hell are these people theres got to be some way to get through to them
as i have said with further study it may be possible
then do it deanna help him i want something by oh nine hundred hours


now where have you gone to my friend

forgive the intrusion captain but i need some answers


darmok at tanagra
shaka mirab his sails unfurled
darmok

freeze darmok
darmok well it seems to be a point of contention between them perhaps something the tamarian captain proposed that the first officer didnt like
the apparent emotional dynamic does seem to support that assumption as with the other terms used by the tamarian this appears to be a proper noun the name clearly carries a meaning for them
computer search for the term darmok in all linguistic databases for this sector

commander sensors are picking up an electromagnetic disturbance approaching the captains position

how close are we on that transporter
two hours maybe three
i want the captain out of there now
thats not very likely sir

i dont want to hear that commander

lefler whats the resonance frequency
point three four over standard
i want a resolution of point five three at the very least commander ill need about two more minutes

but theres a good chance this isnt going to work
if it fails
i know we will have tipped our hand to the tamarians but its a chance we have to take
agreed

no

ive got a piece of him commander but thats all

boost the confinement beam

one fifty seven over standard
its as solid as itll go commander



the tamarian and the entity are in close proximity the tamarians lifesigns are fluctuating
the scattering field is still in full force what the hell is wrong with them their sensors can read whats going on as well as ours can riker to obrien report

the fields still deflecting the signal there just isnt enough of him sir

open a channel to the tamarian ship
aye sir
your captain is under attack drop your particle field
kailash when it rises
they have closed the channel
obrien to bridge

i cant hold him commander


shaka
when the walls fell
first officers log stardate  our attempt to transport captain picard back to the ship has failed my options are narrowing and my patience is all but gone

heres the situation on eladrel the entity has moved off several hundred metres
captain picards bioscan readings are stable the tamarians are not
he may be injured
if the entity decides to attack again the captain may be facing it alone
the transporters out of the question the tamarian ship has deepened the scattering field to the d region of the ionosphere theres no getting through
unless we attack the ship itself
are you able to pinpoint the source of their particle beam
theyre using a polarity coil generator located aft of their warp drive its pretty heavily shielded
could we get through with our phasers
not with the first spread itd take a couple of hits
thats not good enough we need to knock out the scattering field in one shot and have the captain back on the enterprise before they know what happened
if we selectively target the amplification pathways around the generator it should be just as effective and we can do it in one burst
how long will it take to set up
worf and i would have to adjust the prefire chamber thatll give us the focus we need a few hours
make it so

i would prefer to find a peaceful solution if we could talk our way out of this one that much the better
unfortunately it may not be that simple
what did you find out
the tamarian ego structure does not seem to allow what we normally think of as selfidentity their ability to abstract is highly unusual they seem to communicate through narrative imagery by reference to the individuals and places which appear in their mythohistorical accounts
its as if i were to say to you juliet on her balcony
an image of romance
exactly imagery is everything to the tamarians it embodies their emotional states their very thought processes its how they communicate and its how they think
if we know how they think shouldnt we be able to get something across to them
no sir the situation is analogous to understanding the grammar of a language but none of the vocabulary
if i didnt know who juliet was or what she was doing on that balcony the image alone wouldnt have any meaning
thats correct for instance we know that darmok was a great hero a hunter and that tanagra was an island but thats it without the details theres no understanding
it is necessary for us to learn the narrative from which the tamarians drawing their imagery given our current relations that does not appear likely


darmok and jalad at tanagra
our situation is similar to theirs i understand that but i need to know more you must tell me more about darmok and jalad tell me you used the words temba his arms wide when you gave me the knife and the fire could that mean give temba his arms wide darmok give me more about darmok

kira at bashi temba his arms wide
my turn no im not much of a story teller besides you wouldnt understand shaka when the walls fell perhaps that doesnt matter you want to hear it anyway theres a story a very ancient one from earth ill try and remember it gilgamesh a king gilgamesh a king at uruk he tormented his subjects he made them angry they cried out aloud send us a companion for our king spare us from his madness enkidu a wild man from the forest entered the city they fought in the temple they fought in the street gilgamesh defeated enkidu they became great friends gilgamesh and enkidu at uruk
at uruk
the new friends went out into the desert together where the great bull of heaven was killing men by the hundreds enkidu caught the bull by the tail gilgamesh struck it with his sword
gilgamesh
they were victorious but enkidu fell to the ground struck down by the gods and gilgamesh wept bitter tears saying he who was my companion through adventure and hardship is gone forever

thank you
greek sir
oh the homeric hymns one of the root metaphors of our own culture
for the next time we encounter the tamarians
more familiarity with our own mythology might help us to relate to theirs the tamarian was willing to risk all of us just for the hope of communication connection now the door is open between our peoples that commitment meant more to him than his own life thank you number one
ensign ro



theres a time when you want to call a romulans bluff and theres a time when you dont wouldnt you say
well one does not always have the luxury
youve got to choose your time and place with them true or false
yes wherever possible
so this time you were lucky i suppose alls well that ends well but if id been in your shoes
well you know that really does look very nice mister mot i think that will be sufficient
hold on  there i must tell you captain will riker was in for a trim yesterday and he agrees with me a hundred per cent
bridge to captain picard
yes
sorry to interrupt

were receiving an emergency distress signal from the solarion four colony

uh oh thats right along the cardassian border
lay in a new course im on my way

i told him we shouldnt colonise so close to the cardassians

report
the signal ended abruptly at oh four five five unable to raise them on subspace
hail them on upper and lower band frequencies mister worf
ive tried no response
time to the solarion system
twenty six minutes captain
i understand youve been discussing alternative adversarial engagement strategy with mister mot
it would be more accurate to say he was discussing them with me hes the best barber in starfleet what can you do
sir receiving another signal of a vessel leaving orbit of solarion four new frequency low band audio only
open a channel
this is the bajora we claim responsibility for the destruction of the federation colony on solarion four as long as we are without our homeland no one will be safe in this sector
captains log stardate  we have arrived at lya station alpha with survivors from solarion four admiral kennelly has rendezvoused to discuss the bajoran terrorist attack


sorry
ginger tea with honey eighty degrees celsius
ginger tea
my aunt adeles cure for the common cold
common hell i picked this up from the cardassian liaison last weekend its some damn virus theyve sicked on me
did he have anything to say about this attack
its the same old story for the cardassians theyve had terrorist problems ever since they annexed the bajoran home world forty years ago
but in forty years theyve never attacked a federation target
a new militant splinter group has broken away from the bajoran settlement camps the leaders name is orta apparently hes willing to do whatever he has to to get attention
and our response
listen jeanluc im the first to say that the bajora deserve attention chased off their own planet by the cardassians forced to wander the galaxy settling wherever they can find room its tragic
on many worlds weve been to they are isolated treated as pariahs
the federation is sympathetic to their cause but theyre not helping themselves with an attack like this thats what i want you to communicate to them
but this could be done through diplomatic channels admiral what do you really want of us
find this terrorist leader orta and get him back where he belongs any way you can
any way i can
the federation has dozens of settlements in that sector we can not allow the violence to continue
and what do i have to offer orta that might persuade him to cooperate
amnesty
admiral
and a promise that we will immediately begin to address this issue with the cardassians quietly behind the scenes using every legitimate means possible but the bajora must be patient
admiral theyve endured generations of sympathy and promises how can i believe this orta will be satisfied with more of the same
its your job to see to it that he does jeanluc
riker to captain picard
go ahead
have you approved

the transfer of a new officer to the enterprise
negative
well weve got one waiting to beam aboard complete with orders

ensign ro laren
ro laren from the wellington
 the same one sir shall i tell her theres been some mistake
stand by commander
i wrote the orders i thought she might be valuable to you
admiral respectfully i would appreciate consulting rights on the assignment of a new officer especially one with the record of ro laren
shes bajoran
there are other bajorans in starfleet assign one of them
ive discussed this situation with her and i am convinced that she is the right one for this job
after what happened on garon two she has no business serving on any starship let alone the flagship my ship
youre taking her captain its been arranged i cant tell you how difficult it was to get her out of prison
its that important to you
its that important to the mission
picard to riker
go ahead
proceed with the transport
sir
ill fill you in later
yes sir
i hope you and i dont regret this admiral
you can handle her captain if anyone can


ensign ro laren reporting as ordered commander
you will follow starfleet uniform code aboard this ship ensign


there will be members of this crew who will not want to serve with ensign laren sir
theyll have to learn to live with it
i intend to demand the highest level of performance from her
i would expect nothing less it wont be for long will  come

yes ensign laren please have a seat
ensign ro sir
i beg your pardon
the bajoran custom has the family name first the individuals second i am properly addressed as ensign ro
im sorry i didnt know
no theres no reason you should its an old custom most bajora these days accept the distortion of their names in order to assimilate i do not
i wish to be candid with you ensign
please
im fully aware of your starfleet record your problems on other ships and the incident on garon two that led to your court martial and im concerned about your presence on this delicate mission
i dont want to be here any more than you want me to be here sir
then why did you accept this assignment
if i may be equally candid its better than prison
better than prison there are officers who wait years to serve on this ship
being called back into starfleet was not my idea
nor ours
nevertheless we will all be serving together commander riker and i have expectations of you
captain i know the routine you dont have to worry about me were stuck with each other so lets just get this over with as quickly as possible and we can go our own separate ways okay

dismissed
captains log supplemental we are approaching the valo system on the outskirts of cardassian territory where many bajorans have resettled

there are dozens of bajoran camps on the three classm planets i suggest we may want to begin on valo three where an adhoc leader named jas holza lives the federation has had several dealings with him
i met holza at a symposium a few years ago
what can you tell us about him doctor
i found him to be a very concerned leader and a good spokesman for his people and a terrific dancer no really im serious at a reception afterwards
at least this man has genuine experience in diplomacy
and thats a big advantage on this mission very well mister data will you contact holza arrange a meeting
sir
ensign ro youre familiar with this star system youll take the conn is there a problem ensign
youre wasting your time holza is nobody hes the token bajoran that respectable people invite to symposiums and diplomatic soirees but he has no real influence among my people
ensign whom do you suggest we speak to
dont you understand these are desperate people ready to martyr themselves they dont want to talk
this ship is prepared to defend itself if necessary
oh it will be dont fool yourself this mission will end in bloodshed
well lets hope that youre mistaken ensign but can you point us at the right individual as mister data suggested
i would go to the camp on the southern continent of valo two find a man named keeve falor he has no diplomatic experience and he wont ask you to dance
captains log supplemental i read about the achievements of the ancient bajoran civilisation in my fifth grade reader they were architects and artists builders and philosophers when humans were not yet standing erect now i see how history has rewarded them


this used to be me
baleekam balleek balleek baleekam baleek

ro laren its been a long time
keeve falor captain jeanluc picard commander data and lieutenant worf
im pleased you agreed to meet with us mister keeve
you honour me by the proper use of my name captain
ensign ro has educated me
has she im pleased you still remember let me show you our camp we are not a violent race captain just passionate about our cause and that passion has led some to take up arms
do you know where we can find orta
im afraid not
can you help us locate him
im sorry i dont wish to help you dont misunderstand i for one believe the raid on the federation outpost was poor judgment you are innocent bystanders and i cannot condone violence against those who are not our enemies
then i dont understand why you are unwilling
because you are innocent bystanders you were innocent bystanders for decades as the cardassians took our homes as they violated and tortured our people in the most hideous ways imaginable as we were forced to flee
we were saddened by those events but they occurred within the designated borders of the cardassian empire
and the federation is pledged not to interfere in the internal affairs of others how convenient that must be for you to turn a deaf ear to those who suffer behind a line on a map
well im not here to debate federation policy with you but i can offer you assistance
simply because of one terrorist attack perhaps i should have known that we should have attacked the federation long ago what do you think of that ro
i think youre a small man who feels a rush of power in his belly and enjoys it far too much keeve stop talking and listen
weve had our problems with the cardassians too but now that we have a treaty were in a position to help your people have been forced to resettle all over the quadrant but now we can make a legitimate case with the cardassians that this is not an isolated problem we can work diplomatically on your behalf but first these terrorist attacks must end
we live in different universes you and i yours is about diplomacy politics strategy mine is about blankets if we were to exchange places for one night you might better understand
mister data see to it that the replicators provide a blanket for every man woman and child before nightfall
aye sir

mister worf determine what these people may have in the way of emergency needs and provide for them
yes sir

thank you return to your ship i will contact you when i have any information that might be of assistance to you ensign

you were helpful
the blankets were helpful nothing i said mattered
in an age when their technology should be able to clothe and feed all of them that they should have to live like this
i couldnt and i wouldnt thats one reason i ran away theyre lost defeated i will never be
captains log stardate  keeve falor has kept his promise and directed us toward the third moon of valo one where we will meet tomorrow with the terrorist leader orta


do you mind if we join you
yes

 ill tell you one thing if i find myself on an away team with ensign ro i wont turn my back on her
perhaps the captain thought shed be valuable on the mission
that was orders had to be she doesnt belong here she doesnt even belong in the uniform as far as im concerned
really
really
sounds like someone id like to know excuse me

am i disturbing you
yes
good you look like someone who wants to be disturbed
id rather be alone
oh no you wouldnt
i beg your pardon
if you wanted to be alone you wouldve stayed in your quarters the only reason to come here is to be amongst people
who are you
my name is guinan i tend bar and i listen
heard anything interesting
everyones talking about you
heard anything interesting
mmm hmm
well its all true
i believe truth is in the eye of the beholder
isnt that supposed to be beauty
truth beauty it works for a lot of things they say you never told the true story about galon two they also say you didnt defend yourself at your court martial
what was to defend i didnt follow orders eight members of the away team died
your fault
yeah my fault
so you sit alone in crowded rooms staring at your drink i think you enjoy it
i enjoy it
you work so hard at torturing yourself i can only think you must enjoy it
who are you
i told you im guinan i tend bar and i listen
youre not like any bartender i ever met before
and youre not like any starfleet officer ive ever met before but that sounds like the beginning of a very interesting friendship
i dont stay anywhere long enough to make friends
too late you just did excuse me
bridge to ensign ro
go ahead
subspace communication coming in for you ensign
thank you

computer direct subspace transmission to monitor
your report ensign
everything is going exactly as you predicted admiral

any indications of weapons or vessels beneath the surface
the composition of the moons crust is blocking the sensors
which is very likely why they chose this moon for their base of operations

were on a timetable here wheres ro
captain picard to ensign ro
computer locate ensign ro
ensign ro is not on board the enterprise
check the transport log
she beamed down almost six hours ago sir
any activity at the meeting site
no sir they didnt show up
what the hell is going on
prepare to transport us to the same location ensign ro beamed to mister worf phasers

i am picking up molecular displacement traces that suggests movement through this area during the last ten hours
see if we can determine their direction standard search pattern
maintain tricorder security link
mister worf you come with me
data im picking up energy fluctuations over here troi to picard captain acknowledge
data to picard data to worf

hold it


captain picard i am orta please forgive my appearance unfortunately some years ago as a guest of the cardassians my face was mutilated my vocal cords were cut
it was not necessary to abduct us
i am sorry but after speaking with ro laren i decided that it was
then she has done us both a disservice i am committed to peace
i am not at all interested in peace and i am not convinced you are either
captain i did not come here to undermine this mission
whatever your motives youve already done enough to damage these negotiations
i came here to convince these people to listen to you i didnt want this to end in bloodshed
there will be no bloodshed
you dont know all the facts sir
then perhaps you would share them with me ensign
all is not what it seems to be captain perhaps someone is using you to get to me perhaps you are a victim of this deception as well i do not know
deception
your mission was to seek out the bajoran terrorists who destroyed the federation settlement on solarion four
yes
as i have informed ro laren it was not the bajora

he admits responsibility for dozens of attacks on cardassian targets why should we believe him about solarion four
he has no reason to lie
he fears our reprisal
i perceived no fear or deception from him
if they did not attack solarion four then who did and why would anyone want to falsely implicate the bajora
perhaps someone wanted to draw us into the conflict
what would anyone gain by doing that
ensign ro may i see you in my ready room
yes sir

you do not leave this ship without authorisation
captain im sorry but i
this is not a discussion youre restricted to your quarters for the remainder of this mission dismissed


what

hello its me guinan i heard you got grounded
i really dont feel like talking right now
come on sure you do
why is it every time i tell you something you tell me i mean the exact opposite
because youre one of those people whos got their poles reversed do you want to talk about it
its nothing you can help me with
how do you know until you try
look i got myself into this im just trying to figure a way out thats all without anyone getting killed this time seems like everybodys just pulling my strings you know like ive got no control
for people like you and me whove lost their homes sometimes thats the way life feels
im in trouble theres more going on here than anybody on this ship realises its more than i know how to deal with and i really dont know who to trust anymore
including yourself
especially myself
you know a very long time ago i got into some serious trouble too and i mean serious and id probably still be there if i hadnt trusted one man

come

ensign ro has some things shed like to talk to you about
ensign ro has been confined to her quarters
well she can go back to her quarters when shes done
guinan i dont know why you are involved in this but
shes my friend

please sit down guinan is very selective about whom she calls a friend
sir when im finished telling you what i have to tell you im probably going to end up back in the stockade one way or the other and if thats how this has to be then i just cant do this anymore
what can you not do anymore ensign
admiral kennelly came to me in prison and told me hed arrange to get me out if id go on a mission
i know that part
no sir not this mission one for him and only him you were being sent to talk to negotiate the admiral knew that was hopeless my job was to give orta an incentive
what kind of incentive
one that you couldnt offer one that starfleet couldnt offer orta was to end the terrorism against the federation and return with his people to the camps in exchange he would get weapons ships things that would really make a difference against the cardassians in the future
i find that almost impossible to believe that admiral kennelly would consider supplying weapons to the terrorists
if you ask him hell deny it but its true i didnt leave the ship without authorisation captain i received it from the admiral last night
you have been in contact with admiral kennelly during this mission
yes sir the subspace log can confirm that part of it at least
arming these people is a violation of everything that the federation stands for even you cannot be blind to that
no sir im not but this was something i had to do you see captain when i was seven years old i was given a piece of sugar candy and i was led by a cardassian into a room where my father was sitting and he looked at me with eyes id never seen the cardassian began to ask him questions and during the next two hours as i was forced to watch my father was tortured until he died and i remember feeling so ashamed of him as he begged for mercy i was ashamed of him for being weak i was ashamed of being bajoran later i began to understand how misguided those feelings were and yet somehow they have remained a part of me i dont want to be ashamed of my heritage any longer captain i serve the federation but i am bajoran a starfleet admiral presented me with an opportunity to help my people in their fight against the cardassians i had to accept it
have you made this offer to orta
no after he told me the bajora hadnt attacked solarion four nothing made sense anymore i decided to wait until i could figure out what was going on
that was a wise choice ensign it probably saved you from another court martial have you briefed admiral kennelly since we returned from the surface
no sir captain i dont know who to trust anymore but that strange bartender of yours has a way of getting to you and she said that you were her friend
then we have one thing in common do you think that orta would cooperate with us to determine the truth here
i think i could persuade him to
good our orders were to find him to bring him back to the camps any way we could perhaps that is exactly what we should do
and then what
and then watch what happens
captains log supplemental i have become convinced that we are somehow involved in a conspiracy i am hopeful the purpose behind it will be revealed in the next few hours

well done captain
it was a team effort admiral ensign ro was invaluable
good whats the next step
the enterprise will escort a bajoran antares class carrier to the valo three camp at oh five hundred hours orta and his people will be aboard
good keep us advised of your progress
acknowledged hows that cardassian virus admiral
a lot better thank you
im pleased we will report as soon as our mission is accomplished picard out
ensign ro take us to the designated coordinates
aye sir
mister data keep an eye on the cardassian border
aye sir

the bajoran vessel is moving up from the surface captain
on screen hail them mister worf
audio channel open the ship does not have visual capabilities
this is captain picard were prepared to escort you to valo three
acknowledged captain be advised that our ship is limited to half impulse
ensign ro set a course for valo three half impulse
aye sir

i am monitoring increased activity inside cardassian space two ships are moving along the border heading one four two mark zero five one
can you identify the class of these ships mister worf
cardassian warships galor class type three
top of the line
they are moving into a course parallel to our own captain
yellow alert continue to monitor them
ensign ro whats the closest we come to the cardassian border on our current heading to valo three
thirteen thousand four hundred kilometres sir
eta
eight minutes
thats where it will be

the cardassian ships are changing course sir they are crossing the border
theyre increasing power to their forward weapon grid
red alert
ensign ro set a course to intercept the cardassians mister worf open a channel to the bajoran vessel
open
this is the enterprise we are moving to intercept two cardassian warships maintain your present course and speed
acknowledged enterprise
the cardassians are within visual range
on screen
they are hailing us sir
open a channel mister worf this is captain jeanluc picard of the federation starship enterprise how can we help you
gul dolak cardassian militia four one we have no argument with you captain
im pleased to hear that gul dolak for all of us in the federation value the peaceful relations with our cardassian neighbours
no more than we value the relations with our federation neighbours
well now that weve established our mutual good will whats on your mind
we have identified the bajoran ship you are escorting as a terrorist carrier
terrorist carrier are you certain
most certain captain it has committed many crimes against us we know its markings well
rest assured gul dolak there will be no terrorist attacks today we are escorting the bajoran settlers to their camp on valo three you can monitor their course if you wish
we would request that you withdraw and leave the matter to us
this is neutral space gul dolak you have no jurisdiction here
nor do you
if we withdraw what do you intend to do with the bajoran vessel
we intend to destroy it
i see that puts me in a difficult position i promised to escort these people to their camps
you are protecting the enemies of the cardassian people if you do not withdraw we will take great offence
im sorry to offend you gul dolak but we cannot withdraw
we are prepared to take any steps necessary
is that intended as a threat
it is a complaint from your cardassian neighbours you have one hour to withdraw

advise starfleet of our status mister data when admiral kennelly calls ill speak to him in my ready room

it seemed admiral that they knew our course our destination our plan
im sure they monitor the border at all times for terrorist activity their sensors must picked up ortas ship thats all
im not convinced of that
the important thing is what do we do now
do you have any suggestions admiral
your top priority is to protect the cardassian treaty
sir i see no way to protect the cardassian peace without sacrificing the bajorans
if thats your call ill support it
no im not willing to give them up
i dont think youre looking at the big picture jeanluc we cant afford to lose the cardassian treaty
well i just see a different big picture admiral it looks something like this i see the cardassian liaison with his cardassian virus coming to meet with you after the attack on solarion four now we have a common enemy he says the bajoran terrorists the cardassians cant find them but maybe the federation can im beginning to see that our mission has in fact been to expose orta so that the cardassians can move in and destroy him
i think youve lost your perspective captain well discuss this further when you return for now im giving you a direct order to withdraw kennelly out

ensign ro set a course bearing one eight seven mark one zero two one quarter impulse
aye sir
hes ordered us to withdraw
the cardassians are moving toward the bajoran vessel captain
hold present course
the bajoran ship has been destroyed
subspace signal coming from starfleet captain admiral kennelly
on screen
it is on a secure channel sir in your ready room
no here on screen
report
the cardassians have destroyed the bajoran ship admiral
all hands lost
no sir
survivors
no sir no one was on board
what are you talking about
the ship was controlled from the ground communication was handled through a subspace relay on board the vessel
this was your idea picard
actually no it was ensign ros idea but i fully endorsed it i suspected that something like this might occur
theyre terrorists damn it why in the hell would you want to protect them
admiral i am more concerned with protecting the honour and integrity of starfleet
do you know how many of our people they killed on solarion four
the bajorans did not attack solarion four
who told you that orta
yes
and you believed him
admiral ortas ships are old and obsolete they dont even have warp capabilities they couldnt have reached another star system let alone attacked one
but then whos responsible
i would suggest you ask your friend the cardassian liaison admiral the only explanation i can think of is that the cardassians staged it
the cardassians why
perhaps they were hoping to find someone in starfleet like you admiral naive enough to solve their bajoran problem for them

what will happen to him
im not sure a hearing certainly probably a court martial
well if hes sent to the stockade on jaros two tell him to request a room in the east wing the west wing gets awfully hot in the afternoons how soon do you intend to return to lya station alpha sir
in a few weeks we have some surveying to do in sector two one three oh five
perhaps i should arrange for some other transportation back
ensign you were recruited for one mission and if you wish to be relieved of further duty i can certainly arrange it but id like you to consider remaining in starfleet
youre not serious
i think it would be a shame for starfleet to lose someone of your potential
well thank you captain but this uniform just doesnt fit and you know it
that can change
i dont think so
ive noticed qualities in you that could be harnessed moulded
dont count on it
i think youve got a great deal to learn from starfleet
i always thought starfleet had a lot to learn from me captain
that is an attitude ive found common among the best officers ive ever served with youre not one of them yet but you could be if you work at it
thats an interesting challenge and i rarely refuse an interesting challenge there would have to be one condition
condition

picard to enterprise two to beam up
silicon avatar



the hospital facility will be located there facing north in that grove of trees and the school and the arts centre will be standing there centrally located among the residential pods
very good at this rate well be able to bring the next wave of colonists in in about six months ive to tell you i envy you this is a beautiful place to put down roots
somehow riker you dont strike me as the kind that puts down roots
no how do i strike you
as a free spirit an adventurer
an adventurer arent you pioneers adventurers at heart
of course but we also have this nesting instinct its exciting to find a new world but the joy comes in making it a home building houses having children
very interesting id love to discuss this further with you dinner tonight
if you want to share camp rations in my tent id be delighted
havent we gotten you a replicator yet
no we havent but ive been saving my ration of dried chicken curry it should go very nicely with that bottle of wine i happen to know you brought with you
this is sounding better all the time
and as you know i provide the most memorable desserts
my favourite part of dinner
will carmen weve been going over the schematics for the hospital the location seems fine
when the enterprise comes back tomorrow well get a crew started on that

carmen have you got construction started i didnt know about
no what is that
data
i do not recognise the sound i believe it is coming from above

will what is it
data whats our best bet for cover
subterranean caverns to the east sir doctor

will
start gathering everybody together weve seen this before we know what it is now get moving


follow him lets go come on come on

no stay together stay together this way this way this way

ive got you

will help us
data  carmen


captain sensors indicate a disturbance near the outpost on melona four
what kind of disturbance
i cannot tell we are still too far away it could be an electrical storm
see if you can contact the colony
aye sir captain there is no response from melona colony but the disturbance in the atmosphere is increasing
how far are we
at current speed twenty seven hours
bridge to la forge
la forge here captain
are you picking up any readings from melona

yes sir something strange is going on there are violent disruptions in the atmosphere

ensign increase to warp eight

come on keep moving


watch your step but keep moving
lets go lets go keep moving deeper into the cave come on deeper into the cave keep moving

how much protection will this cave give us
the refractory metal in the rock formations may act as an effective barrier
lets seal off this entrance

lets hope theres enough air in here
theres got to be a ventilation source somewhere we need some light

how are the others
just scrapes and bruises i think ill check further wheres carmen
she didnt make it she was trying to save an old man whod fallen
im sorry
i think were going to be all right in here im not sure about the air supply so stay put dont move around dont expend unnecessary energy with any luck well be able to wait this thing out
riker to enterprise riker to enterprise
commander the refractory metals in the rock strata may also interfere with communication
data weve only seen the crystalline entity once before how do you know these metals will protect us
i am not entirely certain they will sir
i was afraid you were going to say something like that

sir the disturbance on melona is becoming more intense
keep hailing them all channels mister worf
captain the fact that theyre not responding doesnt necessarily mean theres anything wrong the atmospheric disturbance could be jamming the signal
i know counsellor
still no response sir
increase to warp nine how long mister worf
six hours


ive got one man unconscious we cant stay in here much longer
if i open that entrance and its still out there were dead
if we all stay in here were dead
it has been over an hour since we heard the entity sir it may be gone
or it may be out there waiting for us

everybody stay here

commander commander riker are you there
lieutenant worf i dont think ive ever seen a more beautiful sight
its good to see youre all right commander whats happened here
the crystalline entity paid us a visit we lost two colonists but we got the rest in here

captains log stardate  we have notified starfleet command of our intention to pursue and investigate the crystalline entity to that end we have been joined by doctor kila marr a xenologist who has made studying the entity her lifes work


welcome to the enterprise i am commander william riker
commander doctor kila marr
glad youre here
you were on the surface during the attack
thats right
remarkable you and your group are the only known beings ever to survive an assault by the crystalline entity
we were lucky
i should say and your android he was there too
lieutenant commander data was there yes
well shall we get started
id be glad to show you to your quarters

oh commander a chance to talk to survivors so soon after an attack ive been waiting years for this i dont want to waste a moment more

and when we came out of the cave there was nothing left everywhere we looked there was complete devastation trees gone nothing
thats typical it could take years for anything to grow again
doctor i ran a full spectrographic analysis section by section trace elements confirm that it is the same entity which destroyed the colony at omicron theta
the crystalline entity seems to function like a gigantic electromagnetic collector it needs a lot of power to keep going so it strips every form of life from the worlds it encounters and converts it all into energy
theres no vegetation no insects not even soil bacteria it left nothing
except witnesses for the first time in eleven recorded attacks now why i wonder did it spare your group
it didnt spare everyone doctor if youll check your reports youll find that two of the colonists didnt survive
my point is that until now there have never been any survivors
doctor the cave in which we hid was made of rock which contained heavy concentrations of kelbonite and fistrium we surmise that the entity was unable to penetrate that barrier
i would like to do interviews with each of the survivors collect as much specific detail as i can of their observations
of course
and id like to inspect the remains of melona colony as soon as possible
commander data you will accompany the doctor to the surface
yes sir
if you dont mind captain i prefer to choose my own team
doctor there is no one on this ship with more knowledge of the crystalline entity than commander data he originated on omicron theta
i am aware of his origins im very much aware that his brother lore worked with the crystalline entity led it to omicron theta where it killed every living thing i dont think its unreasonable that i should prefer to make another choice
you may request additional team members but in the best interest of this investigation i think you should work with commander data
as you wish captain

well
i dont think you need an empath to sense that womans feelings theres hostility that she seems to have transferred from lore to data perhaps you shouldnt have forced them together so soon
if her discomfort is going to affect her judgement or her objectivity i need to know now

doctor there is evidence of residual bitrious matter in the soil it was not present before the entitys attack

doctor doctor marr you have made it clear that my presence disturbs you however i do not see how we can achieve our task if you continue to ignore me
commander i can hear everything you say to me if there is anything worth my response you can be sure i will not be silent
then i do not understand your lack of interest in the bitrious filament i mentioned
its old news to me i found evidence of bitrium on the last three attack sites it seems to be a residual that the entity produces after it absorbs living matter im actually more interested in this cave it still amazes me that your group was spared
as i have speculated the presence of refractory metals
refractory metals yes i know on two separate occasions settlers sought refuge in caves some of them deeper than this one they perished anyway
were those caves laced with kelbonite or fistrium
the tunnels on forlat three had strong deposits of kelbonite yes
then perhaps the combination of the two metals prevented the entity from
perhaps it was you
i do not understand
maybe it was your presence which made the entity pass over the people in this cave did that occur to you
i cannot see what effect my being here would have had
if you had been in contact with the entity if thats the reason melona was attacked it surely wouldnt have killed its ally
do you believe that i lured the entity here
did you
no doctor because lore betrayed the colonists on omicron theta you believe that i am capable of the same behaviour you are mistaken doctor my programming is distinctly different from lores
you dont understand i am accusing you of collaborating with that monster
i do understand and i am attempting to explain to you it is impossible
its amazing you cant feel anything can you nothing i say to you hurts you
that is true doctor
im getting a slight elevation on monocaladium particulates in this cave wall are you making note of it
yes doctor
my son died on omicron theta he was sixteen when the colony was attacked that is the reason i have became an expert on the crystalline entity i have spent my life studying it tracking it and hoping someday to find it and if i learn you have been helping that thing in any way whatsoever i will see to it that you are disassembled piece by piece

okay doctor weve input all the data you collected on the surface
just a minute commander i have some cellulose readings from soil samples that werent included

you handle that unit like a veteran doctor
one thing about spending your life gathering information you learn your way around computers hydrocarbons slightly elevated bitrious filaments in trace amounts lanthanides nitrates all normal nothing different everything falls within the parameters i established at the other attack sites
were you expecting a different result this time doctor
ive never surveyed a site so soon after an attack i thought maybe id find something new something that would make a difference
doctor have you ever scanned your samples for gamma radiation
why would i do that
we are seeing high energy reactions that may show up in a gamma scan
and if they do we might find a pattern a kind of marker left behind by the entity thats a good idea data
frankly i just dont see what that would get us
if the entity left a residual trace of antiproton in the samples we collected a gamma radiation scan would reveal that
getting that readout now data
if we try a logarithmic scale we will have better resolution
there it is do you see it
yes doctor
a sharp spike at ten kev another a pattern
so we know the entity leaves antiprotons behind
if it also deposits antiprotons in space as it travels can we detect them
sure we can set the ships lateral sensors for gamma radiation
well lets get to it shall we

it seems i owe you thanks commander
the thanks actually go to doctor clendenning on omicron theta who did the first experiments with gamma scans
ive never read that it wasnt in any of his records
that is correct but i possess much of his knowledge he was working on new detectors at the time of the attack on omicron theta

id heard that youd been programmed with the experiences of the colonists but frankly i find it hard to believe bridge
it is true doctor the contents of their logs and journals were transferred into my memory cells the man who created me also experimented with scanning the synaptic patterns of the colonists temporal lobes and programming them into my neural nets
you possess their thoughts
to some degree doctor soong hoped to provide me with an amalgam of the colonists memories
interesting


there a spike at ten kev and again its the same pattern we saw in engineering
mister data can you project a course from it
yes sir there are two possible destinations the brechtian cluster and the argos system
is either populated
yes sir the brechtian cluster has two inhabited planets
ensign set a course for the brechtian cluster
captain ive done some preliminary estimates on the firing pattern we need in order to destroy the entity the photon torpedoes will require some reprogramming but with your permission ill give the calculations to lieutenant worf
reprogram the torpedoes mister worf lets hope we dont have to use them
i beg your pardon
if we can possibly avoid firing on it i would hope it would be
you arent going to kill it
perhaps you should join me in my ready room

i dont understand why are we pursuing the entity if not to destroy it
were not hunters doctor nor is it our role to exact revenge
what do you propose we track it down greet it warmly and ask if it would mind terribly not ravaging any more planets
i dont denying that it may be necessary to fire on it but i look on that as a last resort
why why not just kill it
i want to try to communicate with it
what
we know from our own experience that our shields will protect us so long as were in no danger i will make every effort to communicate
to what end
if we can determine what its needs are we might find other sources to supply it
its needs are to slaughter people by the thousands it is nothing but a giant killing machine
doctor the sperm whale on earth devours millions of cuttlefish as it roams the oceans it is not evil it is feeding the same may be true of the crystalline entity
that would be small comfort for those who have died to feed it were not talking about cuttlefish were talking about people
i would argue that the crystalline entity has as much right to be here as we do now commander data has some theories on how we might communicate please confer with him


come in
am i disturbing you
not at all doctor
commander theres something i want to say you have been helpful to me and kind and i repaid you with accusations and i realise i may have been wrong
that is very gracious of you to say doctor but i have not been injured by you
captain picard has told me youve done work in trying to establish communication with the entity
that is true i have experimented with producing vibrations in crystals by means of graviton pulses
like tapping a crystal goblet
exactly i will call up the results i have achieved this far for you to study
all right commander just what kind of memories do you retain of the colonists
i do not possess the minute to minute remembrances of each person although the more intense recollections are contained in my memory banks
do you have any of my sons memories
marr raymond called renny yes i do
i see and his journals
yes
i was wondering do you know did he blame me
blame you
for going away for leaving him on omicron theta
there are no records of any blame against you
i left him with friends i chose to pursue my own career i planned to go back but things kept interfering i kept thinking ill go next month and there werent any more next months
there are no records of any negative thoughts about you his personal journals indicated that he was proud that you were such a fine scientist
he was what else do you know
commander data doctor marr report to the bridge immediately

we are being chased by an unidentified entity travelling at warp speed
a distress call from a ship called the kallisko its being pursued by an unknown object
sensors indicate a crystalline structure of indeterminate mass
how strong are your shields captain
we are a transport ship our shields are minimal
do you carry weapons
only low level particle phasers do you know what this being is
kallisko change course take evasive action do whatever you can to outrun it
we are under attack captain notify our people on boreal three

mister worf try to reestablish
i cannot sir there is no response
the crystalline entity is moving away sir
ensign set a course for the kallisko mister riker prepare an away team
captains log stardate  an away team led by commander riker has conducted a thorough survey of the alien ship kallisko and has returned to the enterprise to report

it was pretty much as we expected sir no survivors
not a trace of anything that was ever alive not even a seed in their greenery storage
warp and impulse engines are down sir but they can be restarted a skeleton crew could take the ship to a starbase
no we dont have time for that now mister worf send a message to the nearest starbase ask them to dispatch a crew
aye sir
mister la forge make certain that were still picking up the gamma radiation pattern of the entity
aye sir
have you and commander data made any progress in finding a means of communication
i believe so there are some details to iron out
please keep working at it we may need it soon

deck seventeen doctor you have seemed preoccupied since we surveyed the kallisko
ive found it easy to talk to you commander do you mind if i tell you something
not at all
after hearing the screams of those men i found it hard not to think about my son about what happened to him ive read stories about soldiers in the battlefield wounded dying they call for their mothers and ive often wondered if my son called for me if he died wondering why i didnt come to him

come

its still headed for the brechtian cluster weve reestablished our course
very well oh one thing number one starfleet will be notifying carmen davilas family of her death and returning her personal effects would you care to enclose a letter
yes sir id like that very much
is there something more number one
permission to speak freely sir
of course
ive been thinking maybe doctor marr is right maybe we should destroy the entity
why do you think that
its already killed thousands it will undoubtedly continue to kill unless we stop it i dont want those deaths on my conscience
are you sure that thats it number one or are you being influenced by personal feelings
with all due respect sir im not a raw cadet ive lost people on missions before if we take time to try to communicate with this thing we may lose our chance to destroy it and i dont think we can risk that i think ill go write that letter to carmens family

we should programme the bridge science station to vary the emissions we direct toward the entity
ill write a subroutine that will allow us to change the frequency of the graviton beam data you told me you carried some of my sons memories
that is correct doctor
what can you tell me about renny what were those thoughts was he was he happy at all on omicron theta
i have some vivid memories of sporting events he played parrises squares with a group of his schoolmates
renny started parrises squares when he was young too young really but the older children kept asking him to play and i couldnt keep him away he had this natural gift
yes he was pleased to have won a championship emblem
i remember he wrote me about that he was so proud im characterising pulse widths in nanoseconds sound right to you
yes doctor your sons most intense memories revolve around a young woman named jenina
a girlfriend i never knew about that of course the last person he would tell would be his mother what was she like
he enjoyed her kindness her gentleness her physical attributes
there now we can vary all the parameters directly from the bridge
yes doctor
could you do something for me it would mean a lot
i would be happy to be of help
you see all i have left of renny the only connection of him is there inside you i was wondering if you would talk to me in his voice i know you have the ability to sound like other people isnt that right
that is true doctor but what would you want me to say
maybe something from his journals
many of his journal entries took the form of letters to friends and family i could access one of those
 i took my last exam today i think i did all right on everything except cellular biology i know you think its important mom but i dont see how im ever going to use this stuff in a couple of weeks a bunch of us are going on an archaeological dig in the mountains the wallaces said it would be all right as long as we had adult supervision so dont worry theyre looking out for me theyre really great people and i like them a lot but theyre kind of serious they dont have your sense of humour mom mom i miss you
captains log stardate  we are still in pursuit of the crystalline entity data and doctor marr are prepared to attempt communication with the being when we intercept it i will admit to some uncertainty about the prospect it could prove to be a scientific triumph or a catastrophe

sir the brechtian cluster is now five light years away
are we still picking up the entitys pattern
yes commander but sensors have not yet locked onto its exact whereabouts
captain we are reasonably sure its between here and the brechtian cluster if i start emitting the graviton beam now it may serve as a lure a kind of beacon
make it so
well start with a pulse width of five nanoseconds frequency one pulse per second
commencing graviton emissions now

no change in the sensor readings
lets ramp frequency
emissions now at ten pulses per second
sir
what is it do you have something
a large mass approaching at warp speed
full stop
aye sir
doctor continue emitting the signals mister worf on screen
shields up
magnify
its beautiful
whats it doing checking us out
possibly just as were checking it out
doctor marr do you wish to change the frequency doctor marr
yes yes proceed commander
changing to twenty pulses per second

is it responding to us
lets test that ramp the frequency again commander
emissions now at thirty pulses per second
captain im reading a transmission from the entity a series of graviton pulses
its working thats a response to our signal
remarkable
captain there is a pattern emerging from the signals
its trying to communicate with us
i believe so sir but it will take some time to decipher the patterns
then its possible communication understanding
let me try something else a continuous graviton beam
all graviton pulses from the entity have stopped
maybe it doesnt like what were doing
doctor return to the intermittent signal

doctor doctor marr doctor marr we must return to the intermittent signal
counsellor
somethings very wrong captain
sir the entity is beginning to resonate vibrations are increasing
doctor stop the transmission that is an order doctor marr do you hear me
its for you renny i did it for you
mister worf take charge of the doctor mister data shut down the transmission
vibration amplitude is increasing it cant last much longer
i cannot stop our graviton signal captain doctor marr has isolated the access code
maybe i can create an override sequence shut it down from here
the amplitude is still rising captain resonance is approaching critical
i can override her programme but its going to take some time

mister worf will you escort the doctor to her quarters
yes sir
it will never hurt anyone again
perhaps i should escort the doctor sir
fine but dont leave her unattended
please come with me doctor
of course

i will stay with you doctor
how long will you live data
there has been no predetermined limit placed on my existence doctor
im glad as long as youre alive hell be alive i need your help data
in what way doctor
like you did before tell me that you understand renny that you know i did it for you because i love you because i wanted to give you peace at last
i do not find such a file in your sons journals however from what i know of him by his memories and his writing i do not believe he would be happy he was proud of your career as a scientist and now you have destroyed that you say you did it for him but i do not believe he would have wanted that yes i believe your son would be very sad now i am sorry doctor but i cannot help you
disaster

captains log stardate  our mission to mudor five has been completed and since our next assignment will not begin for several days we are enjoying a welcome respite from our duties


if its a boy michael after my father
wait a minute we decided on hiro after my father
we talked about this last night
thats right and we decided on hiro
wait ive got it william its a great name william obrien its got a nice ring to it
its all right hes just doing somersaults here feel

right there
hes going to be a hell of a gymnast
may i
sure there feel it when hes not turning hes kicking and punching when i want to sleep he wants to wake up at this point i just wish it were over
i have to go ive got a transporter simulation on the bridge byebye michael

no
come on geordi
no
just try it once it is not as hard as you think im telling you you will be terrific
all right  i am the very model of a modern major general ive information vegetable animal and mineral i cant do this
yes you can
i cannot sing in front of people
you were terrific you were a little off pitch but i think i can take care of that okay la forge as a modern major general

captain id like to introduce you to the winners of the primary school science fair this is marissa jay gordon and patterson theyre here for their tour
hello
can we see the battle bridge and torpedo bay
no im afraid not but we will be visiting the hydroponics and astrophysics laboratories
im sure youll have a wonderful time
well if youll come with me

im not sure who to feel sorry for the captain or the kids

i want you to know were very proud of the science fair winners perhaps some of you will choose to pursue a career in starfleet well then what did you do for your science projects
i planted radishes in this special dirt and they came up all weird
i see thats very very commendable and you
an analysis of the life span of the swarming moths of gonal four they only live for twenty hours then they all die
how interesting and you

were falling


 what happened
 sensors are picking up subspace distortions and high energy particles directly to starboard
looks like we ran into a quantum filament damage report
weve lost primary life support switching to secondary systems impulse and warp engines are offline
theres another filament moving toward us sir
all decks brace for impact

counsellor
im all right medical team to the bridge troi to sickbay counsellor troi to captain picard troi to engineering counsellor troi to any crew member please acknowledge

medical team to the bridge
the computers down it looks like we still have impulse power but not much else
lieutenant monroe

chief obrien the turbolifts arent working were trapped up here


are you are you children all right

bridge this is picard this is the captain can anyone hear me
why dont they answer
i dont know
theyre all dead
theyre not dead communication is down thats all
were going to die too
we most certainly are not now listen to me no one here is going to die the bridge will be sending a rescue party as soon as possible so i want you all to stop crying everything is going to be all right


this is the federation starship enterprise calling any vessel within range we are in distress and need assistance please respond im still not sure were even transmitting ill set the message on auto repeat and see if we get a response

are you all right
im alive what the hell happened
we were hit by a quantum filament most of our systems are down and we havent been able to contact anyone off the bridge
well dont count on leaving through there an emergency bulkhead closed just beneath that lift
confinement mode
right isolation protocol
im not really familiar with that protocol
if the computer senses a hull breach it automatically closes emergency bulkheads to isolate the breach until we can clear those bulkheads well be cut off from the rest of the ship
i have partial sensors back online im picking up sporadic life signs throughout the saucer section there are definitely survivors
what about ten forward
ten forward
my wifes there
im sorry chief the readings are not that specific
can you scan the drive section
im not reading any life signs in the drive section
could the sensors be malfunctioning
theres no way to know without the main computer i cant run a full diagnostic
can you sense anything counsellor
there are a lot of people still alive many of them are hurt but i cant tell where they are
we need to start emergency procedures whos the duty officer
lieutenant monroe was in command but shes dead i believe counsellor troi is the senior officer on the deck
counsellor troi
she carries the rank of lieutenant commander
id appreciate some suggestions
i recommend we initiate emergency procedure alpha two bypass computer control and place all systems on manual override
very well
aye aye sir
may i suggest that our next priority be to stabilise life support and try to reestablish intership communications
yes mister mandel id like you to assist ensign ro
yes sir


how do you feel
okay a little foggy
just lie still for a while well get you to sickbay as soon as we can
okay
report
i have surveyed all the turbolifts and service crawlways on this deck access to the bridge has been completely severed by emergency bulkheads
sickbay
heavy damage to section twenty three a has cut off access to sickbay i have ordered a security team to bring casualties here until further notice
i think we should assume the worst that everyone on the bridge is dead theres no one is in control of the ship
in that circumstance reestablishing control should be our top priority
agreed can we get to engineering
yes sir the most direct route is blocked but i believe we can use a starboard service crawlway
okay you and i will try to get there mister worf this room is going to fill with wounded in a few minutes and theyre going to need help i want you to stay in charge here
yes sir
lets go

over here
yes sir


okay clear the power shunt
the shunt is cleared
right and bypass the flow current and  the computer still wont release the doors
can we force them open
yes we can try theres an emergency hand actuator
geordi
yes
this wall is hot
where

im all right but i think weve got a new problem one of the energy conduits mustve ruptured and ignited the polyduranide inside the bulkhead thats a plasma fire

its putting out a lot of radiation we cant stay in here very long
weve got a bigger problem than that the quaratum in these containers is used in emergency thruster packs its normally pretty stable stuff but when you expose quaratum to radiation it has a way of exploding


the external power is cut off
were going to die

what was that
i dont know

your name is marissa is that right well marissa im going to need a first officer to help me youre the oldest and so that makes you my number one
number one
thats what i always called my first officer so here

there now number one we need a crew to help us get that hatch off dont you think that jay here would make an excellent science officer what do you say jay will you join our crew
its jay gordon
of course forgive me jay gordon
i accept

there
can i be an officer too
well let me see your science project involved radishes did it not
yes sir
then i shall appoint you my executive officer in charge of radishes

there right then lets get to work

thirteen sixty five baker that should put us right behind shuttlebay two
that is correct sir we have approximately fifty two metres remaining in this crawlway before we can safely exit into a main corridor

coolant leak


we can withstand this level of radiation for another three or four hours without any permanent damage well need a few days of hyronalin treatments
what are the radiation levels in the quaratum
theyre at eighty three rads and rising at a rate of about four rads per minute
that stuff gets unstable at around three hundred and fifty rads i still havent been able to get any power to this transporter
the radiation levels is about twenty percent lower at this end of the bay lets move the containers over to here
thats a good idea it should buy us some time you know were going to have to do this by hand with all the radiation floating around in here we cant trust the antigrav units


there just before the second time we were hit see the subspace distortion
yes how big is a quantum filament
it can be hundreds of metres long but it has almost no mass which makes it very difficult to detect
so its like a cosmic string
no thats a completely different phenomenon

how did you do that
i diverted power from the phaser array and i dumped it into the engineering control system
you what
engineering stations online counsellor
but thats a completely improper procedure you cant just dump that much raw energy into a bridge terminal without blowing
were not going to get out of this by playing it safe
what is our engine status ensign
weve got half impulse power available but im getting some odd readings from the warp drive im reading a spike in the warp field array it looks like a containment deviation
switch to primary bypass
nothing field strengths at forty percent and falling weve got a problem the quantum resonance of the filament caused a polarity shift in the antimatter containment field
when the filament hit us the ship was momentarily charged as if it had come into contact with a live electrical wire
that weakened the containment field surrounding the antimatter pods the field strength is at forty percent and it is still falling
if it falls to fifteen percent the field will collapse and well have a containment breach
which means
which means the ship will explode

commander the current cannot be off down from this relay box
we cant just sit here
if the energy flowing through that arc were interrupted by a nonconductive material it is likely the circuit would be broken
i dont see any material in here that could handle that much current
commander much of my bodyframe is made up of tripolymers a non conductive material
are you suggesting we use your own body
yes sir
data theres half a million amps flowing through that arc could your body handle that much current
the power surge would cause a system failure in my internal processors and melt my primary power couplings however there is a chance that the damage would not be irreparable
no
commander our options are very limited
first of all android or not i wouldnt ask anyone to take that kind of risk second if the computer is not working in engineering im going to need your help to get control of the ship
my positronic brain has several layers of shielding to protect me from power surges it would be possible for you to remove my cranial unit and take it with you
let me get this straight you want me to take off your head
yes sir is something wrong sir
well data would you be all right
my memory core and neural nets are selfcontained i would be fine sir
well like you said our choices are very limited

data data data
a remarkable experience commander
are you all right did the shielding work
apparently so sir my neural nets are still fully operational you may begin by opening the ventral access panel located two centimetres beneath my right ear


can you climb up
yes i think so
good now look down the sides of the lift can you see two big clamps
yes i see them
can you see if those clamps are attached to long beams inside big grooves
yes but one of them looks broken its half out of the groove
all right come down

all right number one those big clamps are part of the emergency system if something goes wrong theyre designed to hold the turbolift in place but it would seem that theyre damaged
is that why we keep shaking
thats right now when they give way we shall fall so youve got to get your crew out of here before that happens now there is a ladder along the wall of the shaft you can climb up that until you come to an open doorway
what about you
my ankle is broken i will just slow you down when you need to move quickly now you are the leader and thats an order
we have to climb up the shaft
i want to stay here with you captain
patterson youre an officer you have to obey orders
i dont want to be an officer any more i want to stay here with you
if the captain stays here we wont make it well all die
we dont have time to argue you must go now
the crew has decided to stick together we all go or we all stay
all right ill try but i want you to know this is mutiny now number one look at that control panel now the yellow control pad hit that once now the one below it hit twice now that should release the panel underneath
yes it did
now you can pull it away
okay
good now that bundle of wires thats optical cabling see how much of that you can pull out


the levels are still rising there must be some way to put that fire out
the energys being fed by the ships internal power grid and we cant even get near that the only way to stop it would be to eliminate its supply of oxygen wait a minute doctor ive got an idea its kind or wild but we just might be able to kill two birds with one stone
lets hear it
okay we open the external door that would depressurise the cargo bay and suck all of those containers out into space at the same time the lack of oxygen should put out the plasma fire
what about us
we just need to find something in here to hold onto while the air is evacuating then we close the door repressurise the bay
what about this

yeah that ought to do it


there that should do it
 there will be a sharp pain as i set the bone prepare yourself good good you bore that well

keiko
im all right i think
perhaps you should lie down
oh oh oh im having contractions
i believe that is not uncommon in the late months of pregnancy
no i mean contractions im going into labour
you cannot this this is not a good time keiko
its not open for debate like it or not this baby is coming


if the containment field strength continues to drop at its present rate we still have at least two hours before it becomes critical
but youre ignoring the fact that the power coupling is also damaged if that coupling overheats the field strength could drop a lot faster we could have a containment breach in a matter of minutes
what do you suggest
we should separate the saucer now and put as much distance as possible between us and the drive section
excuse me sir but thats damn cold blooded what about the people down there
theres no evidence that anyone is still alive in the drive section
no evidence theyre dead either if you were trapped down there would you like us to just cut you loose and leave
no of course not but i also wouldnt expect the bridge crew to risk the safety of the ship and hundreds of lives in a futile effort to rescue me
you said there was no way to stabilise the containment field from the bridge could it be done from engineering
yes but my readings indicate theres no power down there they dont even have monitors to tell them theres a problem
could we divert energy from the bridge to those monitors
yes sir
ill say it again there is no reason to believe that anyone is alive in engineering were wasting time even talking about this we have to separate the ship now
i believe there are still people alive down there and im going to give them every chance assuming theyre alive theyll be hoping theres someone up here who can help them so well help them chief divert the necessary power to engineering
aye sir
i remind you counsellor that power coupling could overheat at any moment by not separating the ship now you may be responsible for all our deaths
thank you ensign proceed


i cant open this door were going to have to climb up to the next deck
what if that one doesnt open either
then well never get out
quiet both of you thats an order
were going up ready
ready sir

the lifts falling hang on
were all right were going to keep on climbing just dont look down
whats wrong
hes scared
were right with you patterson youre not going to fall everything will be all right if you just keep climbing what we need is a climbing song marissa is there a song you sing at school
the laughing vulcan and his dog
im afraid i dont know that one i know frere jacques thats a song i used to sing when i was at school patterson do you know that one good it goes like this frere jacques frere jacques dormez vous dormez vous
sonnez les matines sonnez les matines ding ding dong ding ding dong
very good now keep singing
frere jacques frere jacques dormez vous dormez vous sonnez les matines sonnez les matines ding ding dong ding ding dong frere jacques frere jacques dormez vous dormez vous sonnez les matines sonnez les matines ding ding dong ding ding dong frere jacques frere jacques

your contractions are now only thirty seconds apart dilation has gone to seven centimetres since the onset of labour that did not take long
thats easy for you to say
you are doing very well i am sure the child will arrive soon
worf has the baby turned
turned
so the head is down doctor crusher told me a few days ago that it hadnt she wasnt worried because i still had a month to go
i am not certain cant you tell
worf have you ever done this before delivered a baby
yes no i have taken the starfleet emergency medical course in a computerised simulation i assisted in the delivery of a human baby
sometimes it doesnt go by the book worf
i am sure everything will be fine

once the air is vented the first thing youll feel is extreme pressure in your lungs you have to resist the temptation to exhale next our hands and feet will get cold then numb and some of the capillaries on exposed sections of the skin may burst
sounds like fun
we will have about fifteen seconds of useful consciousness then about ten seconds of extreme disorientation then we pass out
okay once the air is evacuated one of us is going to need to get to that panel to repressurise the bay

were ready are you okay


the field strength is down to twenty percent we cannot run the risk of staying here any longer
were in no danger until it drops below fifteen percent we can afford to wait and see if anyone in engineering notices those monitors
have you made preparations to separate the saucer section
yes sir were in stand by mode for docking latches
ensign theres a thermal inversion in the power coupling
quick crossconnect to the transfer coil that was close
what happened
exactly what i said might happen the power coupling overheated and the entire containment field almost collapsed obriens fixed it temporarily but this could happen again at any moment and next time we might not be able to stop it you cant let wishful thinking guide your decision counsellor its time to leave
we will separate the ship when i decide that its time and not before is that clear ensign
yes perfectly


okay try it
very good commander you have established a connection i can now raise the door

theres no power on this entire deck yet somehow these monitors are working
the power reaching those monitors has been diverted from the bridge sir
but why unless theres something they want us  something they need us to see wait a minute data the containment field strength is down to eighteen percent can you stabilise it
no sir i do not have access to the containment field you will have to establish a new link locate the odn conduit sir

got it
yes sir you must now change the input matrix in my secondary optical port and then connect the odn conduit

that is not the correct port sir
sorry
you must hurry commander the containment field has dropped to sixteen percent
im trying you need a bigger head
the field continues to drop sir collapse is imminent
try it now
i have a connection sir i am now stabilising the containment field

sir the field strength is stabilising eighteen percent twenty twenty five
i guess they got our message i was wrong counsellor
you could have easily been right



congratulations you are fully dilated to ten centimetres you may now give birth
thats what ive been doing
bearing down is the next stage it should start at full dilation why has it not begun
i dont know i dont think its up to me it happens when it happens
the computer simulation was not like this that delivery was very orderly
well im sorry
did you feel an uncontrollable urge to push

good you are bearing down now you must push with each contraction and i must urge you gently but firmly to push harder push keiko push hard push keiko push push
i am pushing
the baby is emerging head first one more contraction
okay
thats good push push hard i have the baby i will smack the child to induce breathing

now i will cut the umbilical cord blanket i believe she looks like chief obrien

hello you were wonderful worf i couldnt have done it without you hello
captains log supplemental we are en route to starbase sixty seven to undergo repairs life aboard the enterprise is slowly returning to normal


now just wait here
you just cant stay away from the big chair can you
i dont think im cut out to be captain first officer maybe i understand there arent many qualifications
captain picard to the bridge please

hello its good to see you again what brings you to the bridge
in appreciation for the way you helped us get out of the turboshaft and the way you helped us not be scared we want to present to you this commemorative plaque give it to him

thank you thank you very much
i made the back piece
and a wonderful job you did of it too well later this afternoon were going to finish the tour i promised you starting with the battle bridge ill see you at fourteen hundred hours you have the bridge number one
aye sir
the game



etana i know youre back there dont make me come after you

give me that
you dont need that
yes i do

i need that communicator
commander riker to the enterprise ive a terrible problem down here on risa
give me that

go get it
i dont believe you did that
believe it

what is this
its a game everyone heres playing it its fun
do i keep my eyes open or closed
open

what am i seeing
the playing field

now what
see the disc and the cone
yeah
concentrate make the disc go into the cone
how do i do that
just let go relax youll do it

what was that
your reward for clearing the first level
how far does this game go
as far as you can take it would you like to go for level two

captains log stardate  commander riker has rejoined the enterprise from risa and we are on our way to an uncharted area called the phoenix cluster were all anticipating this historic first look at the region

its starting to get busy around here five new science teams just beamed in from the zhukov quarters are filling up fast
on top of everything theres been a change weve been given only two weeks to complete the exploration
two weeks thats not enough time to explore a region that size i thought we had five weeks
commander starfleet has added a diplomatic mission to oceanus four
will im leaving it up to you to make sure that all science departments have an equal chance of completing their research
thatll be quite a juggling act
oh and one piece of good news were to rendezvous with a shuttlecraft carrying wesley crusher hes on vacation from the academy
wesley good well need an extra hand around here

geordi how are you coming with the survey preparations
im up to my neck in observation schedules right now our biggest hurdle is sensor availability
especially since two new exobiologists and three stellar cartographers have joined us from the zhukov
fifteen science teams only two weeks and one longrange array dont make for a great combination
what about the lateral sensors
theyre booked solid for planetary observation
and the gamma ray scanner
were reprogramming them now lefler a moment of your time please

you know robin lefler
of course
her work around heres been so sensational ive decided to make her a mission specialist
congratulations
thank you sir
okay specialist whats our sensor status
were increasing the available bandwidth so more science teams can use the sensors at once we figured out a way to do it by multiplexing the array
can we have that done before we arrive
yes sir you can count on it
keep it up lefler

geordi i brought something back from risa that you have got to try it
id love to but im running a full sensor recalibration in ten minutes can it wait
of course ill catch up with you later


chocolate ice cream chocolate fudge and chocolate chips youre not depressed are you
im fine commander
would you like me to leave you two alone
no you can join us

no thanks i dont like fudge
really i never met a chocolate i didnt like
doesnt it taste good
of course it does but its not just a matter of taste its the whole experience first of all you have to spoon the fudge around the rim leaving only ice cream in the middle then you gently spoon the ice cream around the sides like youre sculpting it relish every bite make every one an event and then with the last spoonful close your eyes
i had no idea it was such a ritual
chocolate is a serious thing
i brought something back from risa better than chocolate
oh what is it
just a game

chief obrien
welcome back wesley
congratulations on little molly
thanks you wait till you see her shes the spitting image of her dad
so where is everybody is my mom around
the senior staff is in a meeting youre supposed to go to your mothers quarters
oh do you think itd be all right if i dropped in just to say hi
ill check chief obrien to bridge
bridge here
wesley crusher has arrived and wants to know if he can stop by the observation lounge to say hi
i suppose that is acceptable
thanks


surprise
mom
welcome home
hi mom
wesley
captain
quomodo tua latinitas est
praestat quam prius
oppido bonum your latin has improved
youre looking very handsome
you really do that cadet uniform justice wesley
i bet youre driving all the girls wild
wesley tarvokian pound cake i made it myself
thanks worf
wesley was our attempt to make you uncomfortable effective
you bet it was for a second there i thought i was on the wrong ship
did you find our deception pleasing
yeah its fun to be surprised
are you here to work or to play mister crusher
sir
i know youre on vacation probably like to sleep and spend some time on the holodeck but if youre so inclined we could use your help with the phoenix cluster survey
sounds great sir
excellent as soon as you get settled come down to engineering and well get you started
so what kind of game is this
come by my quarters and ill show it to you

have you found the academy challenging wesley
yeah i thought after being on the enterprise it would be a breeze but theres a lot more to learn than just starship operations what was your first year like
although i did extremely well scholastically my lack of human understanding often created social obstacles
like what
i particularly remember the phenomenon of practical jokes several of which i fell victim to
tell me about it my first week that i was there this guy named adam martoni reprogrammed the sonic shower to cover me with mud it took me a while but i got him back really good
good for you
thanks
i also found social gatherings difficult there was one event an academy tradition the sadie hawkins dance
they still hold it every year
a notably awkward experience
i know what you mean i cant even dance
really your mother is quite an expert she recently taught me
the dancing doctor she tried to teach me too but i just dont have the knack
i would be happy to teach you dancing i have programmed a comprehensive seventeen part course with some interesting holographic partners
ill let you know

ill modify the planetary scanners
just make sure we keep enough data lines open for stellar physics
no problem ill compress the signal flow
all right

why arent these registering
you might try calibrating them manually
excuse me
the detectors they tend to get temperamental you can try calibrating them by hand
youre kidding the computer has to do this
no look the subroutine lets you do it from the panel law seventeen when all else fails do it yourself
its working thanks
sure
by the way im wesley wesley crusher
i know just came back from the academy
thats right
robin lefler
hi
hi
your neutrinos are drifting

theyre what

geordi a conflict has started between the planetary evolution team and the stellar physicists each wishes to be the first to use the thermal imaging array
well tell them to flip a coin weve got to work together on this mission otherwise were never going to get it done
a coin very good i will replicate one immediately
doctor crusher to data
data here
do you have a minute to join me in sickbay i need your help with something
yes doctor on my way

you wanted to see me doctor
yes data i need to ask you to do something for me im working on a new experiment with bioactive silicon would you reprogram this tricorder to these specifications
certainly
im sorry to bother you with it but i need it done quickly
it does not bother me in fact i am happy to

computer secure sickbay
all entries to sickbay are secured



lets see i have novakovich for anthropology and horne for creative writing
walter horne is he still teaching
yeah he is and hes good too and youll be pleased to know i took your advice the first week that i was there i went and met boothby
how is old boothby i hope he didnt tell you a lot of stories about me
he didnt remember you sir at first i found an old yearbook photo and he remembered you right away he said hes very proud of you that youre captain of the enterprise
is he still tending grounds or have the years finally caught up with him
not that i can tell he took me on a grand tour of the place he showed me every single blade of grass practically
i had the very same tour
sir what do the initials a f stand for
af
boothby said he caught you carving those initials into his prized elm tree
af just an acquaintance of mine  wesley if you meet someone whose initials you might want to carve into that elm tree dont let it interfere with your studies i failed organic chemistry because of af
crusher to captain picard
go ahead doctor
i need you in sickbay immediately
on my way

he came in complaining of a servo malfunction but my scans came out negative then he just collapsed
what have you found
his biosystems and positronic functions seem to check out and his power cells are active
from what i can tell his higher functions are intact but the signals arent getting from his brain to the rest of his body its like hes in a coma
data performs self diagnostic routines on a regular basis we should take a look at his logs they may reveal something
i recommend going through his quarters as well you never know what we might find
agreed continue the analysis keep me informed

standard security sweep shows nothing out of the ordinary
personal logs diagnostics duty logs they all appear normal theres no evidence of anything that could lead to datas shutdown
maybe we should ask his cat
i guess id better get back to sickbay see if theres any change in his condition
doctor crushers got everything under control geordi if theres any change youll be the first to know
i guess so
looks to me like you need a break unwind a little
yeah maybe youre right
ive got just the thing why dont you join me in ten forward theres something id like you to try

conduits twelve and twenty two are still down for testing
we can reroute through junction fourteen b
you have a funny way of looking at conduit configuration but it works
thats law thirty six youve got to go with what works
what are all these laws that i keep hearing about
theyre my personal laws every time i learn something essential i make up a law about it so i never forget
how many do you have
a hundred and two so far

looks like the starboard array needs another subprocessor
itll be online in a few minutes im way ahead of you
they said you were good
why do i get the feeling that you already know me
i have a few friends at the academy your names come up a couple of times that was really some stung you pulled on adam martoni in the physics lab i just want to know how you got the antimatter regulator to spray chili sauce
there is another side to that story
is it true what they say about your birthmark
this isnt fair i hardly know anything about you
hey thats law forty six life isnt
always fair yeah i know that law i still have to work on the sensor relays but id like a chance to even the score ten forward nineteen hundred hours will you join me for coffee
no but ill meet you for dinner
captains log supplemental we have arrived at the phoenix cluster but it will take us several hours to determine the best possible location from which to conduct our survey commander datas condition remains unchanged with no further indication as to the cause of his collapse


mom
wesley
what are you doing
im embarrassed to say this was meant for you but it was so much fun i couldnt resist
what is it
its a game riker brought it back from risa everybodys playing it want to try
maybe later hows data
geordis still working on him hes going to be fine
i think i should go give him a hand
no wesley you are on vacation you have done enough already
yeah maybe youre right computer increase light level
are you in a hurry
yeah im late for a dinner date
really with who
robin lefler from engineering
why dont you invite her here we can all play the game together i can replicate a couple more
mom
sorry its just that i want to spend some time together while youre here
well have time together i promise
okay
okay
just one game come on try it on for size
mom i really need to get ready
have a good time
thanks i will

when your parents are the only plasma specialists in the sector you do a lot of travelling around we went from base to base to base i felt like a piece of luggage after a while i spent all of my time around technical gear my first friend was a tricorder
really my very first friend was a warp coil
my parents work came first they didnt really have time for me even when i needed them so thats how i learned my first law law one you can only count on yourself
sounds kind of lonely well now youre here
now im here
well im glad
you wouldnt believe whats going on in engineering commander la forge and all the others theyre crazy about some new game
yeah what kind of game is it
its some risian gadget that fits over your ear
have you played it
not yet
my mom has one she keeps trying to get me to play it
its everywhere

see what i mean
dont you think thats a little strange everybody playing it all the time
its just a fad its here this week next week we wont even know it existed
i wonder how it works
why dont you try it and find out
id like to know a little bit more about it before i try it
i bet if we worked together we could figure it out
yeah we could hook it up to one of the computers the medical programs in the lab can be set up to emulate human responses
i noticed it uses a visual interface we could connect it through an optical sensor

ive loaded the neurological behaviour programme this sensor pad should allow the computer to process whatever information the game sends at it
lets see what happens
okay
its activating the reticular formation
theres heavy synaptic activity all over the place
i wonder what happens after prolonged exposure
speed up the processor and well find out
the effect seems centred around the frontal lobe
computer enhance frontal lobe full spectrum
its stimulating the septal area
thats the pleasure centre of the brain whatever this thing does it must feel pretty good
no wonder its so popular
look at this serotonin levels are way off lets run a neurochemical analysis
im seeing widespread bonding to neuroreceptors
correct me if im wrong but this looks like a psychotropic reaction
are you saying you think the games addictive
whats going on in the prefrontal cortex
doesnt that area control higher reasoning
yeah it sure does id better go talk to the captain

come
sorry to bother you sir
its no bother wesley please sit down
thanks
how are the survey preparations coming along
theyre coming along fine but thats not what im here to talk to you about
what then
theres a game going around its something that commander riker brought back from risa its a device that hooks around the ears
yes ive seen it
i did some preliminary tests on the game and what i found leads me to believe that it may have some harmful sideeffects specifically sir i think its psychotropically addictive
addictive what have you discovered
the game initiates a serotonin cascade in the frontal lobe of the brain now i know thats nothing conclusive but it could explain why everyone is so attracted to it and at the same time it stimulates the brains reasoning centre i dont know what thats all about
ill start an investigation immediately thank you mister crusher
thank you sir
wesley its good to have you back again


have you tried this
ive tried it thanks its great
robin
where have you been everyones after me to try it
i know i got stopped in the corridor twice i talked to the captain hes going to look into it
i hope he makes a shipwide announcement or something because this thing is really starting to give me the creeps
did you forget your games
we left them in our quarters
well then use mine
no thanks
try it
she said no thanks

you know what else is really weird if this game is so addictive theres only one person onboard we can be sure wouldnt be affected by it
data
right and he managed to get injured right when the game was brought on board wed better take a look at him

maybe you should go check again
the nurse is still playing the game
i dont know what to make of this theres brain activity all his systems seem to be working
how can that be hes unconscious
maybe theres a signal breach between his brain and his body lets map his nervous system and see if we can isolate a weak link patch the neural output through to that station here the signal stops just below his cortex processor theres some kind of damage its almost undetectable lets look at it on the viewer
wesley look at that
it looks like some of his positronic links have been severed
the cuts are precise look how clean the edges are computer increase magnification factor four
only two people on board know enough about data to do something like this commander la forge and my mother
why would one of them do this to him
maybe theres more going on here than we thought what if someones trying to use the game for some purpose other than pleasure
then data would be a threat to that plan and only with data out of the way would everybody become addicted
and everyone has except us

weve reached the designated coordinates captain there is a ship bearing three two seven mark one five two on an intercept course
advise them of our status mister worf go replicate what you need and see that the devices are properly distributed not forgetting mister crusher


wesley wesley
in here mom

it worked
we should keep these mockups with us we cant trust anyone anymore not even the captain
im supposed to be on duty in engineering ive got to get back before commander la forge suspects something
okay when you get there start accessing the codes for the security tracking system theres something i want to try
wesley dont forget law ninety one always watch your back
you too

the vessel is approaching captain
computer all senior officers report to the bridge on screen
report
welcome etana the enterprise has been secured we await your further instructions
the expansion will proceed as follows commander riker you will pilot a shuttlecraft to the cleon system where you will rendezvous with the starship endeavour proceed with distributing the device to that vessel commander la forge counsellor troi take a shuttle to starbase sixty seven distribute the device to all starships currently docked there
we also have an opportunity to introduce the game to starfleet academy
excellent see to it the ktarians commend your efforts picard once the expansion is complete you and your crew will be rewarded


deck thirty six
wesley at what level are you
im only level ten
im at level forty seven
thats great
you know what the secret is dont you dont force it if you just let the game happen it almost plays itself
ill try that

i think were going to be okay ive just got one more thing to do help me compile the forcefield overrides
what are you doing
i created a site to site transporter programme if things get difficult thisll keep us one step ahead of them were able to access the security tracking codes robin
its your turn wesley play the game

get back here

computer activate security containment field deck thirty six section fifty two

computer transport programme crusher one



riker to bridge we lost crusher it appears he rigged a sitetosite transport
security alert condition three computer shut down all transporter systems and shuttlebays mister la forge
i cant track him sir hes done something to the internal security sensors ill try bypassing his subcommands hold on im picking up a piece of his trail sir sensors show power activation in transporter room three that would put him somewhere on deck six
seal off deck six activate security fields sections twenty three through twenty nine
aye sir



weve got him captain section twenty five it looks like hes trying to cut through the forcefield with a phaser
security to deck six section twenty five
on our way


you check left


where the hell is he
i am attempting to isolate him with thermal sensors
narrow the scan field go deck by deck if you have to
unfortunately he knows our procedures he will avoid corridors and public areas commander an unidentified heat source deck seven section twenty three there


no let go of me


its okay wesley
you led us quite a chase mister crusher doctor crusher
no
hold him steady
its okay wesley it wont hurt
 no
youll like it
his eyes

thats right wesley just let it go yes just let yourself go relax

computer resume normal illumination

mister worf you will find a small alien ship off the starboard bow please secure it with a tractor beam and raise our shields
engaging tractor beam
are you all right captain
i think so mister data
captain we are being hailed by the alien vessel
on screen
explain yourself picard
the explanation is simple your attempt to capture our ship has failed
release us immediately or we will open fire
tactical analysis mister worf
their weapons systems are substantially inferior to ours they are not a threat
get her off the screen
i cant believe what we were about to do
data we deactivated you
i managed to reconnect his positronic matrix
wesleys subsequent diversions gave me adequate time to modify the palm beacon the optical burst patterns we programmed were successful in counteracting the addictive effects of the game
and the rest of the crew
we programmed the main computer to transmit the same optical burst to all display screens work stations and terminals throughout the ship
that should reach almost everyone take a medical team to treat the rest
aye sir
well take the alien ship to the nearest federation starbase ensign lay in a course
captains log stardate  we have delivered the ktarian vessel to starbase eighty two and are now on a course to rendezvous with the starship merrimack which will transport wesley crusher back to starfleet academy

i never saw you wear these afraid someone might see your birthmark
now i wonder who started that birthmark rumour

i wish you didnt have to go
me too
youll write wont you
somebody has to kill all those rumours you keep hearing about me
mister crusher weve rendezvoused with the merrimack please report to transporter room two
on my way sir ive got to go
here a gift so youll remember robins laws all one hundred and two of them
thanks law one hundred and three
yes
a couple of light years cant keep good friends apart bye
unification part 


last time on star trek the next generation
three weeks ago one of our most celebrated ambassadors an advisor to federation leaders for generations disappeared
i gave spock the benefit of experience of logic he never listened
its been suggested that spock might have defected
why would anyone want a vulcan shield array
beats me commander every question we answer here seems to bring up two more
be careful android some romulan beauty might take a liking to you lick that paint right off your ears you do you know what the romulans will do to you if they discover who you are
i have a good idea
sir the ship is locking phasers
shields up red alert
what do you know of this human jeanluc picard a starfleet captain
youve made a mistake
quiet come with us
i have come on an urgent mission from the federation im looking for ambassador spock
you have found him captain picard
and now the conclusion

what are you doing on romulus
that was to have been my question of you sir
it is no concern of starfleet
on the contrary it is very much starfleets concern youre in a position to compromise the security of the federation
you may assure your superiors captain that i am here on a personal mission of peace and i will advise starfleet when it is appropriate
that is not satisfactory
you cannot remain here captain picard
and i will not return without a full explanation ambassador with great respect for all that youve achieved on behalf of the federation this sort of cowboy diplomacy will not easily be tolerated any more
cowboy diplomacy
if you wish to undertake a mission with obvious repercussions to the federation then you should discuss it with the federation im here as their representative youll have to discuss it with me
that is precisely what i had hoped to avoid
i also have the responsibility of being the bearer of unhappy news
sarek sarek is dead walk with me picard


i know of your mindmeld with my father which enabled him to complete his last mission
it was an honour he is a great man
he was a great representative of the vulcan people and of the federation
i was with him before coming here he expressed his pride in you his love
emotional disarray was a symptom of the illness from which he suffered
no those feelings came from his heart spock he shared them with me i know
sarek would no more approve my coming here than you do picard for some time now ive been aware of a growing movement here of people who seek to learn the ideals of the vulcan philosophy theyve been declared enemies of the state but there are a few in the romulan hierarchy like pardek who are sympathetic he asked me to come now because he believes it may be time to take the first step toward reunification
reunification after so many centuries after so many fundamental differences have evolved between your peoples
it would seem unlikely to succeed but i cannot ignore the potential rewards that a union between our two worlds would bring
what is this first step that pardek suggests
there is a new proconsul in the romulan senate he is young and idealistic he has promised many reforms pardek believes that he may be receptive to discussing reunification
why would you not bring something so important to the attention of your own people or the federation
a personal decision captain perhaps you are aware of the small role i played in the overture to peace with the klingons
history is aware of the role you played ambassador
not entirely it was i who committed captain kirk to that peace mission and i who had to bear the responsibility for the consequences to him and his crew quite simply i am unwilling to risk anyones life but my own on this occasion so i ask you respect my wishes and leave
ambassador your logic escapes me if i didnt know better i would say that your judgment is influenced by your emotions
you speak as my father would if he were here picard
i speak as a starfleet officer and i cannot ignore the risks to you
i was involved with cowboy diplomacy as you describe it long before you were born
nevertheless sir im not prepared to leave until your affairs are completed
in your own way you are as stubborn as another captain of the enterprise i once knew
then im in good company sir

we have more important things to attend to than acting as your nursemaids
captain picard regrets detaining you but it will be necessary for a while longer in addition i require access to your ships computer
access to our computer for what purpose
i am going to attempt to penetrate the romulan central information net
dont bother weve been trying for years
i have unique skills that may allow me to succeed
i cannot reveal classified klingon entry codes to starfleet
your entry codes can be easily reconfigured after we depart and captain picard has authorised me to share with you any information we obtain from the romulan databanks
anything else
we will also need to communicate with the enterprise in sector two thirteen
you do and the romulans will instantly know our coordinates
using conventional means that would be true however i suggest we piggyback our signal on romulan subspace transmissions
piggyback
a human metaphor pardon me we would use a romulan signal as a carrier for own one thus disguising its origin
it wont work
i believe it would during the last hour i have conducted a systematic review of the entire romulan subspace grid i have compared my findings with the specifications of your own transmission array they appear to be compatible

thank you for your cooperation




allow me to brighten your table jolan tru
the senate has adjourned pardek will be here shortly
how widespread is this movement
there are groups in every populated area ive personally spoken with members from four provinces it has become a serious concern for the romulan leadership
serious enough for the leaders to suddenly embrace a vulcan peace initiative i have some difficulty in accepting that
i sense you have a closed mind captain closed minds have kept these two worlds apart for centuries in the federation we have learned from experience to view the romulans with distrust we can either choose to live with that enmity or seek an opportunity to change it i choose the latter
i will be the first to cheer when the neutral zone is abolished but i wonder if this movement is strong enough to reshape the entire romulan political landscape
one can begin to reshape the landscape with a single flower captain
jolan tru mister spock here look what ive brought you

this is my friend dtan hes very curious about vulcan
hello dtan
where did you get this this is very old
they read to us from it at the meetings it tells the story of the vulcan separation
dtan you should not bring that out here youve been told many times
i just wanted to show it to mister spock
off with you well see you later tonight
will you tell us more stories about vulcan
yes i will
jolan tru
perhaps this is not such a good place to talk

so what do you think of your enemy captain picard
these people are no ones enemy senator
many of my colleagues fear what they have to say but i have learned to listen carefully children like dtan are our future old men like me will not be able to hold on to ancient prejudice and hostility young people wont allow it but now now that theyve met their first real vulcan it has only inspired them more i am sure that is evident to you spock
i did not anticipate such a passionate response to my arrival
romulans are passionate people the vulcans will learn to appreciate that quality in us
if we are successful
we will know soon the proconsul has agreed to meet with you
first officers log stardate  the enterprise remains at qualor two as we continue to investigate the theft of a surplus vulcan ship the trail has led us to the former wife of a deceased smuggler


a new face
same one ive always had
and what would you like to hear
know some blues
look at me mister what do you think seven different shades of them how about some andorian blues suck salt
never cared for it
good for you nasty habit so who are you looking for
who says im looking for anybody
your face your uniform in a place like this
okay im looking for you
oh you just made my day
i have to ask you about your husband
well it was nice while it lasted which husband
the dead one im afraid
oh you must be from the enterprise you destroyed his ship
he was into some bad business he took the evidence with him
his one endearing quality he always cleaned up after himself and what do you want from me
i was hoping you might know his business partners
and why should i help you
to be honest i cant think of a good reason
well you did kill my exhusband and thats not a bad start so why dont you drop a few coins in the jar and ill see what i remember
i dont carry money
well you dont offer much do you
move over
oh just what i need another set of hands
you know this one twentieth century earth maybe i can teach you a lick or two
you already have
so what do you say
you going to be around for a couple of days
i can be
sooner or later a man named omag will come by for a song always wants to hear the same thing melor famagal  hes an arms trader a fat ferengi

enter
proconsul
yes pardek come in
ambassador spock of vulcan
proconsul
please ive never liked titles since i was a lowly uhlan in the romulan guard i am neral how is it again pardeks tried to show me

i am honoured
good
permit me to withdraw
will we see you and your wife tomorrow at the state dinner
were looking forward to it

its been years since old pardeks been invited to an official function hes far too attached to the common man for most peoples comfort
that is their loss i have found pardek to have a unique insight into many issues
let me tell you something spock were going to start something here you and i that will redraw the face of the quadrant
are you prepared to support reunification
i believe it must eventually come our two worlds need each other
forgive me i did not expect to hear a romulan proconsul speak like a member of your underground
i want you to know exactly where i stand
and do you believe that you can gain the support of your full senate
things are not what they once were in the senate the old leaders have lost the respect of the people involvement in the klingon war endless confrontations with the federation theyre tired of it times are changing and leaders who refuse to change with them will no longer be leaders spock i am prepared to publicly endorse the opening of talks between our peoples what do you think the vulcan people think of that
they will be cautious there are generations of distrust to overcome
but surely with a man of your influence leading the way
proconsul the senate has been recalled into session
very well can we meet again tomorrow
as you wish
good jolan tru spock oh live long and prosper

its everything we could have hoped for
it is more than we could have hoped for
but if neral is ready to publicly endorse reunification
its hard to believe that he could rise to the rank of senate proconsul without the support of the romulan traditionalists
that may be true
then how can he turn his back on them so easily how can he endorse reunification when its considered subversive
because hes not afraid of them he knows that well support him
captain picard is correct it is not logical for the proconsul to support reunification at this time
why would neral lie
perhaps because hes hoping to expose members of your movement
no this is our chance for acceptance finally to be heard
i believe its the federation that fears an alliance between romulus and vulcan
that is not true
i came here to determine the potential for reunification in spite of what has occurred i intend to continue with my efforts i intend to meet with the proconsul as planned

you let their emotion sway you
on the contrary i am pursuing the most logical course
you are as sceptical as i am is it logical to ignore your own good sense
i fear the influence of sarek has coloured your attitudes captain toward reunification and perhaps toward me
that is the second time you have accused me of speaking with another mans voice its true he will always be a part of me his experiences his spirit but i speak with my own voice not his
curious that i should hear him so clearly now that he is dead it is possible that i have brought my argument with sarek to you captain if so i apologise
is it so important that you to win one last argument
no it is not but it is true that i will miss the arguments they were finally all that we had
but your fight with sarek is over spock and you have none with me
i always had a different vision than my father the ability to see beyond pure logic he considered it weak but i have discovered it to be a source of extraordinary strength sarek would have seen this mission of reunification as a fools errand but somehow i think it is not logic cannot explain why i know that i must pursue this
even if it leads you into a romulan trap
if the romulans do have an ulterior motive it is in the interests of all concerned that we determine what it is so i will play the role that they would have me play


have you had any success mister data
negative captain the romulan information net employs a progressive encryption lock i have been unable to penetrate their security measures
may i assist you commander i have had some experience in these matters
by all means ambassador
the romulans have incorporated a forty three part cipher key into their entry sequence
yes sir the twenty ninth is the only one i cannot bypass
i think ill take this opportunity to remove my ears

he intrigues me this picard
in what manner sir
remarkably analytical and dispassionate for a human i understand why my father chose to mindmeld with him theres almost a vulcan quality to the man
interesting i have not considered that and captain picard has been a role model in my quest to be more human
more human
yes ambassador
fascinating you have an efficient intellect superior physical skills and no emotional impediments there are vulcans who aspire all their lives to achieve what youve been given by design
you are half human
yes
yet you have chosen a vulcan way of life
i have
in effect you have abandoned what i have sought all my life
i believe i have isolated the twenty ninth cipher access code i shall attempt to access the proconsuls files
ambassador spock may i ask a personal question
please
as you examine your life do you find you have missed your humanity
i have no regrets
no regrets that is a human expression
yes fascinating

do you know any klingon opera
i dont get a lot of requests for it
surely you must know at least one theme from aktuh and maylota
i may be a little rusty

what is that dreadful noise it sounds like a bardakian pronghorn moose you know what i want to hear
yes yes i know
worf to enterprise
go ahead
a fat ferengi

has just entered the establishment
is that melor famagal i hear
it is
im on my way

wheres the waiter is there a waiter in this sorry place
is there a problem
yes i need more napkins
use your sleeve
what did you say
or use one of their sleeves i dont care
who are you
commander william riker uss enterprise
am i supposed to stand up and salute
were investigating the disappearance of a vulcan ship
well youve got the wrong ferengi i never trade in vulcan ships
we know that youre involved
who would want a vulcan ship vulcans are pacifists i deal in warships can somebody get me a napkin
who would want a vulcan ship
hypothetically speaking
hypothetically speaking
i never learned to speak hypothetical

are you crazy
let me explain whatll happen to you if you dont tell me about the vulcan ship your right of passage through this sector will be revoked and more than that i will be very unhappy
i delivered it to a barolian freighter
at what coordinates
i dont remember ow watch it youre stretching my neck
coordinates
at galorndon core near the neutral zone thats all i know i swear it
enjoy your dinner

as soon as i heard this barolian ship was at the galorndon core i started to think romulans
and the romulans are suddenly very interested in bonding with the vulcans spock has been meeting with the new senate proconsul about reunification
reunification
the proconsul says that he is prepared to endorse peace talks
and spock
the ambassador is sceptical but he cares a great deal about reunification as long as theres a chance of success hes prepared to pursue it
im afraid i dont see how a stolen vulcan ship fits into all this
neither do i counsellor how soon can you be at galorndon core number one
a little over eight hours
well this may prove to be a wild goose chase but i dont see that we have any other choice do you
agreed
we are losing our romulan carrier wave sir
well advise you further as soon as you reach your destination number one picard out

ensign set a course to galorndon core take us to warp eight
aye sir

captain the romulan subspace logs identify a transmission from the romulan surface to a barolian ship near galorndon core twelve hours ago
galorndon core is along the barolian trade route they trade a great deal with the romulans its probably just routine
this would not appear to be routine i was able to trace the source of the transmission it incorporates the code prefix of romulan intelligence
can you access it
it is a short sequence of numbers one four zero zero
nothing more
no sir

spock ive been looking for you
i have been meeting with the proconsul
does he still speak of reunification
he speaks of nothing else

have you ever seen these

the syllabic nucleus of the vulcan language
they were my toys when i was small
your parents wanted you to learn to understand vulcan
yes as did their parents before them to prepare us for the day when we would live again with our vulcan cousins
your friends from the federation have returned they need to see you immediately ive told pardek hell meet you at the cave

the only communication that was sent were the numbers one four zero zero
what does it mean
it means that the proconsul has apparently been attempting to deceive me for what purpose i cannot say yet but his conversations with me have obviously been part of a greater plan which involves the stolen vulcan ship
how do you know that ambassador
the time the proconsul set for the subspace announcement of our peace initiative is fourteen hundred hours tomorrow one four zero zero
why would they need a vulcan ship
that will become clear very shortly captain picard welcome to romulus i trust youve enjoyed your visit and this is the android i have come to respect in battle
lieutenant commander data
how could they know of this location someone has betrayed us
yes you did
spock weve been friends for eighty years
it is the only logical conclusion you asked me to romulus you arranged the meetings with the proconsul and you knew that picard and data had returned to the surface with new information
the great spock very well senator pardek your service to the romulan people is noted and appreciated
jolan tru spock
do not be distressed your dream of reunification is not dead it will simply take a different form the romulan conquest of vulcan bring them
first officers log supplemental the enterprise has reached galorndon core near the border of the neutral zone

any signs of life mister la forge
negative commander
the romulans could have a cloaked base on the surface
or anywhere else along the neutral zone
sir a coded subspace signal from romulus its the captain
what
maintain position at galorndon core diplomatic initiative appears to be succeeding will advise
the message did employ the proper coded sequence
yeah im sure it did

come in gentlemen take a seat please  excuse me im just finishing up a speech for you mister spock i rather enjoy writing i dont get to do it often in this job
perhaps you would be happier in another job
please feel free to change any words that you wish ive tried to make it sound vulcan a lot of unnecessarily long words in a few hours you will deliver this statement alongside our senate proconsul it will announce to the vulcan people that a peace envoy is on its way from romulus we will transmit it on all federation subspace frequencies
peace envoy in a stolen vulcan ship
actually three vulcan ships captain the enterprise is only aware of the one we stole from qualor two we have been following your investigation it has forced us to make some minor changes one of them a message sent in your name ordering them to stay where they are
the moment those vulcan ships appear in the neutral zone the enterprise will move to intercept
in that event the enterprise will be given more important matters to attend to in the meantime ambassador spock will be telling his people to welcome the peace envoy and when they do our forces will seize control before anyone realises what has happened
do you seriously believe that the federation will not immediately intervene
of course it will and were fully prepared for it but we will be there entrenched and it will be very difficult to get us out once we are reunification will become a fact of life
i will not read this or any other statement
if you do not you will die all of you will die
since it is logical to conclude that you will kill us in any event i choose not to cooperate
i hate vulcans i hate the logic i hate the arrogance very well computer holographic programme spock one by taking advantage of holographic sampling during the last several days we have created a programmable spock run programme
this is ambassador spock of vulcan by now federation sensors are tracking three vulcan ships crossing the neutral zone these ships carry the future of the romulan and vulcan people our long conflict is finally over
freeze we would have preferred an interactive spock who could have responded to questions but this will have to suffice
you can hardly believe this will convince anyone
i dont need to convince them just confuse them long enough to reach vulcan end programme if youll excuse me its time to send our ships on their journey

suggestions
commander data are they still unaware that we have access to their computers
i believe so ambassador
then perhaps you and i can find a way to create a diversion

sir sensors are picking up three vessels crossing the neutral zone vulcan ships
vulcan
whats their heading mister worf
one four three mark zero one two
that would put them on a course to vulcan they dont seem to be in any hurry theyre only moving at warp one commander
worf signal them on subspace request their status geordi see if you can tell if its one of ships weve been looking for
they say they are escorting a peace envoy from romulus to vulcan they request that we monitor federation subspace channels ambassador spock will be making an announcement shortly
perhaps his reunification talks were successful
geordi
none of the transponder signatures matches that of the missing ship they could have been altered ill keep checking
set a course to intercept
sir the captains orders were to maintain
i know the captains orders lieutenant engage


impossible theres no way they could have gotten out of this room
thats far enough

stay right where you are drop your weapons
how did you get in here
drop your weapons

drop your weapons
cease fire holograms

im afraid i dont know too much about romulan disruptor settings

cowboy diplomacy

well done mister data though i dont think you got commander rikers hair quite right
i will be more observant in the future sir
it doesnt matter what you do now spocks announcement will be made in minutes our forces will be on vulcan before you can alert anyone

weve just received a priority one distress call from the colony on dulisian four a massive failure of the environmental support systems theyre going to require evacuation
mister worf any other ships in the vicinity of dulisian four
one sir a rutian archaeological vessel
im sure its not equipped to handle something of this scale will
geordi any update on the vulcan ships
ive checked every sensor display backwards and forwards if the romulans altered them they didnt leave any fingerprints i cant tie any of them to the surplus yard
the vulcan ships have entered federation space maintaining low warp
lay in a new course to dulisian four
incoming message from romulus on all subspace channels
on screen
this is ambassador spock of vulcan by now federation sensors are tracking three vulcan ships crossing the neutral zone these ships carry a romulan invasion force and must be stopped i repeat these ships carry a romulan

doctor contact dulisian four and confirm this distress call i have a feeling it may prove to be a false alarm mister worf how long before we intercept the vulcan ships
fourteen minutes sir

communication lines have been terminated at the transmitter but i am quite certain the message was sent prior to the interruption
well done mister data
youll never get out of this building
i disagree commander after studying the design of this structure i have determined that our best route of escape would be the underground exit to the east of this wing i have disconnected certain security scanners to assist us i am afraid we cannot permit you to warn your guards

not bad

the vulcan defence vessels are also responding the romulan force is retreating toward the neutral zone
theyre not taking those vulcan ships home with them
visual range commander
on screen
romulan warbird decloaking alongside the vulcan ships
red alert

advise the warbird to withdraw from federation space and tell them to leave the vulcan ships where they are
the warbird is powering up its forward disruptor array
ready phasers

there were over two thousand romulan troops on board those ships
they destroyed their own invasion force
rather than let them be taken prisoner stand down red alert mister worf advise the klingon ship to signal us as soon as captain picard and data are safely aboard
aye sir

this way pardek never saw these caves its safe they wont find us here
what will you do now 
what we have always done continue to teach pass on the ideals to a new generation work for the day when new thoughts may be spoken aloud
the federation will welcome that day
captain we will need to reach our transport site in fourteen minutes
i wish you well
thank you thank you captain

captain i will not be coming with you
ambassador
the reason for my coming here has never been more clear the union of vulcan and the romulan people will not be achieved by politics or by diplomacy but it will be achieved the answer has been here before us all along an inexorable evolution toward a vulcan philosophy has already begun like the first vulcans these people are struggling to a new enlightenment it may take decades even centuries for them to reach it but they will reach it and i must help
i have learned it is useless to argue with you once your mind is set
not at all captain i have found our arguments quite useful almost as useful as those i had with my father
would it surprise you to learn that he found them equally valuable
ironically you may know sarek better than his own son does my father and i never chose to meld
i offer you the chance to touch what he shared with me

unification part 


captains log stardate  our terraforming mission to doraf one has been cancelled and the enterprise recalled to starbase two thirty four fleet admiral brackett would not discuss the matter on subspace for reasons she said would soon be clear

i apologise captain for the mystery but we must attempt to contain the information im about to reveal to you at least as long as possible
i must admit youve piqued my curiosity admiral
three weeks ago one of our most celebrated ambassadors an advisor to federation leaders for generations disappeared he left no word of his destination two days ago intelligence reports placed him on romulus and i assure you it was an unauthorised visit computer initiate linkage between this terminal and starbase computer system alpha two nine
linkage complete
a defection
if it is the damage to federation security would be immeasurable taken on romulus by long range scanner computer enhance image in section four delta

captains log stardate  as i study the intelligence reports on ambassador spocks disappearance i cannot help but feel a deeper more personal concern about this mission for i know this man through his father it was barely a year ago that i shared a mind meld with the vulcan sarek now we must meet again as i attempt to find an explanation for his sons actions

well be coming into orbit of vulcan in less than an hour captain
we should tell sareks wife of our plans
already been taken care of shes transporting over at oh seven hundred
and sarek
she says hes too ill to make the trip
the man is dying and its my honour to tell him that his son may have betrayed the federation
how well do you know spock
i met him once what i know of him comes from history books and of course my mind meld with his father
that must cover a lot of ground
not as much as youd imagine sarek and spock well sometimes fathers and sons
understood
oh one other thing take a look at this turned up during an intelligence sweep

metal fragments
what do you make of it
possibly disassembled components identified as vulcan recovered from a downed ferengi vessel
they were found in crates marked medical supplies
contraband
its been sent to vulcan for identification starfleet have requested that we lend a hand

mint tea its been years since ive had it vulcans have some kind of strange concoction they call mint youd never recognise it
perrin do you know why ive come to vulcan i must talk to you about spock
he didnt even say goodbye to his father before he left
is it possible he could have been abducted
no he wrapped up all of his affairs carefully he knew he was going
do you have any idea why he might have disappeared like this
captain as far as im concerned he disappeared a long time ago
would it be inappropriate to ask what happened between you and spock
not between us between spock and his father they had argued for years that was family but when the debates over the cardassian war began he attacked sareks position publicly he showed no loyalty to his father
i was not aware that sarek was offended by spocks opposition
i was offended i made sure spock knew it im very protective of my husband i do not apologise for it
does sarek have any idea why spock might have left
i dont know if you could see sarek as i do wasting in bed whispering to himself he wants to see his son he wants to heal any rift that may still remain now it may be too late
perrin would you allow me to see sarek
if it were anyone else i would never permit it but you are a part of him and he of you


the vulcans havent figure out what these fragments are but theyve determined that the metal is a dentarium alloy
that pretty well indicates that theyre vulcan and dentarium also means that whatever this was it was originally designed for use in space from the look of the damage it mustve been a high speed impact
yeah a ferengi cargo ship that went down in the hanolin asteroid belt the debris was spread over a hundred square kilometres
could it be a weapons array
that was my first thought but the vulcans have no record of any stolen weapons or stolen parts for that matter
this is going to be like putting together a big jigsaw puzzle when you dont know even know what the pictures supposed to be
yep


he is like this most of the time his emotions have taken over sometimes i can bring him out of it sarek you will listen
go from me
picard is here
no more chaos no more
i will leave you alone with him he will either acknowledge you or he wont

sarek ive come a long way to see you
i will not answer
i must speak to you about your son
i wish no one with me
about spock
spock
yes hes missing
is that you picard
hello old friend
youre here on vulcan
i need your help i must find spock
hes not here
i know hes been reported on romulus
on romulus
yes
why
i had hoped to find that out from you
on romulus youre going there arent you to find him

yes do you have any idea what might have taken him to romulus
no
is there anyone on romulus he might know or choose to contact
pardek
who is pardek
it could be pardek
who is pardek
he is a romulan senator spock has maintained a relationship with him over the years i dont know how they met at the khitomer conference id imagine
pardek represented romulus
yes im sure he did in fact i recall spock coming to me with optimism about a continuing dialogue with the romulans i told him it was illogical to maintain such an expectation spock was always so impressionable this romulan pardek had no support at home of course in the end i was proven correct i gave spock the benefit of experience of logic he never listened never listened
its been suggested that spock might have defected
never i will accept many things but never that
but you believe he might have gone there to see pardek
the romulan senator how do you know pardek
ive heard of him
thats what hes done hes gone to see pardek
do you know what business they might have together
no i never knew what spock was doing when he was a boy he would disappear for days into the mountains i asked him where he had gone what he had done he refused to tell me i insisted that he tell me he would not i forbade him to go he ignored me i punished him he endured it silently but always he returned to the mountains one might as well ask the river not to run  but secretly i admired him the proud core of him that would not yield
sarek were a part of each other i know that he has caused you pain but i also know that you love him
tell him picard

peace and long life
live long and and live long and spock my son
and prosper
captains log stardate  to cross the neutral zone i will require a cloaked ship to that end i have set a course for the klingon home world after all we did for gowron during the recent war i am certain he will be happy to return a favour

still no response from the klingons mister worf
no sir
hes ignoring me what other explanation is there
seems after hailing him for three days he couldve found a minute to talk to you
sir
yes lieutenant
i believe i know why our messages are not being answered gowron has been rewriting klingon history
rewriting history
yes he is claiming it was his courage his genius which brought an end to the civil war
i see
in the new version there is no mention made of the federations help in his rise to power
if worfs right then our arrival would be an uncomfortable reminder of the facts
he can take all the credit he wants i dont caret but i do need a ship well if gowron wont talk to me get someone who will somebody on the high council ktal perhaps
yes sir

captain i have a visual identification of senator pardek of romulus this is a barolian record of a trade negotiation in which pardek participated four years ago
thats all
yes sir
run it again computer freeze call up the intelligence scan of spock on romulus computer enhance far left figure and compare same man pardek one question answered what do we know of him
he has been in public service since he was a young man a senator for nine decades he is considered a man of the people he has sponsored many reforms reportedly romulan leadership considers him to be somewhat of a radical because he has been an advocate of peace throughout his career
i can see why spock would cultivate a relationship with him where would we find him other than on the floor of the romulan senate
the district he represents is called the krocton segment he maintains a dwelling there
thank you mister data
there is more sir i have taken the liberty of expanding the parameters of my search and have discovered that pardek has several relatives in the krocton segment i believe you will be able to locate him there on the third day of the romulan week when the senate is not in session
mister data your resourcefulness never ceases to amaze me
thank you sir
captain we are being hailed by the klingon home world
gowron or ktal
neither sir it is the junior adjutant to the diplomatic delegation
junior adjutant
name
bijik sir
on screen
greetings captain i regret to inform you that gowron and the high council are quite busy and wont be able to speak with you today
is gowron aware that we have been transmitting messages for the past three days
captain gowron wishes it were possible to talk with everyone who wants an audience but he is one man the demands on his time are formidable if you would like me to take him a message
a message very well tell gowron leader of the high council of the klingon empire that his arbiter of succession jeanluc picard needs a favour
a favour
i require a cloaked vessel
a cloaked vessel this is no small favour captain
it is for a mission that could have repercussions throughout the quadrant
how would it benefit the klingon empire im sure gowron will ask
the only benefit to the klingon empire would be our gratitude
that is what you want me to tell him
yes and please add that if he is unable to provide a ship then i am sure there are others in the klingon empire who would be willing to help me and then they would have our gratitude
i see
also please tell him that i am immensely gratified that he is prospering so well a tribute to his skilled leadership

theyre not removable are they data
removable
your ears
no doctor they are fully integrated components
well have to do some moulds of his ears as well
what about his skin colour
well have to do some tests on his skin pigmentation changing it to appear romulan shouldnt be too difficult we just have to make sure we can change it back again afterwards your right eye is point zero zero four higher than your left

nobodys perfect doctor but
if you want a proper fit to your prosthetic trust your tailor
anything from gowron
no sir but after your tailor is done would you join me in the cargo bay mister la forge has made some progress with the metal fragments
these two still have an appointment with mister mott to have their hairpieces designed
thirty minutes number one

what we seem to have here is a navigational deflector array or at least whats left of one
why would anyone want a vulcan shield array
beats me commander every question we answer here seems to bring up two more
youre certain this is vulcan
yes sir metallurgical analysis confirmed that and by running a molecular pattern trace we were actually able to identify the ship as tpau it was decommissioned years ago and sent to the surplus depot at qualor two as far as anybody knows its still there
worf to captain picard
yes lieutenant
a klingon vessel is decloaking off our port bow compliments of gowron
mister worf will you convey my gratitude to the captain and advise him that mister data and i will be transporting over shortly
aye sir
id like to take the enterprise to qualor two sir see whats out there
agreed thank you mister la forge

i know my duty captain when i am given orders i follow them but i do not like secrets i want to know why we are going on this mission
im sorry its a classified matter
youre going after the defector arent you
defector
do you think information like that stays a secret ambassador spock has gone to romulus and you are going after him
captain your orders are to take us to a set of coordinates near romulus and to bring us back and that is all i am prepared to discuss
if we are discovered by the romulans it means death for us all
i realise that
hechu ghos very well captain we have set a course for romulus

it may not be what youre used to on a starfleet ship
quite nice thank you
captain kvada is this the captains quarters or my own
both we have limited space we are a military ship not a pleasure craft
of course this will be fine
youll sleep klingon style we do not soften our bodies by putting down a pad
good i prefer it that way
youll take your meals with us but we do not serve federation food
ive been looking forward gagh havent had it for quite a while very fresh
meh hod
jatlh
mehmah ghos
sowlchu well captain were at the border of the neutral zone you mean to do this do you
yes i do
first officers log stardate  the enterprise is nearing qualor two home of a federation surplus depot operated by the zakdorn we hope to find out how the salvaged deflector array ended up in the hands of the ferengi

i have made contact commander
on screen im commander william riker from the federation starship enterprise
klim dokachin quartermaster surplus depot zed one five
i need some information about a vulcan ship the tpau it was sent to you a few years ago
did you arrange an appointment
an appointment no
then i will be unable to help you you may communicate with scheduling

who does he think he is
the quartermaster of the supply yard with information you need
right mister worf reestablish communication
aye sir
mister dokaychin
dokachin klim dokachin
mister dokachin the information i need involves a matter of major importance to the federation ill need access to your logs your files my people can do the work
i dont allow outsiders into my computer system
all right one of your people can do the work
i wish i had the people to spare but i dont
well sir what would you suggest
i dont know contact me when you reach orbit

i dont believe this
hes king of his particular hill commander youll have to treat him that way
counsellor this feels like a perfect job for you

thank you for coming on board mister dokachin
quite a ship you have
weve tied into your computers if youd like to access the files
i dont usually see them in such good condition by the time they get to me theyre always falling apart
mister dokachin we must find this ship and youre the only one who can help us
who are you
deanna troi ships counsellor
he probably figures that we dont get to see a lot of handsome women out this way and someone like you might get a little more cooperation from me hes probably right what was the name of that ship the tpau  the tpau vulcan registry there logged in stardate 
wheres the ship now
docked section eighteen gamma twelve do you want me to take you there
id appreciate it
helmsman lay in a heading one four one by two zero eight ahead slow two hundred kph i suppose this is your first visit to a junkyard isnt it youd be surprised at some of the things i find on board these ships i once found a fourteen foot caldorian eel on board a freighter in someones locker
are you serious
if you have time ill show it to you i still have it nursed her back to health
we are approaching the designated coordinates commander
on screen

what where is it what happened to it these are the correct coordinates
the tpau is missing
the tpau is missing
how could a ship disappear from your depot
im not accustomed to losing things commander i will find your ship for you i have the tpau crossreferenced in four different directories
when it was brought here was it stripped of material armament sensors
of course
can you tell us what happened to its navigational deflector
it was routed to the tripoli a holding vessel on the outer rim of the shipyard
its not there any more whats left of that deflector is laid out on the floor of our cargo bay
how can that be
perhaps we should to pay a visit to the tripoli

in all the time that the zakdorn have operated this depot nothing has ever been lost never
approaching the coordinates of the tripoli sir
on screen

i do not understand this this is not possible we beam goods to the tripoli on a regular schedule there was a shipment yesterday another is set for today it must be there
when is todays transport
just over two hours from now a shipment of deuterium storage tanks
ensign align the enterprise so we appear to be one of the abandoned ships mister la forge when were in position shut down the engines and all systems except sensors and life support
aye sir
ive a feeling somebodys going to be here to receive those storage tanks id be very interested to know who that is

these quarters were obviously intended for one crewmember sir there is but a single sleeping space
im sure the klingons found it amusing to put us in here together
since i do not require sleep i propose you take the shelf sir i am content to stand
very well mister data thank you

are you comfortable sir
i suppose so
good night captain sleep well sir
thank you
what are you doing
sir was i making noise sir
no not exactly
i was processing all of the information we have accumulated on romulan society i am preparing for the task of impersonating a romulan
i see
would you like me to discontinue sir
no please go on
what are you looking at
i am not looking at anything sir i am continuing to organise my files
but youre looking at me
i am sorry if i was disturbing you sir i will not look in your direction

do you not wish to sleep sir
i dont think so mister data lets go on with the files
i would be happy to i have been studying the krocton segment as you asked and have selected an appropriate site for our transport
captain kvada to picard please come to the bridge

captain weve monitored a subspace message that might interest you

sarek is dead

commander sensors detect a ship approaching at warp speed
identification
negative no transponder signal no subspace marker
sounds like they dont want to be identified
the ship is coming out of warp sir
on screen
sensors indicate a combat vessel origin undetermined heavily armed mass and density suggest that its fully loaded with cargo id say from these internal scans a good deal of that cargo is weaponry
the ship is entering sector twelve delta four
hes taking the position assigned to the tripoli the coordinates are identical
commander readings indicate surface to ship transport has begun
mister la forge bring the engines back online and restore all systems to normal
aye sir
hes powering up engines turning to starboard
open a channel
open
this is commander william riker of the uss enterprise identify yourself i repeat you have entered a federation depot identify yourself
sir the ship is locking phasers
shields up red alert
that ship easily matches our armament commander
its coming about
if you do not respond to our hails we will take that as evidence of hostile action
there is an energy build up in their phaser banks sir theyre activating weapons

forward shields down to seventy two percent
boost power to the shields
aye sir
mister worf lock onto their weapon systems only and prepare to fire

forward shields down to sixty eight percent aft shields forty percent
on my mark point seven five burst we just want to get their attention
ready sir
fire
their forward shields are damaged sir
we destroyed one of their phaser arrays looks like collateral damage in the cargo area commander im picking up massive power fluctuations internal explosions with all the armament that ship is carrying its going to blow


well mister data what do you think

i would not have thought it possible sir i am eager to test the success of our efforts it does remain to be seen if the romulans will accept us captain you have seemed unusually pensive since we received the news of ambassador sareks death
sarek and i share a particular bond our lives touched in an unusual way i admit i feel the effects of his death the tenor of this mission has changed mister data at least it has for me we were sent to confront spock about his disappearance now i also have to tell him that his father is dead
i do not entirely understand sir as a vulcan ambassador spock would simply see death as the logical result of his fathers illness
its never quite that simple not even for a vulcan certainly not for spock who is halfhuman years spent in conflict and now the chance to resolve all of those differences is gone
considering the exceptionally long lifespan of vulcans it does seem odd that sarek and spock did not choose to resolve those differences in the time allowed
father and son both proud both stubborn more alike than either of them were prepared to admit a lifetime spent building emotional barriers theyre very difficult to break down and now the time has come its too late its a difficult moment its a lonely one its a moment spock is about to face

dont you two look sweet be careful android some romulan beauty might take a liking to you lick that paint right off your ears you do you know what the romulans will do to you if they discover who you are
i have a good idea were ready to transport down to the surface
just so we understand each other my orders dont include rescue missions


ah senator pardek you received my message
i got here as quickly as i could proconsul
what do you know of this human jeanluc picard a starfleet captain
i know nothing of him
you havent seen him recently
to my knowledge i have never seen him
i have received intelligence indicating hes on his way here perhaps here already
here on romulus
yes curious isnt it i suppose wed better find out if the report is accurate or merely rumour circulate his likeness among the security forces remind them that if he is here hes probably disguised as one of us
ill see to it

this is definitely the street on which the intelligence scan of spock and pardek was taken sir adjusting for the optical distortions i am able to verify the architectural features
where were they standing data youre moving about in a very well android way
i am sorry captain i will be more careful
dont call me captain
i understand sir i have found the place where they were standing
where
it is here at this doorway a legal intercessors office the name is similar to pardeks it would appear to be one of his relatives

hes not open for business yet
nonetheless i recommend we keep this location under observation i have clearly determined pardeks routine on days when the senate is not in session he invariably comes to this section after the median hour
very well lets sample the local cuisine shall we


do you happen to know what time the intercessors office across the way opens
why do you want to know
i need his services he was recommended
i havent seen you here before
we are here for the day from the city of rateg
rateg i dont think so
why do you say that
you dont sound like youre from rateg
it is a misconception that all rategs speak with a particular inflection in fact there are twelve different
we come from several kilometres outside the city
or perhaps you come from the security forces to watch the intercessors office is he in trouble
youre mistaken madam
doesnt matter to me i dont know when he opens eat your soup courtesy of a loyal establishment jolan tru

i dont think we can stay here too long
we may not have to direct your view to the far corner sir
very good senator
senator we seem to be having some problems
is that not pardek
i believe it is
perhaps you should appear to enjoy your soup sir
 ill take care of that come

do not move
what youve made a mistake
quiet come with us


wait here
for what what have you brought us here for
welcome to romulus captain picard dont let our soldiers frighten you we had to get you off the street as quickly as we could romulan security knows that youre here i am pardek you are among friends captain
i have come on an urgent mission from the federation im looking for ambassador spock
indeed you have found him captain picard
to be continued
a matter of time

captains log stardate  the enterprise is on its way to penthara four where a type c asteroid has struck an unpopulated continent the resulting dust cloud could very well create a phenomenon not unlike the nuclear winters of twenty first century earth commander la forge has begun work on a plan that would counteract the devastation

im afraid the numbers coming in are already indicating climatic changes commander
what kind of drop can we expect
if the pentharan spheral forecasts are correct ten to twelve degrees celsius within the first ten days
if it continues like that their entire ecosystem will be shot to hell
and i doubt theyre prepared to cope with the kind of cold thats coming
commander riker
yes sir

would you join me on the bridge please
right away sir
are you certain mister worf
there was a spacetime distortion sir and there is something back there we passed within three hundred kilometres of it
its too close to be a coincidence mister la forge
yes captain
would a delay of one hour affect your plans

not unless another asteroid decides to pay a call on penthara sir
the odds of that occurring captain are extremely unlikely given the time frame
thank you mister data

ensign bring the ship about lets take a look at mister worfs distortion
aye sir
mister worfs what
the lieutenants sensors detected a temporal distortion almost in our current course theres a small object back there that wasnt there a few moments ago
the object is fifty kilometres ahead sir
full stop ensign
aye sir
on screen
dimensions worf
approximately five metres in length sir
lifesigns
no signs of any kind our sensors do not penetrate the hull
try hailing it
thats odd
whats odd
weve received a response sir but
yes mister worf
they want you to move over sir
reply that the enterprise isnt going anywhere lieutenant
not the enterprise captain you
what are you trying to tell me

oops excuse me captain but you were standing right where i needed to be
who are you
rasmussens the name sir professor berlinghoff rasmussen ah this is wonderful actually quite a bit larger than i thought
really
where i come from every historian knows the bridge of old d
where exactly do you come from
why earth late twenty sixth century earth to be exact ive travelled back nearly three hundred years just to find you


exactly what kind of historian are you
my focus is on the twenty second through the twenty fourth centuries early interstellar history you know it was always believed this was on your desk not here fascinating dont move it on my account
you cant expect me to believe that the layout of my ready room can possibly be of interest to future historians
no less so than your legendary modesty captain if i could describe to you what a thrill it is to be here  this is the original
you flatter me professor but i cant help but wonder what could possibly have caused you to select me as the subject of your study even in this decade there are far wiser and more experienced humans in and out of starfleet
id love to tell you picard i really would but try and imagine what a young caesar might have done differently had someone had given him a hint of what lay ahead or if lincoln had been coerced into changing his theatre plans i truly wish i could be more specific on why you were selected but im afraid the exchange of information will have to flow in one direction only  five six seven metres ha i was right

why now
right if youve came back to study us to study the captain why would you pick today why not a year ago or a year from now
oh i picked the right day all right just wait youll see do you always sit there on that side of the table
usually why
its not important
professor at what point does time travel become a tool for historians
now now commander you know better than that ive studied a great deal about your century including the fact that youre all quite aware of the dangers of anyone altering the past and thats exactly what id be doing if i were to divulge information like that
telurian plague
i beg your pardon
the telurian plague was it cured i mean did they find the cure by your century oh it cant do any harm to ask that
i realise that its difficult but we must keep to ourselves questions regarding the future go on professor
ill be preparing questionnaires for each of you please complete them at your convenience if youre concerned about a possible breach of security im sure your captain can make a determination and thank you in advance for curbing your curiosity
if i hand my assignment in on time can i get a glimpse into next weeks poker game
mister data would you escort the professor to his quarters
this way sir

what did he mean he picked the right day
you know everything i do will
deanna
its hard to tell but he is holding something back
of course he is all the things he could tell us all the things he would like to tell us
it might be that i dont know
what if hes an imposter god knows weve seen enough of them
he is human the medical scans have proved that right doctor
hes human all right
and there was a temporal distortion back there correct mister worf
yes sir
and no one can deny that ship of his is unlike anything weve ever seen before
the hull is made of some kind of plasticised tritanium mesh weve nothing like it on record at least not till now
mister worf i do appreciate your caution i share it bring his vessel into the shuttlebay place it under guard
yes sir
i realise that this visit is going to be difficult for some of us but ive examined his credentials and everything seems to be in order so i think we should extend to him every courtesy
including questionnaires
including questionnaires mister worf


this is really a thrill data like running across a redstone missile or a gutenberg bible to think the model t of androids

if youre referring to the first production model automobile of the twentieth century perhaps the subsequent model a might be a more apt analogy since i am doctor noonian soongs revised prototype
i stand corrected

is there a problem professor
i suppose it will have to do for now ill get you a list of the things ill be needing okay
would i be correct professor in assuming that you know whether or not i am still alive in the twenty sixth century

since you seemed to know so much about captain picard and the ship i assumed that you would
itd be best if you kept your assumptions to yourself wouldnt it
yes sir sorry sir
captains log stardate  we have arrived at penthara four and can see for ourselves the atmospheric devastation caused by the asteroid impact


weve located three underground pockets of carbon dioxide here here and here our drilling phasers can release enough of the gas to form an envelope which would temporarily hold in the heat of the sun
weve spend years decades trying to avoid anything that would lead to a greenhouse effect and now here we are about to create one on purpose
less than twenty percent of your normal sunlight is getting through that dust doctor if we can hold enough heat in with the co that should give the planet time to mend itself
excuse me doctor moseley
what now
new seattles reporting a cloud depth of twelve kilometres two rivers tropical rivers are beginning to freeze
wed better get started before theres nothing left to mend


look whos here
i hate questionnaires
professor come and join us
i hope im not intruding
not at all im sure youre the topic of conversation at every table in this room
as i promised here are your assignments im sure theyll be painless please try and complete them by tomorrow

tomorrow
no problem professor
youre all very calm
is there some reason we shouldnt be
history always records where people were what they were doing when important events took place but it rarely remembers their activities say a week before or a day or even an hour
are you suggesting that an important event is imminent
i didnt say that did i please just go on doing what you were doing and pretend im not here
why is there no record of other future historians travelling back to witness important events
were obviously very careful as a matter of fact a colleague and i recently paid a call on a twenty second century vessel
they hadnt perfected quarantine fields you probably saw some surgical masks and gloves
isnt it fascinating how everyone has different interests when it comes to history different perspectives on progress

would you mind telling me what that is
just checking the time no problem
is something important supposed to be happening here
no its nothing nothing what about you commander what do you see as the most important example of progress in the last two hundred years
i suppose the warp coil before there was warp drive humans were confined to a single sector of the galaxy
spoken like the consummate explorer
what is going on are you expecting someone
phasers
i beg your pardon
there were no phasers in the nd century
ah you see doctor our klingon friend is a perfect example of what i was trying to tell you he views history through the eyes of a hunter a warrior his passion lies in the perfection of the tools of violence how delightfully primitive

 as soon as we input this atmospheric data from moseley the computer should tell us how many holes well have to punch
what have you learned about the tectonic stability around the drilling sites
couldnt be better our scans were all clear and moseley says there hasnt been so much as a quiver down there in well over a century
ah ha just the two im looking for ive brought you the forms i need you to complete shouldnt take any more than a couple of hours
were kind of busy here professor tomorrow would probably be better data weve got about twenty three thousand thermal simulations you think you could check them through for anomalies
certainly

is that as fast as he can go
not fast enough for you professor
theres little known about datas efficiency almost nothing about his part in this mission its a topic of great conjecture
two hundred nine anomalies all within acceptable parameters
thanks data youre here to witness this mission thats it isnt it
itd be best if you just thought of me as a fly on the wall and went about your business
i will have your answered questions as soon as possible professor
data at penthara four
if youll excuse me
your prosthesis what do you call it again
a visor
visor right a visor you know i have a picture of you wearing that in my office how do you like it
it allows me to see i like it just fine
you know homer was blind and milton bach monet wonder
a fly on the wall huh
a fly on the wall
the computer has configured the drilling pattern and specified depths
captain weve got everything we need im ready to transport down to the surface
ill notify doctor moseley good luck geordi
gentlemen

who said these moments were any less exciting when you know the outcome
i know of no one who said that professor

the enterprise will monitor the co concentrations at six different altitudes if all goes well it shouldnt take more than twenty bore sites
lets hope all goes well
la forge to commander riker how are you doing
weve gotten word from the monitoring stations theyre all online were ready when you are geordi
thats excellent all we need now is an open channel to data

open a channel mister worf and prepare to fire at target one
the computer has locked in phaser depth calculations
mister data
ready sir
fire


target one is emitting two thousand cubic metres per second

target two one thousand six hundred
surface wind patterns over the target are stable
you picking up anything at altitude data

co concentrations remain unchanged at upper elevations

have i missed much
target fourteen complete sir
data

what have you got
no change sir

how are the surface winds geordi
holding steady sir

the computer has stopped drilling
you should be getting something

now data
elevated co levels at twenty kilometres sir
now youre

talking weve got some new temperatures coming in
all thermal monitoring stations are reporting no further temperature drops
correction doctor two equatorial stations are showing slight increases
thank you thank you all youve given us what we need time

were glad to be of help doctor the enterprise will remain in orbit and continue to monitor your progress picard out
youve given us what we need time
ensign return to synchronous orbit
aye sir
very clever picard and well done weve always known how you did it but to experience the moment to witness the nuances its indescribable


hes after more than a history lesson i can tell you that
what is it what are you getting from him
i dont know its like hes trying to confuse us misdirect us somehow

there you are well that certainly was exciting wasnt it
professor is everything alright are you well
yes couldnt be better thank you i just thought we might chat about your questionnaire buck up crewman youre a credit to that uniform
ive got some things to take care of
no please counsellor i would very much appreciate your remaining
doctor in response to my sixth question you spoke of a neural stimulator may i see one
i dont see why not give me a minute

you dont like me very much do you
i dont dislike you professor
 keep your eyes wide soldier youll be telling your grandchildren how you were there at penthara four but you dont trust me you should you know
should i
picards empath wont trust you thats what they all said
picards empath
were not that unalike you and i you possess a sense that is foreign to the others my knowledge of the future is similar you know some of my best friends are empaths they trust me
why should you care whether i trust you or not
were birds of a feather were colleagues we could learn a lot from each other
youre right i dont trust you
i knew youd say that
im sure you did

well its nice to see you two are finally getting along
i really have to be going

thank you
 why dont you try a berylite scan id be interested to see where his microlevels are

so what else can i show you
youre a very curious woman no no i dont mean curious like that i mean youre curious about things about berylite levels about the future
well curiosity is why all of us are out here isnt it
i understand but youre different youre more vibrant more
more vibrant thats nice i like that
you know whenever i travel back i meet very interesting people men and women but ive never anyone who gave me thoughts about not going home
youre not supposed to be influencing the past remember and i am beginning to feel a little influenced anyway i could be your great great great great grandmother

what kind of questions did he have for you number one
all he wanted to know about was previous starships what i thought was innovative about the last enterprise the one before that he said he wanted to see if we had a grasp of the fundamentals
his queries to me primarily focused on doctor soongs

captain i am detecting a massive earthquake on the surface two earthquakes
location
both epicentres are beneath the two southernmost drill sites captain
is la forge still down there
yes sir
find him
weve also got some volcanic activity pretty severe
magnify
la forge here captain moseley and i are on our way back to his lab
are you all right
were okay but those were pretty big sir if this was earth id say around an eight or an eight five on the richter scale were starting to see some volcanic plumes captain
two more eruptions sir
it is likely that we overestimated the geologic stability around the co pockets captain
were in the lab sir
on screen
were fairly well quakeproof down here picard its the volcanic dust im worried about
what about the dust
the ash the volcanoes are throwing into the atmosphere is going to compound the existing problem in a matter of days therell be no sunlight getting through those clouds
no amount of co will help us then
captain take a look at this  these are the coordinates of the eruptions and these are the coordinates of the phaser drilling sites
the mantle is collapsing where the pressure was released
captain doctor moseley and i have a couple of ideas but its going to take some time to sort out
sort them out commander
aye sir
we came here to help these people
and look what weve done


what in gods name is that
music professor
music
yes sir mozarts jupiter symphony in c major bachs brandenburg concerto number three beethovens ninth symphony second movement molto vivace and la donna e mobile from verdis rigoletto
do you think you could thin it out a bit

how the hell can you listen to four pieces of music at the same time
actually i am capable of distinguishing over one hundred and fifty simultaneous compositions but in order to analyse the aesthetics i try to keep it to ten or less
only four today
i am assisting commander la forge with a very complex calculation it demands a great deal of my concentration
well i came to thank you for answering my questions though i probably should have asked you to limit yourself to fifty thousand words
you did ask me to be thorough
i realise its hard to believe data but very few records of doctor soongs work survived to the twenty sixth century so it would be invaluable to myself and other historians if you could provide us with some schematics
certainly as soon as my work here is completed
as long as its before oh nine hundred tomorrow thats when ill be heading back
bridge to commander data
yes worf
commander la forge is hailing you from the surface sir
patch him through please
have you rerun the phase reversal figures data
there were no errors geordi the variance must be no more than point zero six terawatts
well i dont see any other choice well continue to run the numbers down here but i doubt well come up with anything different you better inform the captain of the good news and the bad news la forge out

which do you suppose hes going to want to hear first

the good news
the motion of the dust has created a great deal of electrostatic energy in the upper atmosphere with a modified phaser blast we could create a shock front that would encircle the planet and ionise the particles
that would be like striking a spark in a gasfilled room
with one exception sir the particles would be converted into a high energy plasma which our shields could absorb and then redirect harmlessly into space
turn the enterprise into a lightning rod
precisely sir
and the bad news
if our phaser discharge is off by as little as point zero six terawatts it would cause a cascading exothermal inversion
meaning
we would completely burn off the planets atmosphere
captains log supplemental while doctor moseley takes la forges plan to the leaders of the colony i find myself weighing the potential consequences of a more philosophical issue

come

i imagine you know why ive asked you here
yeah i have a fairly good idea
im faced with a dilemma there is a planet beneath us which is slowly turning to ice and unless we do something about it im told that in a matter of weeks thousands maybe tens of thousands will die
thatd be a shame
yes it would it would be quite a shame
so whats your dilemma
commander la forge has a possible solution the margins of error are extremely critical but if successful therell be no more threat
and if its not successful
every living thing on the planet will perish
so do nothing and thousands will die do something and millions could die thats a tough choice
not if you were to help me
youre not suggesting i tell you the outcome of your efforts
oh no im not everything that starfleet stands for everything that i have ever believed in tells me i cannot ask you that but at the same time there are twenty million lives down there and you know what happened to them what will happen to them
so it seems you have another dilemma one that questions your convictions
well ive never been afraid of reevaluating my convictions professor and now i have twenty million reasons to do so
and why did you ask to see me
because your presence gives me potential access to a kind of information that ive never had available to me before and if i am to reexamine my beliefs then i must take advantage of every possible asset it would be irresponsible of me not to ask you here
however you come to terms with your beliefs captain i must tell you that im quite comfortable with mine
how can you be how can you be comfortable watching people die
let me put it to you this way if i were to tell you that none of those people died youd easily conclude that you tried your solution and it succeeded so youd confidently try again no harm in that but what if i were to tell you they all died what then obviously youd decide not to make the same mistake twice now what if one of those people grew up
yes professor i know what if one of those lives i save down there is a child who grows up to be the next adolf hitler or khan singh every first year philosophy student have been asked that question ever since the earliest wormholes were discovered but this is not a class in temporal logic its not theoretical its not hypothetical its real surely you see that
i see it all too well but you must see that if i were to influence you everything in this sector in this quadrant of the galaxy could change history my history would unfold in a way other than it already has now what possible incentive could anyone offer me to allow that to happen
i have two choices either way one version of history or another will wend its way forward the history you know or another one now who is to say which is better what i do know is here today one way millions of lives could be saved now isnt that incentive enough
everyone dies captain its just a question of when all of those people down there died years before i was born all of you up here as well so you see i cant get quite as worked up as you over the fate of some colonists who for me have been dead a very very long time
of course you know of the prime directive which tells us that we have no right to interfere with the natural evolution of alien worlds now i have sworn to uphold it but nevertheless i have disregarded that directive on more than one occasion because i thought it was the right thing to do now if you are holding on to some temporal equivalent of that directive then isnt it possible that you have an occasion here to make an exception to help me to choose because its the right thing to do
were not just talking about a choice it sounds to me like youre trying to manipulate the future
every choice we make allows us to manipulate the future do i ask adrienne or suzanne to the spring dance do i take my holiday on corsica or on risa a persons life their future hinges on each of a thousand choices living is making choices now you ask me to believe that if i make a choice other than the one found in your history books then your past will be irrevocably altered well you know professor perhaps i dont give a damn about your past because your past is my future and as far as im concerned it hasnt been written yet
captain the electrostatic conditions are about as good as theyre going to get if were going to try this nows the time
please dont ask me captain i cant help you im sorry

how long will it take to programme the phasers number one
weve just got to tie in geordis atmospheric sensors
so youve made your choice after all and without my help
oh on the contrary professor you were quite helpful
hows that
by refusing to assist me you left me with the same choice i had to began with to try or not to try to take a risk or to play it safe your arguments have reminded me how precious the right to choose is and because ive never been one to play it safe i choose to try mister data programme the firing sequence
aye sir
captains log stardate  doctor moseley has met with the colony leaders who all agree they are willing to take the risk

warp power has being rerouted to the main deflector dish commander
keep those phasers on active surge control worf were only going to get one shot at this
well this is it
you have the sequence locked in data
yes sir after an eight point three second burst from the dish well discharge all eps taps through the phasers
its time for you return to the ship mister la forge mister obrien stand by to transport
excuse me captain but i can be of a lot more help down here weve going to have to compensate for density variations right up to the last second
doctor moseleys computers can accomplish the same task sir but geordi would be better able to anticipate unexpected variances
mister la forge you know better than anyone theres no guarantee this will work if it fails
theres no guarantee its going to fail captain id like your permission to remain here on the surface
permission granted
la forge remained below
good luck commander
thank you captain

the deflector dish has been reconfigured captain
proceed mister data
stand by for autophaser interlock activating deflector beam
eps taps online phasers firing

activating shield invertors now

mister la forge
la forge here still breathing captain
weve got particulate levels right where theyre supposed to be and the sun is shining
you see captain i told you there was nothing to worry about
report back to the ship when youre ready commander doctor well stay in orbit and analyse the remaining volcanic disturbances but the best advice would be to let them cool down on their own
im getting in the habit of thanking you picard

well id love to see more but its nearly time for me to go i am tickled pink to have had the opportunity of witnessing this picard and you did it all without any help well must run got some packing to do you know youre taller in person commander


well would you look at this who would have expected a teary farewell
im afraid were going to have to take a look in your vessel
curious till the end eh captain you cant be serious picard weve been through this more than once
a number of objects have been discovered missing in the last two days and if theyre in your possession then we would like them returned
im not here in search of relics im sure theyll turn up
if you will not open the vessel i will with explosives if necessary
i doubt you have the means
if we dont get in that thing i guarantee you dont either
considering the sensitive nature of my equipment i think youll understand if i request that only mister data be allowed to see it
why data
because if i order data never to divulge what he sees in there he wont with the exception of anything that might belong to us
understood sir
back in a minute



i do not believe any of these items belong to you professor
nor does this this phaser is set at the highest stun setting if im correct that is sufficient to immobilise even you
why have you stolen these objects to put in a museum
far too valuable for that you see in the century i come from they havent even been invented yet
but this vessel and the temporal distortion that coincided with your arrival
oh this is a time pod and it is from the twenty sixth century at least thats what the poor fellow said you see he decided to travel back to the twenty second century thats my time and he had the misfortune of meeting me his clothes fit quite well dont you think took me weeks to figure out how to work this thing
then you are not an historian
more of an inventor up till a few weeks ago a dismally unsuccessful one
what are your intentions professor
well thanks to your captain it seems my intentions have changed slightly i was quite content with the notion of returning with those trinkets id invent about one a year but now look what fortune has graced me with you will take a little longer to figure out than a tricorder but it should be well worth the effort if the auto timer is programmed the way i think it is in about two minutes we should be on our way back to a place called new jersey im afraid you wont be awake for the ride

i assume your hand print will open the door whether you are conscious or not

that weapon was working yesterday
you were correct to suspect him sir but he is not from the future he is from the past
trying to make my history unfold in a way other than it already has eh professor
this was all a misunderstanding picard just let me back in there and well forget the whole thing
now what possible incentive could anyone offer me to allow that
i believe you will find all of the missing items in the vessel sir
doctor
a very nice performance
not all of it some of it was real captain
he claims to be a twenty second century inventor captain
a pity you werent a bit more inventive if fewer things had disappeared we might never have suspected you as it was the only stumbling block was your ship our sensors couldnt penetrate it but once the door was opened the computer was able to detect and deactivate everything youd stolen including this
id love to hear more picard but i really must get back in that pod
take him to a detention cell mister worf and notify starfleet that well be dropping him off at starbase two one four
aye sir
you cant do this ive got to get back i dont belong here

no
im sure there are more than a few legitimate historians at starfleet who will be quite eager to meet a human from your era oh professor welcome to the twenty fourth century
new ground

captains log stardate  we are approaching the planet bilana three where a new method of propulsion known as the soliton wave is being developed the enterprise has been asked to participate in one of the first tests of this new technology

data data isnt this exciting we are going to witness a moment in history
every nanosecond in this continuum is a moment in history once it has elapsed
no no no no i mean were going to see something that people will talk about for years i mean think about it no more bulky warp engines or nacelles a ship just generates a soliton wave and then rides it through space like a surfboard this is going to be like being there to watch chuck yeager break the sound barrier or zephram cochrane engage the first warp drive
it should be interesting
very exciting
im talking to the wrong crowd donaldson donaldson youre an engineer

lieutenant worf you have a subspace communication from the transport ship milan
transfer the signal to this station
hello worf
mother
i hope you dont mind us dropping in on you like this but when i heard the enterprise was to be in this sector we took the first transport and here we are
is father with you
no but i brought alexander with me i thought the two of you would like a chance to visit
very well i will make arrangements for you to come aboard
good

worf worf its so good to see you you look wonderful is that a touch of grey in your beard dont worry the rozhenko men have always had beards of iron grey
hello alexander
hello
it is good to see you both how long can you stay
im not going back

did you see the look on alexanders face when he saw the play area hes going to love it here
mother why does alexander believe he is remaining
lapsang suchong tea please have you been eating you look thin
mother
when your father was in starfleet i always had to make sure that
mother we need to talk about alexander
alexander is a fine boy worf hes smart and hes highspirited like you were at that age sometimes when he comes running through the house and knocks over that big green lamp just like you used to do
i dont remember you smiling when i knocked over that lamp
well maybe once when you werent looking when we learned alexander was to come to live with us we were so happy the house had been so empty since you left and we thought here is our chance to fill it with the sound of children again but the truth is worf your father and i were getting old
mother you both have many years
i dont mean were ready for the grave not yet anyway but were a little less active its harder for us to keep up with alexander were ready to be just grandparents alexander needs to be with his father
mother that is not possible we must find another option
he needs his father worf alexanders hes having difficulties
difficulties
hes disobedient
mother klingon children are often difficult to control
i do know something about how klingon children behave its not just his willful attitude he doesnt always tell the truth
my son is a liar
he is a boy worf and boys sometimes take the wrong path they need guidance he needs a father his father to give him that guidance i have to leave soon the transport will be leaving for earth you must do what you think is best for him thats all a parent can hope to do

did you enjoy going to school on earth
yes
did you like your teachers
yes
good i understand you lived in my old room
ah ha
good

come in lieutenant worf very nice to see you again and you must be alexander i hear youll be coming to school with us for a while well were very excited to have you with us i know the other boys and girls will be happy to have a new classmate first i need to get a little information from you lets start with your name alexander rozhenko thats a tough one maybe you can help me with that could you spell your last name for me

alexander the teacher asked you a question
it doesnt matter i think i can figure it out date of birth

the forty third day of maktag stardate 
yes yes of course
ill get the rest of his personal records from the school on earth and oh one last question how long will he be staying aboard ship
it has not been decided

come mister worf i thought our meeting was scheduled for eleven hundred hours
i apologise for being late captain i was detained in school i was enrolling my son in class
i see well mister worf as youre aware several new security officers will be transferring to the enterprise next week and i would like to discuss
kyle to lieutenant worf
worf here
im sorry to bother you again lieutenant but i forgot to mention that we need to arrange for a series of placement examinations for alexander if you could tell me when
this is not a good time i will contact you shortly miss kyle sorry captain
i would like to discuss with you the specific areas of ships security that i would like
sickbay to worf
yes doctor
i need to schedule a physical examination for alexander i also need his complete medical records from earth and the medical records of his
i would rather discuss this at a later time
theres no rush crusher out
mister worf you are not the first officer on this ship to have a new family member take care of your son the security matters can wait
thank you captain


twenty three field coils working in concert will generate the soliton wave from this point on the planet surface we will have our test ship towed to a position approximately two million kilometres from bilana three if our theories are correct the wave will envelop the ship and push it into warp
warp without warp drive
theyre going to put you out of a job geordi
i hope so commander
doctor jadar how closely will the enterprise need to follow the test vehicle
the soliton emits a great deal of subspace radio interference youll need to remain within twenty kilometres in order to receive telemetry
doctor how will you end the experiment
the wave will be directed toward lemma two about three light years distance our sister facility there which will generate a scattering field which will dissipate the wave and bring the ship out of warp ill be sending you more detailed operational plans within the hour
very well doctor well contact you again once weve finished studying the mission specs

worf i was just talking with mrs kyle the primary school teacher she told me you enrolled alexander in her class this morning
yes
im sure hell do very well shes a wonderful teacher
good
did she tell you about the fatherson field trip this afternoon
yes we cannot attend
why not
i have a personnel review scheduled at thirteen hundred hours
this would be a good opportunity for you to meet some of the other students and parents
i might be able to reschedule the review
good ill let them know youre coming


as the value of their horns increased the number of white rhinos in the wild kept falling until they finally became extinct about two centuries ago now id like to show you a pair of animals were trying to save from extinction would you follow me theyre from corvan two where their homes in the rainforests are being threatened by industrial pollutants theyre called corvan gilvos theyre a little shy

the eating habits of gilvos are very similar to those of earths draco lizards which died out over three hundred years ago there are only fourteen gilvos left on corvan two were transplanting these two to the protected planet brentalia where they should thrive well why dont you all have a look around on your own for a while if you have any questions please feel free to ask

alexander im sorry i forgot to tell everyone that the models on the tables were for everyone to play with so i guess you didnt know you werent supposed to take them i saw you playing with the lizard model a little while ago do you still have it
are you accusing him of stealing
lieutenant worf i can only tell you that
alexander did you take the model of the lizard from the table
no sir
lieutenant i saw alexander put the model inside of his jacket

lieutenant worf personal log stardate  alexander has acted shamefully and as his father i must now deal with him but i find that i would gladly fight ten armed baldur warriors rather than face one small child

a klingons honour is more important to him than his life a klingon would gladly face the most horrible punishment rather than bring shame or disgrace to his family name his word is his bond without it he is nothing do you understand

why did you lie to me
i dont know
did you fear the punishment you would receive
i dont know
you dont know why you lied and yet you did you dont know why you stole and yet you did alexander come here when i was a child younger than you i lost my parents my family my people everything i had was taken from me except my sense of honour it was the one thing i had which was truly klingon and which no one could take away do you know who they are

kahless
and his brother morath they fought for twelve days and twelve nights because morath had broken his word and brought shame to his family when you lie or steal you not only dishonour yourself but your family you dishonour me
im sorry father i wont do it ever again i promise
i accept your word we will not speak of this matter again

worf
counsellor
i just wanted to know how the field trip went yesterday
you have not heard
no why

bridge there was an incident alexander stole a small model and then told a falsehood but i have remedied the situation
may i ask how
i pointed out his error told him about kahless and morath and explained the value of honour the boy understood
i see sometimes these things arent over as quickly as they seem to be id be happy to help if you have any further problems
thank you that will not be necessary alexander will not repeat this mistake

the prototype has been towed into position captain
initiate a radio link to the ship
link established receiving prelaunch telemetry now
incoming message from doctor jadar
on screen
captain were ready to begin the launch sequence
mister riker
all science labs standing by
course laid in sir
the enterprise is ready doctor
this is doctor jadar to all stations you may begin the launch sequence
and doctor good luck
thank you captain

sensors indicate the field generators on the planet surface are charging captain
the soliton wave has been initiated its heading for the test ship

the test ship has successfully entered warp sir
ensign engage

ensign bring us to within twenty kilometres of the test ship
aye sir
telemetry looks good soliton wave is steady
the test ship is maintaining at warp two point three five sir
thats a little faster than they anticipated but still well within mission parameters
were at twenty kilometres captain
mister data is the wave affecting our warp drive
no sir the effect has been localised to within two kilometres of the wavefront
mister la forge what is the power efficiency of the wave
energy transfer is ninety eight percent
ninety eight
yes sir theres less than a two percent energy loss between the wave and the ship
that is four hundred and fifty percent more efficient than our own warp drive
astonishing commander riker have science lab three begin a series of gamma emission tests
sir the waves power signature is fluctuating
wave efficiency has dropped to seventy three percent
the test ships warp field is becoming unstable sensors show multiple disruptions
im reading a severe subspace distortion sir
it is expanding toward us sir it appears to be interfering with our engines captain
i cant compensate for it
bring us out of warp ensign all stop
aye sir all stop
damage report

hold on
damage report
sensors and warp drive are offline deflectors down to fifteen percent
several injuries reported on deck twenty seven no fatalities
what happened to the test ship
our last readings indicate the craft exploded due to extreme shearing stress
incoming message from bilana three captain
on screen
captain are you all right was anyone hurt
we sustained some minor damage do you know what happened
the preliminary data we received indicate a transient power imbalance
that would be consistent with our telemetry readings from the ship we detected a sudden drop in transfer efficiency just before the explosion
are you still tracking the wave
no the explosion damaged our main sensor array but i think well have it repaired in a couple of hours
well contact you as soon as the sensors are back online
doctor you did it warp without warp drive for a while there it was really something to see
well i hope youre here to see it next time we try mister la forge
so do i doctor

i apologise i was detained
its quite all right please sit down
thank you
lieutenant your son is a very bright very spirited young man from his test scores im sure hell turn out to be one of my best students however from his behaviour in class so far i do have some concerns
what sort of concerns
frankly hes defiant hes overly aggressive toward the other students and he has a great deal of difficulty paying attention
perhaps you do not have experience dealing with klingon children they require a firm hand
and he seems to still have difficulty telling the truth he takes toys from other the other students and then denies taking them he acts like a bully and then says someone else started the fight and hes bluntly told me you said klingons do not listen to teachers
i did not tell him that
no of course not hes acting on his internal feelings and then making up stories to explain them it might be a good idea for the two of you to sit down with counsellor troi and
computer where is alexander rozhenko
alexander rozhenko is on holodeck four
lieutenant i think we should
i will handle this

computer what programme is being run
calisthenics programme of lieutenant worf difficulty level novice


computer freeze programme
did you see it father i won
yes i saw why are you here
im training
but you did not ask permission to take my batleth or permission to use the holodeck
you said you wanted me to be a warrior
i also said i wanted you to obey your teachers and keep your promise to me ms kyle has told me about your behaviour about your lies
i have not lied
alexander do not continue to
shes lying she hates me thats why she makes up stories about me
i will not listen to more lies return to our quarters
you said we could go see the gilvos again
not now not after you have broken your word
you promised you said that we could
enough it is now clear to me that i have failed in my duties as your father you have no understanding about what it means to be klingon i will arrange for you to attend a klingon school there you will learn the lessons i have failed to teach you
no i wont go
would you further dishonour our family with your disobedience
no sir
you will go to our quarters and remain there until i return


riker to engineering whats your estimate on the engines geordi
i need another hour commander i still have to replace three power couplings
understood
sir sensors are coming back online
good begin a sensor sweep for the soliton wave
aye sir the wave is continuing on course for the lemma two colony it is bearing zero two zero mark three two nine
open a channel back here to doctor jadar
sir the wave has increased in velocity to warp four point one
doctor weve located the soliton wave its still on a course for lemma two however its velocity has increased to warp four point one
have you checked the frequency resonance of the subspace
sir the energy level of the wave has increased by a factor of twelve at this rate it will have increased by a factor of two hundred by the time it reaches lemma two
will they still be able to dissipate the wave
commander at that energy level the wave will not only destroy the colony itll take most of the planet with it

are you sure this is what you want
it is not a question of what i want it is a question of what is best for the boy he will be better off at a klingon school
have you discussed this with alexander
he is a child i informed him of my decision
i see
you disapprove
im not here to approve or disapprove of the way you raise your son my concern right now is how this decision is going to affect you how will you feel when alexanders gone
i will be pleased that he is receiving the guidance he requires
is that how you felt when he left to live with your parents
that was different at the time i felt he needed a home a family things i could not provide for him
i understand the idea of raising a child can seem a tremendous burden particularly to a solitary parent
he was no burden i simply knew that a klingon child required more attention than i could provide
i see have you ever wondered how alexander felt about being sent away
he was very young im sure he was confused
do you think he felt abandoned after all he left very soon after kehleyrs death in a way he not only lost his mother he lost his father as well
are you saying that his misconduct is a result of feeling abandoned
its possible children dont have the experience to handle emotional crises instead of dealing with their feelings they act on them tell me about the last time you spoke with kehleyr the night she died
we argued
what about
alexander about how she did not tell me about him when he was born
so you were angry with her
yes
are you still angry with her
of course not
it would be very normal to be angry with her angry because she died and left you alone with a son you never knew you had being angry doesnt mean you loved her any less worf but you cant hide from your feelings just as alexander cannot hide from his you both have a lot of healing to do perhaps you should think about doing it together


alexander
im almost done
stop for a moment let us talk
why
i want you to understand why you are going away
i understand youre ashamed of me
you do not understand im concerned about your future a klingon school will be a better environment for you
you dont care about me
that is not true
all you care about is your honour
alexander if your mother were here i do not think she would want us to fight like this
my mother wouldnt send me away
lieutenant worf please report to the observation lounge
acknowledged remain here i will return shortly


report
the soliton wave has continued to increase in

excuse me
the soliton wave has continued to increase in power its energy level has risen by a factor of ninety six at its current rate of acceleration the wave should hit the planet in a couple of hours
how do we stop it
well there are two possibilities we could attempt to use our own warp engines to generate an inverseresonance wave if we could match the exact frequency and amplitude of the soliton we should be able to neutralise it
you dont sound very confident
because the soliton is constantly changing in both frequency and amplitude it will be extremely difficult to achieve an exact match
lets hear the second option
its a little more dangerous but i think theres a better chance for success we could create a backfire an explosive force set off just in front of the soliton wave a large enough explosion say five photon torpedoes should be enough to disrupt the wave and allow it to dissipate
how fast is the wave travelling now
warp six point three seven
the good news is we can catch it the bad news is that in order to set up this backfire we have to be in front of it
which would require the enterprise to go through the wave
why cant we go around it
the wave has been growing in size as well as power there is insufficient time remaining for us to circumvent it before it reaches lemma two
how much protection will the shields provide if we attempt to penetrate the wave
the shields have not been fully restored shield strength is down to thirty three percent
its going to be quite a ride
its a better choice lay in a course for the soliton wave

ensign after weve passed through the wave i want you to take us at a relative position twenty three kilometres in front of it
aye sir
alert sickbay to prepare for possible casualties
aye sir
the wave has increased speed to warp seven point two captain
ensign take us to warp seven point two one
we are approaching the wave captain distance two hundred kilometres
lets see it

stand by to increase speed to warp seven point three on my mark
red alert load torpedo bays set warhead yields to level sixteen
aye sir
all deck this is the bridge brace for impact
torpedoes loaded
engage



report
we have passed through the wave captain
we have dropped to warp seven point two the wave is directly astern at a distance of twenty three kilometres
deflector strength is down to twelve percent there are fluctuations in several warp transfer conduits tractor beams and transporters offline
we have some gaps in the aft shields captain when the torpedoes explode these areas will be contaminated with ion radiation we need to evacuate sections twenty four to forty seven decks thirty five through thirty eight
make it so
sir there is a fire in biolab four the fire suppression apparatus is not functioning
seal off the compartment prepare to vent the air from
sir there are life forms present in that biolab
were transporting endangered animals from corvan two
readings also indicate the presence of a humanoid captain
computer identify humanoid life form in biolab four
life form is identified as alexander rozhenko
bridge to biolab four alexander can you hear us
sensors show he is alive he may be injured
can we transport him out of there
transporters are still offline
captain warp power is dropping were losing speed
riker to engineering geordi what is going on

we lost four warp transfer conduits commander
the wave is gaining on us

we need more speed
i doubt that i can keep this speed up

much longer commander youd better fire those torpedoes while were still in front of the wave

mister data how long before the wave overtakes us
at our current speed four minutes thirty seconds sir
captain permission to leave the bridge
granted commander will you accompany mister worf to biolab four
captain biolab four is one of the areas that will be flooded with ion radiation
commander i cant let the soliton wave hit the colony you have three minutes not one second more

primary controls shorted out

stand clear



alexander
alexander can you hear me alexander

the soliton wave has closed to ten kilometres captain
stand by to fire torpedoes on my command

alexander
commander ive found him

worf where are you worf
over here help me

its too heavy ive got to find something to help us
father
lie still i am here
my leg hurts im scared

the gilvos
theres no time
please theyll die

the wave has closed to one kilometre captain
picard to commander riker bridge to lieutenant worf acknowledge
the wave is about to overtake us sir
commander riker acknowledge fire torpedoes



the wave has been disrupted sir
picard to riker
riker here captain we made it

sir the boys going to be all right

youre a very lucky little boy just some minor smoke inhalation and a hairline fracture of the tibia thats a bone in your leg id like to keep him overnight but he should be fine by tomorrow
thank you doctor

are you going to get in trouble because of me
do not concern yourself with that
am i in trouble
yes but we will discuss that at a later time
im sorry i promise ill be good at the klingon school ill make you proud of me
klingon schools are designed to be difficult the physical and mental hardships faced by the students are meant to build character and strength however if you wish to face a greater challenge you may stay here with me it will not be easy for either one of us but perhaps we can face the challenge together
i accept your challenge father i will stay
i believe your mother would be pleased
hero worship

captains log stardate  two days ago starbase five one four lost contact with the research vessel vico which was sent to explore the interior of a black cluster we are en route to investigate

captain we are entering sector nine seven
i am picking up massive gravitational fluctuations sir
take us out of warp ensign
yes sir
the black cluster is within visual range captain

aye captain

lets find that ship full sensor sweep mister data
aye sir
what a sight
one of the most ancient formations in the galaxy
i have located the vico sir the vessel appears to be adrift
lets see it life signs
nothing commander
damage report mister data
outer and inner hulls have been breached decks seven through twelve are exposed to space
set up a translink to their computer core lets see what happened
i cannot sir the emergency bulkheads on that deck are in place our linkup signal cannot penetrate them
structural status commander
stress readings indicate considerable pressure on the transverse supports
is it stable enough for an away team
yes sir but the risk of structural collapse is quite high
have transporter room one maintain a lock on each member of your away team i want you out of there at the first sign of trouble
take us to fifteen thousand metres ensign
yes sir
data youre with me


this station is inoperable sir
this one seems to be stuck in a feedback loop
lets see if we can tap directly into the computer core
the odn junction is right down here

data

core transfer is engaged

exchange protocol verified the files are intact at least some of them anyway

stay here geordi data

are my parents alright
captains log supplemental a young boy shielded from our initial sensor scans has been discovered pinned beneath a fallen beam the degree of damage to the vico is making our rescue attempt difficult

transporter room one can you lock on

to him and transport directly to sickbay
ill try captain but theres a lot of shielding to pull him through

acknowledged picard to crusher

sickbay here captain
prepare for emergency transport
yes sir

crusher out
picard to commander riker

is the boy ready number one
ready sir
its your signal
aye captain its going to be okay here we go energise

ensign do we have him
the lock is holding i just cant resolve the matter stream not with all that victurium alloy in the way

commander riker youll have to get him out into the corridor
i could move the beam sir however it may initiate the collapse of the surrounding supports i recommend you and geordi return to the ship
agreed la forge


im locked onto commander data and the boy sir ill energise as soon as theyve cleared the bulkheads
whenever youre ready data
yes sir

are youre going to lift that
yes then i will take you to the corridor we will transport back to the enterprise from there do you understand
how come you can pick up something so heavy
i am an android my strength is many times that of a human it is going to be okay i will count to three one two three

energise
captains log supplemental a thorough search of the vico has revealed no additional survivors we have begun the process of counselling the boy with regard to the tragedy

dont be afraid

we were in the black cluster i dont know where they came from they had a big ship and they kept shooting at us then they beamed over they had purple helmets on and phaser rifles i saw them they didnt see me
youre safe now timothy im sorry for what happened its going to be all right i bet youre hungry would you like me to get you something to eat

counsellor i must join commander la forge in engineering if you will excuse me

timothy would you like data to stay with you a little bit longer 


sections of the primary and secondary hull were torn right off the shearing planes are here here and here
how much longer till we can access their logs
almost an hour
the boy was here
the hallway outside the computer core his mother was the ships systems engineer the second away team found her body here inside the core
and his father
ships second officer he was most likely on the bridge when it was exposed to space
most likely


hell sleep for a few hours at least i dont need to keep him here but i will need to see him again tomorrow youve got some work cut out for you
his world is gone data were going to have to help him build a new one

this is not good whatever hit the vico must have set up an em pulse that flashed through their computer banks
nearly eighty three percent of their records have been lost
and all of their sensor logs lets use what we got from our own sensors ill call up the structural analysis and the surface scans
geordi as a child did you ever experience a traumatic event
youre wondering about timothy
yes
i was caught in a fire once i must have been i dont know about five i guess it was before i got the first visor and it was only a couple of minutes before my parents found me and pulled me out and nobody got hurt but i tell you that was the longest couple of minutes of my life it was a while after that before i could even let my parents get out of earshot it was like i absolutely needed to know that they were there you know
timothy no longer has that kind of support
yeah


dara and her brother found themselves in the land of tagas where the ruler elamos the magnificent had proclaimed as law no children will be tolerated within the great kingdom when dara saw the proclamation she just laughed and said how magnificent a ruler to be frightened by the likes of us timothy were done with sculpture for now
its not finished

well come back to it next period why dont you pick up your mythology book and follow along
but its not finished



magnetic residual analysis confirms that the vico was attacked inside the black cluster the graviton wave fronts pushed the ship to where we found it
no signs of phaser burns on the hull
no sir torsional stress levels point to a disrupterstyle weapon
fracture points indicate that the energy burst came from a range of less than three thousand metres
but thats a strategy consistent with a cloaked vessel romulan or klingon but were quite a distance from either of their territories
the breen have outposts in this sector the attack on the vico is consistent with their battle tactics and their level of technology
thank you data but what would the breen be doing inside the black cluster the boy described a boarding party with helmets and phaser rifles
boarding party i dont think thats likely sir

counsellor
there was absolutely no evidence of anybody coming on board the vico we would have found a transporter field trace or if somebody had used the entry ports we would have found an electrostatic differential in the docking latches and we didnt could timothy have imagined that counsellor
or could he be lying
if hes lying i havent been able to sense it perhaps his emotional trauma level is too high
why wouldnt he tell us the truth
hes still in shock its hard to know whats going on in his mind right now
well ill go back and check the sensor readings again but i dont think were going to find anything
thank you geordi

data captain i think we should ask data to spend some time with him
i do not understand
im very worried about his behaviour and what ive just heard doesnt make me feel any better data youre the only one hes reached out to because you rescued him we can use your relationship with him to help his recovery
would timothy also be more inclined to tell data the truth about what happened
its a possibility
commander proceed with timothy as the counsellor suggests
aye sir

counsellor exactly how shall i proceed
just be with him youre a presence he trusts and thats what he needs most right now


what

data
hello timothy may i enter
yeah
ah you are attempting to recreate the dokkaran temple of kural hanesh
isnt it great see theres the big hallway the teacher told us about thats where everybody came in thats where they stood and thats where the altar was what do you think
do you wish a frank evaluation  it lacks the harmony that characterised this particular temple and dokkaran culture in general

you hate it
no i am not capable of hatred
i cant do anything right
you are making an unwarranted extrapolation i was merely offering an aesthetic analysis of this particular model the base appears quite sturdy

i told you
may i suggest a different approach you were attempting to construct the upper level before the supports were in place observe
la forge to data
data here
i need your help with the shield modulators
i will join you in a moment geordi data out lieutenant la forge requires my assistance

incredible data how come you can do that
i am designed to exceed human capacity both mentally and physically
androids are better than humans
better is a highly subjective term i do not for example possess the ability to experience emotion as humans do
no emotions you mean you cant be happy or sad
that is correct
why not
my positronic brain is not capable of generating those conditions goodbye

data can we build something else later
that would be acceptable
bye


i am designed to exceed human capacity tilts head that is correct

the black cluster was formed almost nine billion years ago when hundreds of protostars collapsed in close proximity the resulting gravitational forces are both violent and highly unpredictable
to get anywhere near the centre were going to have to push through the gravitational wavefronts like the science vessel was designed to do ive already adjusted our shields accordingly
the gravitational forces will affect sensor accuracy detecting an enemy vessel will be difficult
maybe thats what happened to the vico they didnt see anything coming until it was too late
counsellor has the boy volunteered any further information
no but i do have an appointment with him in less than half an hour
if theres a possibility of getting more from him id like you to pursue it but we need to continue our investigation well enter the black cluster at oh seven hundred hours tomorrow morning dismissed


hello timothy are you ready to go
yes counsellor i am ready
how are you feeling
i am functioning within established parameters
established parameters you sound like data
i am an android
i see well lets go for our walk shall we
that would be acceptable

so what would you like
androids do not need to eat or drink  however sometimes we like to taste things a tamarin frost please would you like anything counsellor
no im fine thank you
as you wish
so youre no longer a human
im an android
when did this happen
ive always been an android
whats it like being an android
i am designed to exceed human capacity both mentally and physically but i do not experience emotions
you dont no emotion at all
that is correct


an android
i know it sounds unusual but it is understandable technically its called enantiodromia conversion into the opposite timothy went from human to machine from being emotional to being emotionless but the underlying trauma is still there hes just found a new way to suppress it
counsellor how long will this behaviour last
as long as he needs it to timothy is rebuilding his identity as best he can the android persona is just one step along the way as soon as he feels stronger and more sure of himself it should drop away naturally
i assume this is not a time to confront him about what happened to his ship
not yet the best thing we can do right now is to let timothy take us where he wants to go we should support the process and even encourage it
data i would like you to make timothy the best android he can possibly be


timothy your head movements are counterproductive can you be still
but you do it
the servo mechanisms in my neck are designed to approximate human movements i did not realize the effect was so distracting
i like it data are there any other androids in starfleet
no i am the only one
how come youre not captain
my service experience does not yet warrant such a position
data whats the scariest thing that ever happened to you
fear is a quality that i do not possess
because its an emotion
correct
but what if you had a nightmare
i have never had a nightmare i do not require sleep timothy are you having disturbing dreams
i do not require sleep
is that satisfactory 
its perfect

transfer circuits are functioning properly
within established parameters
absolutely input processing pattern recognition all within established parameters
thank you doctor


i ran out of red ochre
you may use mine
thank you 
perhaps you should return to your quarters
im fine the servo mechanisms in my mouth are designed to approximate human movements

that is not bad
thank you  it is very expressive
thank you
is your painting representative of something
its just a painting
timothy you understand that you may speak with me about anything you wish any subject
i understand
at times i too find it difficult to share my thoughts with others i am not always confident that i am expressing myself in a manner which humans can comprehend but do i know that


we are approaching the perimeter im picking up the gravitational wavefronts
engage forward shields thirty five percent
shields up

drop to one quarter impulse ensign
yes sir
bridge to engineering

adjusting shield frequencies now commander well have this smoothed out in just a second

ensign adjust course for any deviations
yes sir
resume one third impulse
captain i am reading something at four hundred thousand kilometres off the starboard bow possibly a ship
red alert
take us to visual range ensign
adjusting course
sensor readings have disappeared wait i am picking up another reading at four hundred thousand kilometres off the port bow its gone no it is back to starboard
captain the black cluster is distorting the sensors were picking up echoes of the enterprise reflecting off the wavefronts
cancel red alert mister worf adjust the sensors to compensate for the distortion
aye
sensor difficulties have been reported by ships travelling through black clusters but never this extreme
captain that formation is seven times more massive than any explored previously that could explain the difference
resume previous course ensign
yes sir


he laughed
yes its nice to see isnt it
it is certainly not consistent with his android persona
id say hes beginning the process of letting go of that fantasy
then my work with him is done
no i dont think it is data a laugh is one step in the right direction we need to help him take a few more steps
how counsellor
id like you to talk to him about your own fascination with humanity if you can explain to timothy the appeal that humanity has for you he might find it easier to become a boy again


this is great how is yours
the complex polysaccharides in reaction with the carbon dioxide produces an unusual combination of texture and effervescence
but how does it taste is it good
i am not capable of tasting in the manner you suggest however i can analyse the composition of a dessert and make comparative conclusions about its possible effect on the human palate but i neither like it nor dislike it
oh i didnt realise that
i have often wondered what it must be like to have ones mouth water in anticipation of the arrival of a confection or to feel the pleasure i have observed in humans as they consume it
you sound like you dont want to be an android
i am an android that will never change
but if you could change would you
i have often wished to be human i study people carefully in order to more closely approximate human behaviour
why were stronger and smarter than humans we can do more than they can
but i cannot take pride in my abilities i cannot take pleasure in my accomplishments
but we never have to feel bad either
i would gladly risk feeling bad at times if it also meant that i could also taste my dessert

captain gravitational wavefront intensity is increasing steadily eleven hundred standard g units and rising
lets see if anyones out there mister worf attempt a wide range sensor sweep
aye sir gravitational distortion is too great captain the scanning signal is again being reflected off the wavefronts i am unable to compensate the sensors are useless
mister data to the bridge please
acknowledged
adjust sensors to short range attempt a limited positron scan
the distortion is still in effect
better jacket the scanning beam
the secondary beam is being distorted as well

mister data our sensors have been rendered ineffective by the field distortion i want your analysis mister worf fire phasers maximum intensity limited spectrum zero zero one mark zero four five
an experiment captain
exactly number one
firing phasers

explanation mister data
phaser energy was reflected by the gravitational wavefronts it is similar to the phenomenon distorting our sensor signals
phasers and sensors both useless mister data this reflection phenomenon would it have the same effect on a disruptorstyle weapon
yes sir disruptors would be ineffectual
and a ships cloaking field
it would be extremely difficult to maintain
mister data is it at all likely that the vico could have been attacked inside the cluster
given the effects we have observed the probability is exceedingly remote sir
picard to counsellor troi
yes captain
counsellor will you bring timothy to my ready room

timothy can you tell us what happened to your ship
i did tell you
tell us again
we were attacked
that is highly unlikely our investigations have clearly demonstrated
we were attacked we were attacked
timothy androids do not lie
it was me
please explain
it was me i did it i killed them all everything was shaking i lost my balance i was just trying to hold on to something i didnt mean to do it
what was it that didnt you mean to do timothy
my arm hit the computer panel thats what destroyed the ship
the ship was damaged when your arm hit the computer panel timothy listen to me the damage to your ship might have occurred at the same time your arm touched the panel but it was only a coincidence this wasnt your fault
yes it was
it is not possible the onboard control systems for every starship require a user code clearance you could not have inadvertently affected any of the vicos systems
your computer had safety precautions there is nothing you could have touched that would have damaged your ship
youre not responsible for what happened to your parents timothy
but if it wasnt me
were trying to determine what happened right now and if there is anything you can remember that may assist

thats just how it was when it started on the vico

wavefront intensity has increased
increase shields to seventy five percent
aye sir

damage mister worf
minimal sir shields are holding

ensign full about go to warp two
the gravitational distortion is too high we cant maintain a warp field
full shields
aye
captain impulse power has been disrupted the helm wont respond
we couldnt get out either
timothy perhaps you and i should go below and get out of everyones way
no
riker to la forge can you give me more power to the shields
stand by
thats what they kept saying more shields more shields
timothy accompany me please  i want you to recall everything you heard people say aboard the vico before it was destroyed
i dont know just that just more shields
captain ive transferred

fusion reactors four through nine into the shield array that should double the shield strength

wavefront intensity has increased by an order of magnitude impact in three two one

wave front intensity is continuing to increase structural overpressure now exceeding one hundred eighty percent
la forge
i dont understand that should have been enough

we could run the shield grid directly off the warp drive

go ahead commander
initiating warptransfer pathways now
diverting warp power to the shields
warp power to the shields they said that too data im positive
wavefront intensity has increased by a factor of ten contact in thirty one seconds without additional power to the shields the outer hull will not hold
la forge

warp transfer to the shields complete

thats as strong as theyre going to get
impact in fifteen seconds

sir drop the shields
thats suicide data
captain drop the shields
make it so
aye

our own shields caused the increases in the wavefronts sir we have been experiencing a harmonic amplification effect
the more energy we dumped into the shield grid the worse the impact
precisely that is also what destroyed the vico when timothy remembered similar procedures on his ship i initiated an analysis of shield output to wavefront amplitude and discovered a correlation
if we had transferred all that warp power to the shields it would have torn the ship apart
status ensign
navigation is coming back online
full about one quarter impulse take us out of here


timothys a boy feeling a great deal of pain but he is a boy again is this difficult for you data
difficult
to watch him moving away from being like you
that would require an emotional context which i cannot provide

okay everybody lets go come on

hello timothy
hi data how are you
i am operating within established parameters how are you
i miss my parents but im okay i guess you thought i was pretty silly when i had my hair like yours and everything
i have been told that imitation is the highest form of flattery
can we still do things together even if im not really an android
i have many human friends i would be pleased to count you among them
that would be acceptable
violations

captains log stardate  while on a mapping survey we are conveying a delegation of ullians to kaldra four these telepathic historians conduct their research by retrieving longforgotten memories

its a chipped cup offwhite with a crack in it i can see it but i dont remember anything else about it
 when you see it do you hear any sounds
no i dont think so wait yes humming someones humming
a woman
yes but i dont know who it is
try to touch the cup
it has a sharp edge where its chipped
is there anything inside the cup
a liquid dark
like tea

its not hot its bitter
theres something else inside the cup
yes a wooden handle
a spoon
no its more delicate than that
reach out for it
a brush an ink brush i hear that humming again
keep listening to it and hold out the brush see if anyone takes it from you
its obaachan my grandmother shes doing ink brush writing i can remember it now she used that cup for cleaning the brushes and it was my job to fill it with water and bring it to the table i would sit beside her and watch the most beautiful characters come from that brush and the whole time shed be humming to herself i remember it like it was yesterday
that is remarkable you remembered such vivid detail
for years ive seen that old cup in my memory but i could never remember what it was or why it was important thank you
youre entirely welcome young lady perhaps someone else would care to try  you madam youre thinking of that first childhood kiss would you like to remember more about it
father you know youre not supposed to probe someones memory unless theyve given you permission
you are right but sometimes with a beautiful woman i can not help myself
how about you commander got any memories you feel like digging up
none that id care to share with an audience
its getting late id better be going


it is perplexing to me that the ullians ability to retrieve memory is so highly prized if an event were important enough to be recovered why would it have been forgotten
its not quite the same for us as it is for you data you record every second of every moment of your life
that is correct
and then if you want to recall any one of those moments you just access the proper memory circuit
my understanding of the human brain suggests that the process is the same for you each memory is encoded in chains of molecules if you want to retrieve it you simply access the proper rna sequence
yeah thats true
then in what way is it different
sometimes there are memories we just cant access at the spur of the moment for instance i have no recollection of how i spent my last birthday birthdays are important occasions and you would think that id remember how i spent the day but right now i cant even remember where i was

deck two on the other hand i remember everything about the time i got my first pet a circassian cat i was eight i remember how funnylooking he was i remember how excited i was its as if it happened last week
perhaps you remember the pleasant memories and forget the unpleasant ones
no sometimes the bad memories can be the most intense of all
it would seem there is no predictable pattern to human memory
it would seem

this library of ours has been in the planning stages for years a collection of the retrieved memories of races from many different star systems
what my son means to say is we think of ourselves as archaeologists of the mind we believe that the history of a world is contained in the personal experience of its people
rather like the ancient oral historians on earth
exactly the library we propose will be a vast storehouse of these individual memories
that sounds like quite a project how long will it take to finish your studies on kaldra
 many months weve been working for years and weve surveyed only eleven planets in eight star systems
but its our way of life we wouldnt want to do anything else
captain mister tarmin gave us a demonstration of his abilities this afternoon its fascinating perhaps you would like to resurrect some memories
id be happy to probe your recollections captain most people find it an enjoyable experience
im sure however i dont think i would make a particularly good subject
im sure youd be ideal and you must have some intriguing memories
we wont be on your ship for long this may be your last chance
yes well
tarmin we mustnt influence people we must let them come to us willingly
i have found over the years there are many who want the experience of memory retrieval but who lack some encouragement in order to come forward
you mister worf i would love to explore klingon memories
klingons do not allow themselves to be probed
but there is nothing to fear
father
i am not fearful
commander la forge you
i dont think so thanks anyway
i have rarely encountered such squeamish people doctor crusher commander riker
mister tarmin are all ullians able to read memories
oh no my dear the technique requires special training it is a serious commitment
it takes years of study tarmin is the most proficient of our group
once jev spent two days with a contingent of elderly gentons he couldnt get anything from them i spent only one hour with them and retrieved a fragment from the gentonian trade wars
excuse me

exactly how long will it be before we reach kaldra captain
mister data
four days eleven hours

jev
im sorry im being rude
no not at all
my father finds it amusing to demean me in public i reach the point where i dont want to hear any more
its not easy having an overbearing parent believe me i know how you feel
oh thats right youre an empath
oh i cant read ullians but i do know a certain betazoid mother who is a great deal like your father

deck eight
deck sixteen
ive learned to remind myself that my mother and i are two separate individuals
and have you enjoyed much success with this approach counsellor
no but i do keep reminding myself

goodnight
goodnight counsellor and thank you


have you stopped thinking about us
hot chocolate

imzadi we cant not when were serving on the same ship
have you stopped thinking about us just answer that i cant stop thinking about you
will dont
imzadi we cant not when were serving on the same ship
have you stopped thinking about us
we mustnt do this will dont will no

imzadi have you stopped thinking about us just answer that
no no no dont
i cant stop thinking about you imzadi have you stopped thinking about us
no

captains log stardate  counsellor troi has fallen into a deep coma after a thorough examination doctor crusher has been unable to find signs of illness or infection

any change doctor martin
no im still getting unusual neurotransmitter readings in the diencephalon but they might be a result of the coma
can you bring her out of it
ive tried standard revival techniques she doesnt respond until i find out whats caused this i dont want to try anything more extreme
do we know what she was doing when this happened
no she was found in her quarters this morning when she didnt show up for an appointment she was dressed for bed but the bed hadnt been slept in
who was the last person to speak with her
she left the dinner last night with one of the ullians ill talk to him
ask if they would consent to an examination just to be certain
ill check the biofilter readings from the ullian transporter log its possible they could still be carrying a harmful organism

may i join you
commander of course somethings wrong
counsellor trois ill
im sorry to hear it
shes more than ill shes in a coma doctor crusher doesnt know whats causing it or how to treat her
when did this happen
apparently some time last night thats why i wanted to talk to you you may have been the last person to see her did you go with her into her quarters
are you suggesting that i behaved improperly commander
not at all im just trying to trace her steps
we talked in a turbolift briefly she got out at deck eight i did not go with her
jev im not accusing you of anything did she mention feeling ill
she seemed fine she has a wonderful sense of humour
if you have no objections doctor crusher would like to examine you and your group
to what end
shes just trying to eliminate the possibility that one of you might be carrying an organism that was harmful to deanna im not implying that you did anything intentional im just trying to get to the bottom of the mystery
we have nothing to hide if you wish to spend time examining us
fine thank you

deanna i dont know if you can hear me ive heard doctors say that even when someones in a coma they may be able to hear when people talk to them that it might help stimulate the brain speed the healing in fact i think you did that for me once when i was in pretty bad shape i just thought it might help to hear a friendly voice even if you dont know youre hearing it weve been busy mapping the sector its been pretty routine the most unusual thing weve seen is a binary star system lets see what else i finished the personnel review that we were working on you can check it out when you wake up i miss you please dont stay away too long
will will i promise ill let you know the minute that she regains consciousness
i know
theres nothing you can do here youll wear yourself out
right
its late go to bed thats an order

bridge to commander riker picard to commander riker answer please computer locate commander riker
commander riker is in his quarters
on my way sir


medical log stardate  commander riker is the second officer who has fallen into an unexplained coma i have examined the ullians and ruled out the possibility that they carry a harmful organism

i compared deannas brain scan to one that i took during her last physical there is a difference this time theres a trace of electropathic activity
and commander riker
i found the same pattern if i didnt know better id say they both had iresine syndrome thats the only medical condition that would produce that pattern
what is iresine syndrome
a very rare neurological disorder first diagnosed in the twenty third century its characterised by an identical electropathic residue
why discount the possibility that its responsible for these comas
iresine is always accompanied by a severely decreased histamine count both will and deanna showed normal levels ive asked commander la forge to conduct a shipwide diagnostic to determine any other agent that might cause the same electropathic pattern
commander riker and counsellor troi were in perfect health until the ullians arrived it would be wise to quarantine the aliens
i believe that it would be premature to take that action mister worf theres no real evidence linking these comas with the ullians
thats true but there is something curious the electropathic residue i discovered is located in the thalamus thats the area of the cerebral cortex that involves memory function

ive been accused of putting people to sleep with one too many stories captain but this is the first time its ever been suggested that i might be the cause of someones coma
i mean no disrespect but we are faced with an alarming situation
why do you suspect us captain
suspect is perhaps too strong a word im simply trying to determine what has caused two of my officers to fall into comas
but youve already examined us we arent carrying anything harmful
in further study of the victims i detected some abnormal patterns in the area of the brain that involves memory
in light of your telepathic abilities it raises the question
captain it is not our wish to obstruct you what would you like
if i could do further examinations tomorrow perhaps monitor you during a memory probe
scrutiny does not frighten us
we will be happy to cooperate doctor
thank you ill contact you in the morning

youre the only person on board to undergo a memory probe by the ullians id like to do a neurological work up and see if i can detect any residual effect doctor martin will monitor your vital signs while i conduct the scan
im happy to help
have you had any unusual symptoms since the probe headaches dizziness
no nothing like that it was a wonderful experience
electrical activity is normal cpk levels are normal hippocampus is stable and the thalamus the thalamus is normal there is no indication at all of the electropathic residual
is that good
oh youre fine keiko but i am no closer to solving this mystery

computer locate the electropathic pattern described in medical database four delta one
electropathic pattern located
okay were going to track down any possible cause of that brain pattern first what are the medical conditions that might account for it
iresine syndrome is a cause of the electropathic pattern
right and doctor crusher already eliminated that so how many nonmedical forces or substances might cause the pattern
there are twenty two nonmedical agents
okay and how many of those are present on the enterprise
none are present on the enterprise
are the ships sensors calibrated to detect all those agents
all agents are scanned by the sensors
okay lets start with the chemical substances name them
ferrazene hylanatine dardilion chrysimite and manzene
ferrazene has a complex molecular structure it breaks down into bilenium and tarrisite do the sensors scan for those
ships sensors scan for both compounds
and are they present on the enterprise
bilenium and tarrisite are not present
do any of the substances break down into byproducts that are not scanned for
dardilion contains the byproduct nilizene sensors do not routinely scan for that substance
well this isnt a routine situation scan for the nilizene
there is no nilizene on the enterprise
how did i know you were going to say that okay lets move on to the nonchemical agents

anything more i can do for you
no thanks i was just doing some reading on the iresine syndrome if a new strain has developed that might explain the normal histamine count
any luck
not so far
okay ill see you tomorrow

you shouldnt remember him like this

you dont have to do this
its important to me i have to see him to see him to see him to see him

its good of you to come
its the least i can do

you shouldnt remember him like this
i have to face the fact that hes gone
you shouldnt remember him like this
its good of you to come with me
its the least i can do
you shouldnt remember him like this
its the least i can do


ive spent two hours having a cozy chat with the computer ive checked everything i can think of any possible agent that might cause that electropathic pattern
i assume from your tone of voice that you were unsuccessful
didnt find a thing

doctor crushers not going to be too happy with


emergency medical team to doctor crushers office immediately

doctor crusher had me working on a shipwide diagnostic id gone to give her the results when i found her
did your scans provide any insights into these comas
none ive checked and crosschecked theyre just dead ends
we seem to have eliminated the all known factors that may have caused the comas except for the ullians
mister data i want you to investigate those eleven planets that the ullians visited see if there were any reports of unexplained comas
aye sir
in the meantime we must consider restricting them to their quarters as a precautionary measure
if one of them is behind this will keeping telepaths in their quarters prevent it from happening again
what else can we do station a guard set up a force field i dont see that those would be any more effective
sickbay to captain picard
picard here
counsellor troi has regained consciousness shes asked for you sir
im on my way

its like waking up from a nightmare and not remembering what it was about
what is the last thing you do remember
my hair i was brushing my hair
and then
i dont know just waking up here why do i feel so frightened what happened to me
we were hoping that you could tell us
how long have i been here
three days
three days
you were the first the next day commander riker fell into a similar coma last night doctor crusher
what is going on here
were not certain it may be that there is some unusual effect produced by the ullians telepathic activity im going to talk to them and in the meantime youre to stay here and recuperate and if you remember anything at all about what happened i want you to tell me immediately

what are you suggesting captain
that you voluntarily confine yourself to your quarters at least until we have unraveled this mystery
were to be prisoners
father
no please dont look on it like that we have done everything we can to explain these comas we have performed physical examinations and neurological scans we have conducted a shipwide diagnostic looking for viruses parasites infestations we have investigated every possible cause we can imagine we have found nothing nothing to explain these comas the only variable that we have not been able to eliminate is your presence here on this ship now in the light of our actions we would ask you to understand my request and to agree to it
captain our history indicates that we do not adversely affect the people we contact
i know that
then are you implying an intentional assault
im simply considering all possibilities
surely you would give us the chance to prove that we are innocent
if thats possible of course
then i would propose doing a memory probe of counsellor troi you have said that she doesnt remember anything that happened before she lapsed into unconsciousness i could retrieve that memory there is a possibility that it could explain the coma and prove our innocence
im sorry i couldnt possibly subject counsellor troi to a potentially dangerous procedure
and i refuse to be a party to any of these proceedings

jev is making a reasonable request captain if were to be accused surely were entitled to a defence tarmin did a memory probe on another of your crew has she suffered any ill effects
no
and neither will counsellor troi please you may have as many people here as you need to guarantee her safety but give us this chance to vindicate ourselves
i will discuss the matter with counsellor troi


well thats it for melina two no unexplained comas during the time the ullians were working there
we have yet to receive transmissions from the two planets of the nel system perhaps they will show different results
maybe or maybe were not checking for the right thing
please clarify
we havent look into the comas that were explained
why would we do that
well remember what doctor crusher said right after counsellor troi became unconscious that it looked exactly like iresine syndrome except for the histamine count
yes
maybe not every medical facility is as careful as doctor crusher maybe its easier to just make a quick diagnosis rather than to keep hunting for the real cause
you are searching for instances of iresine syndrome
right and correlating them with visits by the ullians and there we are
two cases of iresine syndrome on hurada three at exactly the time tarmin and his group was there
lets check the other planets i think we may have something here


counsellor i want to reiterate if you have any doubts whatsoever about this procedure you dont have to go through with it
i want to do it captain something awful happened to me and i dont even know what it was
very well
counsellor whats the last thing you remember the other night
brushing my hair
would you get your hairbrush
tell me about brushing your hair do you do it every night
yes when im ready for bed
what is it
someone touching my hair
someones with you in the room
no no im alone theres no one there
go on
i get some hot chocolate
somethings happening
im alone in my quarters im remembering something from a few years ago
go back into that memory you said someone was touching your hair
yes and

its will riker thats right i was thinking of him
remembering a time when you were with him
yes after a poker game
its a pleasant memory stay with it
now hes hurting me no
youre frightened
i want him to stop its not will somebodys taken his place
someone else is there who is it
no he shouldnt be here why is he here stop youre hurting me
can you see his face
yes
imzadi
no stop youre hurting me
who is it whos doing this to you
its tarmin its your father
captains log stardate  we have set a course for starbase four forty where the ullians will disembark and return home

inad and i have contacted our home planet if you want to prosecute my father the authorities there will support you
im not sure we have any legal basis for such a prosecution memory invasion is simply not a crime weve ever had to contend with
according to what ive just learned its a practice that was abolished on our world centuries ago
what could motivate someone like your father to commit such an act
i dont know a perverse source of pleasure perhaps a way to exercise control over another
your father claims quite strenuously that he is innocent
my father has never been one to admit that hes wrong but it is difficult to believe hed be capable of this i am told that the punishment for this crime is quite severe we are monitoring my fathers telepathic activities you have my assurance he wont assault anyone else i am sorry for this captain

picard to commander data
yes captain
hows your search coming

we have uncovered several cases sir but we have not yet completed our investigation

well inform the medical personnel on those planets that we have discovered the true nature of the comas im sure theyll appreciate knowing what

really happened
yes sir we will keep searching sir
we just got the transmission from the nel system data no mention of iresine syndrome but there are two unexplained comas on one planet none on the other
and were the ullians present
checking the mission logs thats funny on stardates  and  when the comas occurred tarmin was on his home planet he wasnt anywhere near the nel system

come in

hello jev
well be reaching starbase soon i wanted to say goodbye and to apologise again for my father
theres no need youre not responsible for what he did
before all this happened i had hoped we might become friends
we still can
after what hes put you through maybe you can forget im not sure i can youre so lovely i have to go goodbye
jev youre upset would you like to talk
no
youd feel better if you did
why do you have to be so nice so lovely

what whats happening its happening again
youre so beautiful so fragile
it was you it was always you
 have you stopped thinking about us
no

dont dont i wont let you

no no

counsellor are you all right
yes

why are you here how did you know
we discovered two instances of unexplained coma on nel three while the ullians were there but tarmin was not part of the group further examination revealed that only one ullian was present at all incidents of coma jev
captains log stardate  doctor crusher and commander riker regained consciousness while we were en route to the ullian home world the slow process of their recovery has begun

i have asked that the finest physicians on my world meet with you all upon our return to help you in your healing process
they have been in contact with us already thank you
it has been three centuries since anyone was treated for this this form of rape but there are medical records from that era it was a time of great violence among my people a time we thought we had put far behind us that this could happen now its unimaginable
earth was once a violent planet too at times the chaos threatened the very fabric of life but like you we evolved we found to find better ways to handle our conflicts but i think no one can deny that the seed of violence remains within each of us we must recognise that because that violence is capable of consuming each of us as it consumed your son
the masterpiece society

captains log stardate  the enterprise has been diverted to the moab sector to track a stellar core fragment of a disintegrated neutron star our science teams have been asked to monitor the planetary disruptions it may cause

weve got a problem our core fragment is going to pass by moab four in six days
isnt that exactly what we anticipated
we didnt anticipate that somebody would be living there
an artificial environment has been constructed on the southern continent sir
have you definitely established that theres someones inside it
yes captain sensors are reading human life forms
human
are they responding to our hails mister worf
negative sir
any starships ever reported missing in this sector mister data
no sir
how the hell did they find themselves on a deserted planet
im pretty sure they know were here
mister la forge
our sensors are picking up deep em readings looks like wave patterns from an obsolete subspace relay
which would suggest they also have the ability to communicate with us
mister worf open the lower band frequencies most commonly used in the last century
channel open
this is captain jeanluc picard of the federation starship enterprise it is urgent that you respond
sir defensive shield around the structure is increasing in strength
not exactly a welcome mat
we mean you no harm we must warn you that your planet is about to experience massive seismic disruptions due to an approaching stellar core fragment no structure will be able to withstand them
they are responding
on screen
 enterprise i am aaron conor
mister conor we were unaware that there were human colonies in this system
i dont want to be rude captain but we dont wish to interact with outsiders im only responding because of your warning
the fragment will have serious effects on your planet within six days
yes i know we have been tracking it but our biosphere has been constructed to withstand quakes of eight point seven on the richter scale
mister data
the fragment has a density of one hundred billion kilograms per cubic centimetre as a result when it passes moab four it will cause tectonic shifts well beyond eight point seven on the richter scale
im afraid were going to have to evacuate your people
evacuate that is not possible there must be an alternative
well we will gladly explore the possibility of it with you mister conor would you like to come aboard to discuss it
our environment is sealed no one can get in or out
we are capable of matterenergy transport
matterenergy
we can take you directly through the structure
really thats quite remarkable
may we arrange for your transport
no i must stay here but under the circumstances i will permit a small delegation from your ship inside the biosphere if only to see this matterenergy transportation you speak of
very good commander riker and an away team will join you shortly picard out

 this is a mistake aaron
good lord martin what would you have me do
anything that would keep them out of here
we have nothing to hide
we have a great deal to lose

what is that
its them look at this martin


its lovely i can understand why you are reluctant to leave mister conor
not just reluctant miss troi it is imperative that we remain
it would be suicide to evacuate it would destroy everything weve worked for two centuries to accomplish
you see this is an engineered society
engineered
genetically engineered our ancestors came from earth to develop a perfect society they believed that through controlled procreation they could create people without flaws and those people would build a paradise
all of you have been selectively bred your dna patterns chosen
eight generations of us
we have immeasurably extended the potential of humanity physically psychologically we have evolved beyond beyond
beyond us
frankly yes no one in this society would be blind for example no offence intended
i can see you just fine sir
yes well my point was just
thank you martin perhaps youve also made it clear there are still a few imperfections were working on for the most part weve achieved a fully integrated existence not just among ourselves but with our environment we dont just live here were a part of our environment it is part of us every plant life every microscopic lifeform is part of a master design we cannot separate ourselves from it without irreparably altering who and what we are
your presence here has already begun to affect the entire balance of our society
if we do not survive the balance of our society wont mean a great deal will it

i apologise but he is performing his function as he is designed to do
what function might that be
he is the interpreter of our founders intentions for this society
a judge
yes more or less obviously he has no diplomatic talents
and obviously you do
i have been bred to fill this specific role we grow up knowing exactly what our society needs from us what we are expected to do
that must take some of fun out it
not at all my entire psychological makeup tells me that i was born to lead i am exactly what i would choose to be think of it another way are there still people in your society who have not discovered who they really are or what they were meant to do with their lives they may be in the wrong job they may be writing bad poetry or worse yet they may be great poets working as labourers never to be discovered that does not happen here it is for us an ideal existence we will not give it up easily
we will do whatever we can to help you preserve it

hannah id like you to meet our guests
oh yes of course from the starship ive been looking forward to speaking with you
hannah bates is one of our scientists if theres any way to shore up our defences hannah will find it she has a remarkable talent with theoretical physics
ive worked up a few schematics based on gravimetric potentials and deflector energy allocation
geordi troi and i will return to the enterprise when youve reached a conclusion you can contact us
commander if mister conor doesnt mind id like to stay and see more of his colony
no no that would be fine id like you to see it
riker to enterprise one to beam up
acknowledged commander
energise

youre sure my being here is not going to be disruptive
disruptive you mean what martin was saying
well i certainly wouldnt wish to throw off your entire balance
too late the damage is done
seriously
i sometimes think that strict interpreters like martin have forgotten were still human well adjust accommodate
there must be other unexpected events you have to deal with an untimely death an accident
our geneticists are able to screen out any congenital health risks before conception our population is diverse enough to maintain a genetic balance in the event of accidental death but very little that is unexpected occurs here am i making this sound incredibly dull
not at all
ill tell you the truth but ill deny it if you tell martin ive found today exhilarating meeting you meeting new people with new ideas
i feel the same about being here im something of a student of human nature and i find this all fascinating
a student of human nature
im the ships counsellor
ah im afraid you wouldnt find much work here counsellor
id book my next vacation at your hotel if you had one
well in that case i shall have to have them build one

the biospheres superstructure will never withstand the tectonic shocks the environment would be compromised
thats how i see it
your ship what kind of energy output is it capable of generating
we have a matterantimatter warp reaction system the most powerful in the starfleet normally it kicks plasma up into the terawatt range why
well either were going to have to move or that fragment is
we can move a small moon or an asteroid but a stellar core fragment thats much too massive for our tractor beam

whats that
a wild idea purely theoretical
a multiphase tractor beam
when we first spotted the fragment approaching i came up with the idea but we cant generate the kind of energy we would need you can


wed need hannah on the ship
no
with my theories and their equipment we might be able to alter the fragments path its our only chance to avoid evacuation
no one had ever come here and no one had ever left until today this is a date to note in our history books
this is in direct violation of the intentions of our founders aaron
i dont think they intended us to die martin
her absence will create an additional imbalance
temporarily the circumstances require us to be flexible
we have no idea how molecular transport will affect her dna
it wont affect her dna at all theres been over a century of evidence to prove that
you can go hannah
may i return later
i look forward to it
enterprise three to beam up energise
captains log supplemental commander la forge and hannah bates have spent three days trying to find a way to adjust the path of the core fragment if they do not succeed in the next forty eight hours we will need to begin evacuation

i believe some will choose to risk death rather than leave captain
youve spent a good deal of time on the surface how do you suggest we change their minds
im not sure we can it would mean abandoning their fundamental way of life
theyve managed to turn a dubious scientific endeavour into dogma
you dont approve of genetic engineering
it was a bad idea whose time is long past
they seem to have made it succeed
theyve given away their humanity with this genetic manipulation many of the qualities that they breed out the uncertainty the selfdiscovery the unknown those are many of the qualities that make life worth living well at least to me i wouldnt want to live knowing that my future was written that my boundaries had been already set would you
ive asked myself that question a lot during the past few days i dont know i doubt it nevertheless its what they believe in and it wont be an easy matter to talk them into leaving
this leader of theirs conor he seems to be a reasonable man
i find him very reasonable open to suggestions thoughtful quite disarming the perfect administrator
im sure will he leave when he sees theres no other choice
i dont know i hope so
you admire him
yes
then help him to see the reality of what may happen to his colony if he makes the right decision if hes as good a leader as hes designed to be then perhaps the others will follow

if we increase warp power transfer by eighty percent
its just going to blow the emitters again
we wont be able to reinforce the conduit to hold that power level it just doesnt work
yeah i havent had any sleep in so long my eyelids feel like they have lead weights attached

geordi
hmm
were you always blind
im sorry i probably shocked the hell out of you didnt i
no
ill put it back on
dont im sorry i didnt mean to embarrass you
ive never been embarrassed by this hannah never i was born blind ive always been this way
may i see it your visor
sure so i guess if i had been conceived on your world i wouldnt even be here now would i
no
no idve been terminated as a fertilised cell
it was the wish of our founders that no one had to suffer a life with disabilities
who gave them the right to decide whether or not i should be here whether or not i might have something to contribute
i dont know what to say here you go how does it work
well the visor scans the electromagnetic spectrum between one hertz and one hundred thousand terahertz converts it all to usable frequencies and then transmits that information directly to my brain
what about the data conversion rates how do you avoid a sensory overload
a bank of preprocessors compresses the data stream into pulses you see that way my visual cortex never wait a minute wait just a minute we should be able to send a highenergy pulse through the tractor system if its short enough it shouldnt overload the emitters the technology is right here if we could adapt those pulse compression routines and then apply them to the warp power conduits
wed have to avoid tractor force rebounding but that shouldnt be hard
sure with a few modifications oh thats perfect
what
if the answer to all of this is in a visor created for a blind man who never would have existed in your society no offence intended


please matthew continue



its hard to believe so much loveliness here just a few metres away from such desolation
its hard to believe were about to lose it
this must sound incredibly simplistic but cant you reengineer all this on another planet
a nursery rhyme my mother used to read to me has been running round and round my mind since this all began
a nursery rhyme
humpty dumpty sat on a wall humpty dumpty had a great fall
all the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt put humpty together again
why do we tell our children such ghastly stories
perhaps to prepare them for times like these
we are every bit as fragile as an egg and as impossible to reconstruct we are integrated and refined to such a degree that any fundamental change would lead to chaos
im so sorry aaron i wish i could do something to help
you have helped youve been wonderful these past few days youve been my counsellor
no a counsellor has to maintain a discreet distance id rather think of us as friends
friends that just wont do either

will it
aaron
i must confess a part of me knows that if i transport through these walls youll be on the other side

this is wrong
terribly wrong


in order to move the core fragment to a safe trajectory we needed our tractor beam to be able to handle high power pulses
and we needed a much more efficient emitter to do that
about four times more efficient
and we couldnt get anywhere near that without overloading the emitter arrays
so we added a little visor technology to the process and we were able to boost the effective force and at the same time lower the power conduit stress levels
whats the increase in efficiency
up to almost three hundred percent
thats not enough
thats true we wont be able to move the fragment as far as wed like to but
but if we also fortify the biospheres structural integrity at the same time
with some of the shield improvements ive discovered here it could work
of course well have to lend them some of our engineering support crews
advise mister conor number one and brief the appropriate officers prepare them for transport as soon as mister conor approves
yes sir


youre up early
im still on enterprise time aaron im going back to the ship im not going to see you again
why
because its the right thing to do
im not convinced of that
you know it as well as i do
youre angry
yes im angry im angry with myself for allowing this to happen
deanna
i could fall in love with you so easily but we both know the end of that story dont we how would martin feel about introducing halfbetazoid dna into the genetic balance
if we have to evacuate anythings possible
listen to yourself a few days ago you wouldnt even talk to us this is my fault im so sorry
i need you here this doesnt have to happen again
i have to go

good news aaron we should be able to change the course of the core fragment but well also need to fortify the structure and were going to need help to do it
well need to bring down engineering crews from the enterprise to work with your people for the next forty eight hours
engineering crews
they have to install five new shield generators and power supplies
fifty officers are waiting for your approval to transport down we dont have much time aaron
is there any other choice
none

enterprise you may begin transport when ready

captains log supplemental the enterprise has moved to a parallel course with the core fragment we must adjust its trajectory by a minimum of one point two degrees to ensure the colonys safety

bring us within range of the fragment ensign
aye sir
you may proceed

mister la forge
yes sir good luck
you too
engage tractor beam okay lets give it a try shutting down noncritical systems
emitter circuits one hundred seventy percent over standard

increasing impulse power to tractor emitters eps power levels rising

transferring warp power to tractor beam generator
graviton generators operating normally surge pulse now synchronised emitters radiating at three hundred twenty percent over standard
bridge we need more power

reduce life support to minimum requirements mister data
aye sir

three hundred ninety percent over standard
come on come on
no change in the fragments course
weve got to increase the pulse frequency
the emitter circuits wont hold for long
we wont need them for long
four hundred percent over standard
okay now were getting there
the fragments moved point four degrees off its previous heading point six five its working

we have lost one of the emitter circuits
life support failure decks nine twelve and thirteen
engage evacuation procedures for those decks geordi were going to need power back soon
acknowledged

fragments new heading adjustment is at one point zero one degrees is it enough
not yet hold on
weve lost

the second lateral emitter circuit
losing life support systems on decks five through nine evacuation procedures initiated
mister la forge
hold on captain
shipwide life support failure in fifteen seconds sir

almost there geordi course shift is at one point one six degrees

termination of all life support in five seconds

one point one eight

now mister la forge

yes sir shutting down all tractor emissions transferring power back to life support
one point two weve got it

life support normal on all decks
mister data
the fragments course has been altered by one point two one degrees sir
hail the colony
yes captain
success mister conor with the upgrades to your biosphere the core fragment should no longer be a danger
i cannot adequately express my appreciation to your crew is hannah able to hear me

yes yes go ahead aaron
this is an historic achievement hannah youve done a wonderful thing for our people
thank you
we look forward to honouring you appropriately when you return thank you again captain conor out
captains log supplemental the stellar core fragment has passed safely out of the moab system the colony was shaken by powerful temblors but fortunately there were no injuries and only minor damage was reported

energise

that should do it all members of the enterprise crew are accounted for mister conor
theyve been invaluable commander thank you again
if theres nothing else well be on our way
would you tell deanna troi for me that im sorry i didnt have the opportunity to say goodbye personally
im sure shell feel the same way

a breach in the biosphere get hannah bates

apparently the refortification wasnt adequate theres definite structural damage it appears that the tectonic shifts created a breach
can it be repaired
i dont know ill have to run a diagnostic in the lab unless we seal it and fast we may have to evacuate
how long do we have hannah
based on the level of toxicity im reading it may be only a matter of hours
mind if i give her a hand commander
by all means

isnt it amazing after all we went through
yeah amazing
looks bad its cracked well beneath the surface
why are you doing this
what do you mean
theres no breach
what are you talking about look at it its right here i measured the toxic leak you saw me
hannah my visors positronic scan would have detected the leak its molecular pattern enhancer would have picked up even the smallest crack
the damn thing doesnt miss much does it fine ill tell them the truth will that make you happy
why are you doing this
i was born to be one of the best scientific minds of my generation and in the past five days i have encountered technology that i have barely imagined and ive got to ask myself if were so brilliant how come we didnt invent any of these things
well maybe necessity really is the mother of invention you never really look for something until you need it
but all my needs have been anticipated and planned for before im even born all of us in this colony have been living in the dark ages its like were victims of a two hundred year old joke until you came we could only see to the wall of our biosphere suddenly our eyes have been opened to the infinite possibilities

asylum
she wants to leave the colony
she may not be the only one the science teams that went down to the surface fielded a lot of questions from colonists who were more than curious about whats outside their world
why shouldnt we grant them asylum
we cant do that
we have to do that
do you understand what it would do to the colony
i understand these are human beings counsellor with free will if she wants to leave she has every right to
and what happens to the colony if she does if others join her
the society is genetically integrated suddenly there would be gaps missing pieces
it would destroy them
there must be something we can do to help
we may have done too much to help them already doctor
we saved them from destruction
did we counsellor i think its time you took me to meet mister conor

transporter room three
computer halt captain i have to tell you something and it isnt easy for me because ive used very poor judgement actually ive acted quite unprofessionally
counsellor what is it you say take a deep breath
conor and i have had a relationship
i see
it should never have happened i knew there was concern about outside influences and i should have been more careful
what is your status with him now
i did not intend to see him again
would you prefer not to return to the surface
no i think i should come with you but i wanted you to know before we went down
i appreciate that computer resume
i wanted so much to help him to be there for him but the more i was
deanna we all went into this with the best intentions
i should have walked away as soon as i saw what was happening
but you didnt and thats human we make mistakes genetic manipulation or not nobodys perfect

you would ignore the welfare of the colony for your own selfish interests
the welfare of this colony would be best served by rejoining the human race
she has been contaminated by the people on that ship

aaron
mister conor i believe that you and i should talk
this is your doing we should never have answered your hails
if wed followed that advice martin wed all be dead by now so much for the welfare of this colony
you are not taking her with you
im leaving and ill tell you something else there are at least a dozen others who are ready to go with me
hannah lets allow aaron and captain picard to discuss this why dont we go for a walk
theres nothing else for them to talk about

martin
i think it would be helpful if i
i want to talk with captain picard alone
but
thank you martin

the irony is hes the one who saw this coming from the moment you arrived because i didnt want to hear it i chose not to listen
you made decisions you felt would save your colony
no no i wish it were that simple but i cant forgive myself so easily you see captain i know what hannah bates is feeling ive been feeling it as well ive found your people intriguing and stimulating as she has ive been every bit as curious about you as the next man but i am not the next man i am the leader of these people and every genetic fibre in my being demands that i protect them instead i have betrayed them i have allowed this to happen
we have both allowed this to happen
then let us both find a way to stop it from going any further
i wish i could see a way
picard i was born to govern this colony not to dismantle it
if you force them to stay you will be suppressing their human rights
if even a handful leave the damage to this society will be devastating what about the rights of those who would stay behind they are the ones who will inherit the social chaos that will follow for generations your arrival created this problem your departure solves it
that is simplistic
refuse them passage
i cannot ignore the requests of people humans who ask for transport away from here
nor can you ignore the fact that thousands will suffer if you agree to take them and as suffering grows more will demand to leave we are witnessing the end of this existence i implore you captain do not let this happen
you would have me make the decision for you nut i cant do that i am willing to talk to these people with you and i will urge them not to make an impulsive choice but if finally they choose to leave the enterprise will not turn them away

captain picard has decided to grant transport to any individuals who wish to leave genome colony im asking you to stay
aaron dont you see we cant be happy here any longer we were innocent it will never be that way again
the experiences of the past week will become part of our heritage we will adjust in a few generations we will be able to
were not willing to stay here a few generations
give me six months just wait six months before you leave
what will that accomplish
its true that our presence here has had an unintended influence on your society but its done and there is no way to undo it but feelings are running very high perhaps its not such a bad idea that you should take adequate time to weigh carefully the consequences of what youre about to do we are prepared to return in six months
in other words we are being asked to stay here for six months while they pressure us to change our minds
in five days you have seen only the most superficial evidence of what life is like outside this biosphere
would you ever choose to live aboard a ship in a bottle captain you are in command of a starship you live to explore the unknown we ask for that same privilege
hannah this is your home we are all in a sense your family dont we deserve an opportunity to open a dialogue on this issue at the very least i am only asking for six months
it wont make any difference youll only be putting the people of this colony through unnecessary pain and anguish
you are the ones who are causing pain and anguish in this colony you
dont you see aaron its over its time for you to lead our people into a new era you could come with us
when youre ready to come home you will be welcome

what will you do now
attempt to assess the damage spend the rest of my life on the near impossible task of rebuilding this society without the proper pieces
aaron you acted in the best interests of your people there was no way to avoid what happened
i replay each step of this in my mind looking for the wrong turn the mistake in judgement i can find only one and as hard as i try i cannot regret even that one in fact im quite certain that given the opportunity i would choose to make the same mistake again i can only wonder why with all the hundreds of genetically compatible women i would fall in love with you
dont say that
perhaps its your imperfections which make you so unique but i am in love with you deanna troi and i will always be

come
the colonists are all on board sir
how many finally
twenty three
if we ever needed reminding of the importance of the prime directive it is now
the prime directive doesnt apply theyre human
doesnt it our very presence may have damaged even destroyed their way of life whether or not we agree with that way of life or whether theyre human or not is irrelevant number one we are responsible
we had to respond to the threat from the core fragment didnt we
of course we did but in the end we may have proved just as dangerous to that colony as any core fragment could ever have been
conundrum

captains log stardate  were investigating a series of subspace signals that may indicate intelligent life in the epsilon silar system we are within sensor range


the characteristic response to the kriskov gambit is to counter with the elmitra exchange particularly since i have already taken both your rooks by missing that opportunity you have left your king vulnerable
well see
as you wish counsellor check

intriguing you have devised a completely unanticipated response to a classic attack you will checkmate my king in seven moves
data chess isnt just a game of ploys and gambits its a game of intuition
you are a challenging opponent counsellor
thanks but dont think a compliments going to get you out of our bet you owe me one samarian sunset made in the traditional style as only you can make it data
i will honour our agreement
power play

captains log stardate  we are going into orbit around an unexplored mclass moon of mabbu six though the moon was reported to be uninhabited we have picked up a weak distress call

the intense electromagnetic whirlwinds on the moons surface make it virtually impossible to locate the source of the signal captain
any indications of life mister worf
scanners read negative sir but they may be affected by the interference
have you ever heard anything like this data
i believe so commander at starfleet academy
the academy
i will verify it just as i thought it is a starfleet subspace distress signal standard to daedalusclass starships
there hasnt been a daedalus class in service for what
one hundred seventy two years sir
are there any records of missing ships in this vicinity
the uss essex under the command of captain bryce shumar disappeared in this sector over two centuries ago
daedalus class
i have accessed the subspace transponder signature of the essex it is identical to the signal coming from the moons surface
w arrived a little late
mute it mister data with that storm activity down there it isnt worth the risk to check on a ghost ship advise starfleet that we have solved the mystery of captain shumar and the essex
im not sure we have someones down there alive
first officers log supplemental the electromagnetic interference on the surface has been judged too dangerous for anyone to transport down so we have taken a shuttle to investigate


shields are holding sir
wind shear is incredible data keep an eye on the stabilisers if its anything like this on the ground i dont see how anyone can survive on this moon for long
maybe theyve been living underground
question is where i still cant locate the source of the damn signal its bouncing around more than we are
forward thrusters hav
ethics


no question about it she was bluffing worf
bluffing is not one of counsellor trois strong suits
im still reading some chlorinide leakage but i cant pin it down
maybe up here

it would have been unwise to call yes my hand was not strong enough
you had jacks and eights she bluffed you with a pair of sixes
how did you know what i had
lets just say i had a special insight into the cards maybe next time you should bring a deck thats not transparent to infrared light not to worry worf i only peek after the hand is over still nothing ill get a dynoscan well try again
commander is that what you wanted
yes if anything changes you let me know ensign run a dynoscan

look out

worf
commander what happened
la forge to sickbay medical emergency in cargo bay three

what happened
the containers you were checking fell on you youre lucky to be alive

doctor i will not attempt to leave sickbay without your approval the restraining field is not necessary
worf there is no restraining field
but i cant move my legs
i know you cant move because one of the containers shattered seven of your vertebrae and crushed your spinal cord im afraid theres no way we can repair this kind of injury
captains log stardate  lieutenant worf has been removed from active duty following a severe injury although a neurospecialist has arrived doctor crusher believes his paralysis may be permanent


welcome to the enterprise doctor russell im beverly crusher
a pleasure i have some equipment aboard the potemkin would you please have it sent to one of your medical labs
of course send it to medlab four
yes doctor
before we get down to business i just wanted to say that i had the pleasure of reading your paper on cybernetic regeneration recently
really youre the first person to mention it
i thought it was brilliant

your ideas on bioactive interfaces border on revolutionary its going to be a genuine pleasure working with you
thank you have you had a chance to review worfs case history yet
only briefly i must admit i was a little shocked to find the state of klingon neurological medicine to be so primitive
its a cultural bias when i contacted the klingon medical division they informed me that they usually let the patient die in a case like this as a result theyve done almost no research on neurological trauma
well be in uncharted waters
worf is having a hard time dealing with his injuries hes always been a difficult patient but now hes a little tough at first but im sure youll get to like him after you get to
doctor i know that as a starship doctor you have to maintain close ties with patients but i think it would be best if i maintain a discreet distance that way i can give you a completely objective opinion regarding treatment
yes youre probably right
good well i believe you said ill be working in medlab four
right this way


you look pretty good for someone whos been eating sickbay food for three days
please sit down commander thank you for agreeing to see me in this condition
im not a klingon i dont think theres any shame in someone being injured
i am not merely injured commander doctor crusher believes my paralysis to be permanent
im sorry
i have a personal favour to ask
name it
i want you to assist me in performing the heghbat ceremony i want you to help me die
what
when a klingon can no longer stand and face his enemies as a warrior when he becomes a burden to his friends and family it is time for the heghbat time for him to die
there must be other options
no there are not i will not live as an object of pity or shame my life as a klingon is over
mister worf i will not help a friend commit suicide
you and i have served together for many years fought side by side i know you to be a brave and honourable man if you truly consider me a friend help me now help me end my life as i have lived it with dignity and honour please

the cortical spinal tract has continued to deteriorate over the last seventy two hours despite cpk enzymatic therapy
what about alkysine treatment
ineffective
overdesigned klingon anatomy twenty three ribs two livers eightchambered heart doublelined neural pia mater ive never seen so many unnecessary redundancies in one body
unnecessary the klingons refer to it as the braklul almost every vital function in their bodies has a builtin redundancy in case any primary organ or system fails
its a good design in theory but in practice all the extra organs means just that much more that can go wrong let me show you something ive been experimenting with dna based generators this is a genetronic replicator it reads the dna coding of damaged organs translates that into a specific set of replicant instructions and then begins to grow a replacement
ive read of some of the preliminary work youve done
the early results have been very encouraging beverly the genetronic replicator can create a completely new neural conduit for your lieutenant worf
replace his entire spinal column
exactly instead of splicing and pasting together broken connections like a couple of glorified tailors we create a new living system
i had no idea you were already using this on humanoids
i havent been thisll be the first time
first time
ive done dozens of holosimulations the success rate is up to thirty seven percent
even a holographic patient would balk at those odds
sooner or later it has to be tried on a living patient
youre talking about a spinal column even before we could replace it we have to remove the existing one and we dont know enough about klingon neurological medicine to reattach it if something goes wrong hell die i agree it has remarkable potential but youre still in the most preliminary stages of research no im afraid i cant justify the risk to worf well have to do with more conventional approaches
youre probably right its too radical an approach
doctor crusher please report to the bridge
on my way

doctor the transport ship denver has struck a gravitic mine left over from the cardassian war theyve sustained heavy damage
their last message said they were attempting to crash land on one of the planets in the mericor system we should arrive in just under seven hours
how many people were aboard
the denvers standard crew complement is twenty three but they were transporting five hundred seventeen colonists to the beloti sector
ill need to convert all three shuttlebays to emergency triage centres i also want all civilians with medical training to report for duty
make it so
captain may i speak with you in private
of course number one you have the bridge mister data
aye sir

i have always tried to keep an open mind not to judge someone elses culture by my own but for me to be a part of this ceremony
i understand from doctor crusher that worf will never regain the use of his legs
that doesnt mean his life is over
thats a very human perspective will for a klingon in worfs position his life is over
i cant accept that
will if you were dying if you were terminally ill with an incurable disease and facing the remaining few days of your life in pain wouldnt you come to look on death as a release
worf isnt dying and he is not in pain he could live a long life
you or i could learn to live with that disability but not worf his life ended when those containers fell on him we dont have to agree with it we dont have to understand it but we do have to respect his beliefs
i can respect his beliefs but he is asking me to take an active role in his committing suicide
hes asking for your help because youre his friend that means that youre going to have to make your decision based on that friendship
which leaves me back where i started
will look im sorry i cannot help you to make this decision but i can tell you this klingons choose their friends with great care if he didnt know he could count on you he never would have asked

why wont you let me see him
alexander i told you its not my decision your father doesnt want to
i dont believe you my father wants to see me youre the one keeping me away from him
i think you know thats not true
then why cant i see him
come here hes been injured and hes embarrassed and to have anyone see him now would make him feel worse even if it were you
this is part of that klingon stuff isnt it my mother always said that klingons had a lot of dumb ideas about honour
alexander that klingon stuff is very important to your father
well it isnt very important to me i dont care about being klingon i just want to see my father
its been a long day why dont you get ready for bed and well talk about this again in the morning

alexander is scared confused hurt all because his father is refusing to see him
you know why i left those instructions
yes i do its not the klingon way right
it is a question of honour and i would ask you that you respect my wishes in this matter counsellor
all i care about at this moment is a little boy whos terrified hes going to lose his father

maybe its time you stopped lying here worrying about your honour and started thinking about someone else like your son

would you like us to come back later
no please come in doctor
this is doctor toby russell shes from the adelman neurological institute she specialises in spinal injuries like yours weve discussed a variety of surgical procedures im afraid none of them will repair the spinal cord but we have found a way for you to regain much of your mobility we can implant a series of neural transducers in your lower torso and legs theyre designed to pick up the electrical impulses from your brain and stimulate the corresponding muscles with a little work you can eventually regain sixty to seventy percent of your motor control
the first step would be to fit your legs with motor assist units like this one theyre a training device once youve mastered using them we can move on to the implants

now try to move your leg

no no thats good for a first try it will take some time before you get used to manipulating the
no  i will not live like that
these are very sophisticated devices with enough time they will give you
sixty percent of my mobility no i will not be seen lurching through corridors like some halfklingon machine the object of ridicule and disgust
perhaps this all seems a bit frightening to you know i want you to take some time before making a decision think about it
there is one other option id like you to consider its called genetronic replication its still in the experimental stage but if it works it will restore virtually all of your mobility and without the need for artificial implants

i thought we had discussed genetronics
we did
i also thought wed decided against recommending it
you heard him hed rather die than live with the implants i just gave him a better option than suicide
hes grasping for straws and youre giving him one now instead of dealing with his paralysis hes going to be thinking about this miracle cure of yours
theres a real chance this could work and if it does itll be a major breakthrough in neurogenetics that will change a lot of peoples lives
youre using the desperation of an injured man as an excuse to try a procedure that you couldnt do under normal circumstances i checked with starfleet medical they have turned down your request to test genetronics on humanoids three times already
are you really going to hide behind the rules of some bureaucracy beverly your patients life is at stake here
look before you do any of this
picard to doctor crusher
go ahead captain

weve located the survivors from the denver

were ready down here we have triage teams standing by

very well well begin transporting the survivors on board immediately bridge out

beverly could you use an extra pair of hands
absolutely


father

come in alexander
deanna said you hurt your back that you couldnt walk
i am still struggling with my injury
i was worried about you
there is much to discuss there will be difficult times ahead you must be strong
i understand
good as klingons we must always be prepared for any

father
take him away
worf let me help you
leave
alexander go on itll be all right ill take care of your father


use this to cauterise the tissue
yes doctor
what happened here
he went into neural metaphasic shock
from leporazine thats unusual
he couldnt take leporazine his blood pressure was too low i had to try a different treatment
a morathial series
no i tried a new rybotherapy ive been working with its called borathium ive had some very good results
you used this man to test one of your theories
borathium is decades ahead of leporazine and morathial
morathial would have saved his life
his injuries were so severe i dont think any conventional treatment couldve saved him
the point is you didnt even try standard treatments
i made the choice i thought gave him the best chance of surviving isnt that what you would have done
i think you used this situation in order to test one of your theories just like youre trying to do with worf
thats what this is really about isnt it lieutenant worf im offering him a chance to recover fully a chance you cant give him
what this is about is the kind of medicine you seem to practice
i make no excuses for my approach to medicine i dont like losing a patient any more than you do but im looking down a long road doctor this man didnt die for nothing the data that i gathered is invaluable it will eventually help save thousands of lives
i doubt if that will be any comfort his family
let me ask you this if some years from now borathium therapy were to save the life of someone you loved would you still condemn me
i will not be drawn into a hypothetical argument doctor your research on this ship is over youre relieved of all medical duties until further notice is that clear
perfectly

doctor im on my way to look in on your patient
be my guest just dont expect a lot of conversation hes in full klingon mode honourable strong and closed minded
i understand that youve relieved doctor russell of duty
thats right shes irresponsible i wont have her practicing medicine on this ship
beverly maybe you should consider letting her go ahead with this genetronic procedure
how can you say that she has a theory based on a little empirical knowledge and a lot of supposition
if he cant make a full recovery worf will to kill himself
not in my sickbay he wont ill put him in a restraining field and post security around his door before i let him commit suicide
and how long will you keep him there a week a month a year
if i have to suicide is not an option putting aside for a moment the fact that a paraplegic can live a very full life there is also a conventional therapy that could restore much of his mobility
but not all of it
no not all of it there are some things i cant fix klingon or no he is going to have to accept his condition
beverly he cant make the journey youre asking of him you want him to go from contemplating suicide to accepting his condition and living with the disability but its too far the road between covers a lifetime of values beliefs he cant do it beverly but perhaps he can come part of the way maybe he can be persuaded to forgo the ritual in order to take the chance at regaining the kind of life he needs a klingon may not be good at accepting defeat but he knows all about taking risks
the first tenet of good medicine is never make the patient any worse right now worf is alive and functioning if he goes into that operation he could come out a corpse
this may not be good medicine but for worf it may be his only choice


i am ready commander
ive been studying this ritual of yours do you know what ive decided i think its despicable i hate everything about it the casual disregard for life the way it tries to cloak suicide in some glorious notion of honour i may have to respect your beliefs but i dont have to like them
it is not something i expect you to understand
no all you really expect me to do is bring you the knife and then walk away so you can kill yourself in peace well im not going to make it that easy for you
it is not easy for me but each of us must die in our own time and my time
remember sandoval hit by a disruptor blast two years ago she lived for about a week fanglee marla aster tasha yar how many men and women how many friends have we watched die ive lost count every one of them every single one fought for life until the very end
i do not welcome death commander
are you sure because i get the sense youre feeling pretty noble about the whole thing look at me arent i courageous arent i an honourable klingon let me remind you of something a klingon does not put his desires above those of his family or his friends how many people on this ship consider you a friend how many owe you their lives have you ever thought about how youve affected the people around you how we might feel about your dying
will you or will you not help me with the heghbat
you are my friend and in spite of everything ive said if it were my place i would probably help you but ive been studying klingon ritual and klingon law and ive discovered that its not my place to fill that role according to tradition that honour falls to a family member preferably the oldest son
that is impossible he is a child
the son of a klingon is a man the day he can first hold a blade true
alexander is not fully klingon he is part human
thats an excuse what you really mean is it would be too hard for you to look at your son and tell him to bring you the knife watch you stab it into your heart then pull the knife from your chest and wipe your blood on his sleeve thats the rite of death isnt it well im sorry mister worf i cant help you theres only one person on this ship who can

you said you wanted to see me
i need you to help me
anything father
i have taught you about klingon customs the beliefs which we value according to tradition i must take my life after suffering this kind of injury but i have decided to break with tradition i have decided to live
im glad father
i must still undergo a dangerous operation i may still die but it will not be by my own hand return this to our quarters
yes sir

chief medical officers log supplemental after further consultation with starfleet medical and a great deal of soul searching i have reluctantly granted lieutenant worfs request to undergo the genetronic procedure

we started doing multiplications today the teacher said im faster than anybody else in my class

we will speak again soon
yes father

if i die he must be cared for
ill make sure he reaches your parents home safely
no they are elderly they cannot care for alexander counsellor i have a serious request to make of you would you consider
you want me to raise alexander
i have come to have a great respect for you deanna you have been most helpful in guiding me since alexanders arrival i cant imagine anyone who would be a better parent to my son if it is too much to ask
id be honoured

i am ready


focus the drechtal beams on the anterior and posterior spinal roots
focused
initiate
all neural connections below the first cervical vertebrae have been separated
microtome im severing the brain stem now
cerebral cortex placed on life support at zero eight thirty one hours three hours twenty six minutes remaining until onset of primary brain dysfunction
okay lets remove the support frame
exoscalpel

ive notified starfleet that our survey of sector three seven six two eight will be delayed at least a week while we drop off survivors from the denver
good i understand from mister la forge theres a minor fluctuation in the starboard warp coil
ive scheduled a stress simulation routine for this afternoon to check it out has there been any word
no


preliminary genetronic scans are complete
initiating dna sequencer
reading the initial sequences at ten to the ninth base pairs per second
once were past the first two levels well begin the encoding sequence increase tch levels to

whats happened
the scanner is having trouble reading the klingon dorsal root ganglia
did this show up in your simulations
yes but i thought id made sufficient adjustments bring me the detronal scanner i can scan the ganglia manually itll just take a little longer
one hour forty three minutes until primary brain dysfunction


retract the paraspinal muscle
got it watch the proximal nerve endings
i see them make sure the cranial segment is at least fifteen centimetres from the brain stem
im reading a slight fluctuation in the isocortex
twenty ccs inoprovaline
okay release retractors on the paraspinal how much longer can we keep him on life support
twenty seven minutes
cover close please
ready
tissue growth proceeding at anticipated rates no initial signs of rejection 
okay ready terminate life support
life support disengaged
neural connections appear stable
looking good so far
fluctuations in the isocortex
forty ccs inoprovaline
synaptic response falling
bp dropping now sixty over ten vektal response falling rapidly
increase oxygen mixture to ninety five percent
beginning direct synaptic stimulation
respiration is shallow and rapid no response in the isocortex
seventy five ccs inoprovaline
heart rate is erratic
hes going into cardiac arrest
all right lets go to chloromydride fifteen ccs
were losing him no bp no pulse brain activity
showing no higher brain functions
all right twenty five ccs cordrazine
thatll kill him
looks like weve done a pretty good job of that already doctor
no bp no pulse no activity in the isocortex
cortical stimulator now again again again again
doctor
all right make a note in the log death occurred at twelve hundred forty hours
it was all going so well no anomalies during replication no initial rejection


no
alexander i am so sorry
i want to see him
alex
no i want to see him


activate biomonitors twenty five ccs polyadrenaline
whats going on
im not sure but if im right one of those unnecessary redundancies
doctor
i dont believe it begin cardioaid and ventilation thats amazing there must be a backup for his synaptic functions as well
vital signs are stabilising
begin rybosynetic therapy increase oxygen mixture to ninety percent lets prepare a thalamic booster series

well id say your patients recovery is going well youre not even going to acknowledge what i did for him are you you just cant admit that it was my research that made this possible
i am delighted that worf is going to recover you gambled he won not all of your patients are so lucky you scare me doctor you risk your patients lives and justify it in the name of research genuine research takes time sometimes a lifetime of painstaking detailed work in order to get any results not for you you take short cuts right through living tissue you put your research ahead of your patients lives and as far as im concerned thats a violation of our most sacred trust im sure your work will be hailed as a stunning breakthrough enjoy your laurels doctor im not sure i could


this is going to take time worf your muscles are still sorting out their new signals dont rush it

alexander remember what we talked about your father wants to do this by himself
its all right counsellor i would appreciate some help from my son we will work together
yes sir
the outcast

captains log stardate  we have been contacted by an androgynous race called the jnaii to investigate the mysterious disappearance of one of their shuttlecraft


captain we are approaching the designated coordinates
on screen long range scan mister data
sensors find no evidence of the shuttle anywhere within the star system
it couldnt have travelled outside the system
mister data reconfigure high resolution sweep radius one million kilometres check for any debris
scan shows no debris within that radius
i dont understand it a shuttle doesnt simply vanish
there has to be an explanation
captain i am detecting an unusual reading it appears to be a neutrino emission with no visible source
explanation
i have none sir i recommend we launch a probe
make it so
probe is launched
sensors show no evidence of any unusual phenomenon

the probe is no longer transmitting
what happened where did it go
captains log supplemental the sudden disappearance of our probe suggests that we may have found the first instance of what is called null space an anomaly which until now had been only theoretical commander riker has been working around the clock with a team of jnaii specialists to formalise this hypothesis

during the creation of a star system when clouds of interstellar dust and gas coalesce turbulent regions of magnetic and gravitational fields may develop if certain conditions occur these fields can condense into abnormal pockets of space
we think your system contains one of these null pockets if were right the pocket would absorb electromagnetic energy from anything that entered it
like a shuttlecraft
or a probe making them powerless
but outside the pocket all the energy is bent around it making it naturally cloaked thats why we cannot see it and our sensors cannot read it
is the shuttle still there
we think so the shuttle probably wasnt able to sustain its energy but other than that it wouldnt be damaged
since our shuttles carry plestorene based backup systems we think life support would sustain for as long as ten days
then perhaps our crew has survived
we can send one of our own shuttles but its energy would also be absorbed our chief engineer is working on a way to maintain the power reserves long enough to rescue your crew
commander were grateful for your help whatever resources we can provide are yours

ive been thinking when the time comes i would like to pilot the shuttle
its a starfleet craft
i cannot ask you to put yourself in danger to rescue our crew
you cant pilot a shuttle youre not familiar with
i happen to be a good pilot
i happen to be a good pilot too and i know my way around the starfleet shuttle so what if we team up
when can we go over the shuttle flight operations
right now


is this the one
this is it shortrange craft two twelve hundred fifty millicochrane warp engines
looks like microfusion thrusters
right
armament
none usually this ones been fitted with two typefour phaser emitters well use those to chart the null space
chart it
mister la forge wants to get an idea of the size of the pocket he thinks the rate of energy absorption is linked to its size
im not sure how we go about mapping something we cant see
well thats where the emitters come in we shoot out a series of photon pulses into the pocket and chart where each one disappears from that we should get a fairly complete outline
lets take a look at the controls

later well try a flight simulation right now lets do a systems review ill talk you through it
let me try it propulsion system transfer conduits wheres the schematic reactor assembly oh there it is engine nacelles theres nothing here thats unfamiliar navigational deflector redundant graviton polarity source generators
you handle these controls like you grew up in a shuttle
i did my parents were pilots i was flying with them before i could walk and as soon as i was old enough i entered flight school krite was my instructor
he had a good student
he commander there are no hes or shes in a species without gender
okay for two days ive been trying to construct sentences without personal pronouns now i give up what should i use it to us thats rude
we use a pronoun which is neutral i do not think there is really a translation
then ill just have to muddle through so forgive me if a stray he or she slips by okay
well if thats the systems review i dont see any problem whats next
lunch

what is it
split pea soup its my fathers recipe i had it programmed into the replicators well
unusual but i think i like it
its very healthy helps to keep you warm on cold alaskan nights
we prefer to stay warm by sleeping with a friend
i see
not to mate just to sleep together for warmth
still sounds better than pea soup
we are puzzling to you arent we
a little its hard to grasp the idea of no gender
its just as hard for us to understand the strange division in your species males and females you are male tell me about males what is it that makes you different from females
snips and snails and puppy dog tails
you have a dogs tail
its an old nursery rhyme girls are made from sugar and spice and boys are made from snips and snails
that makes it sound better to be female
its an oldfashioned way of looking at the sexes not to say that theres no real difference between them physically men are bigger stronger in the upper body we have different sexual organs men cant bear young
and what about feelings or emotional attitudes are they different
most people think so but thats the kind of question that would take a lifetime to answer let me ask you whats it like on a planet where the people have no gender
im afraid i dont understand
well who leads when you dance if you dance
we do and whoevers taller leads
without the battle of the sexes you probably dont have as many arguments
just because we dont have gender doesnt mean we dont have conflicts were very strongminded we love a good fight
from the sound of it theres not that much difference between our species
maybe not what kind of woman do you find attractive
i like one whos intelligent and sure of herself who i can talk with and get something back but the most important thing of all she has to laugh at my jokes
 tell me is that the kind of woman that all human males prefer
not at all some like quiet demure women others prefer a lot of energy some only respond to physical attractiveness others couldnt care less there are no rules
you make it sound very complex
believe me it is
well perhaps it is that complexity which makes differences in the sexes so interesting
good evening commander
good evening
please take my place krite i have to be going thank you for going over the flight protocols commander it was very helpful
captains log supplemental commander riker and the jnaii pilot have set out to chart the null space pocket if they are successful we can then proceed with a rescue attempt

ive illuminated the delta four grid map well start there and expand
stand by forward phaser array
pulse vanished at delta four point two by point three
firing second burst
delta four point four by point five
this is working initiating computer task handoff
commander tell me about your sexual organs
er
is that an uncomfortable subject for humans
no but it doesnt tend to be a topic of casual conversation
im interested in your mating practices what is involved with two sexes
correcting course zero two one mark zero
mating
right well its pretty simple men inseminate the women women carry the baby
our foetuses are incubated in fibrous husks which the parents inseminate from what we know of other species our method is less risky and less painful
and less enjoyable
less enjoyable
for humans the sexual act brings a closeness and intimacy it can be a very pleasurable experience inseminating a husk
thats just the last step mating is a long ritual for us full of variety and invention i assure you it is extremely pleasurable
im picking up a neutrino emission from within the null space
that may be coming from our shuttle ill note these coordinates
i wonder
what
if a human and a jnaii would be sexually compatible
i dont know
of course it would never be permitted
why not
the idea of gender it is offensive to my people you see long ago we had two sexes as you do but we evolved into a higher form i dont mean to sound insulting but on my planet we have been taught that gender is primitive
primitive
less evolved
maybe so but sometimes theres a lot to be said for an experience thats primitive
delta five grid map is fully plotted
adjusting course zero two nine mark zero

the port engines down
reducing power in the starboard nacelle
thats not enough i have to activate the manoeuvring thrusters
thrusters arent responding ill try to reroute the firing sequence
inertial dampers are failing hang on

enterprise to shuttle do you read me
affirmative weve lost an engine
well try to get a tractor beam on you
the sooner the better enterprise we have an injury transport soren directly to sickbay
right away commander

its just a mild concussion youre going to be fine this will reduce the inflammation
doctor you are female
yes
forgive me i do not mean to be rude but im curious what is it like
well its just the way i am ive never really thought about what its like
ive noticed you tend to have longer hair and you arrange it more elaborately and you apply colour to your bodies
colour
you put colour on your mouths and your eyes your cheeks your fingernails the men dont
thats true
then it is up to women to attract the men
oh no men want to be attractive too believe me they just go about it differently
no colour
no colour they like to pretend theyre not doing anything to attract a woman even when its the most important thing on their minds
this is very confusing then are women considered more superior or are men
neither in the past women were often considered weak and inferior but that hasnt been true for a long time

will your copilot is going to be fine the injury was minor
im glad to hear it
im afraid youre not rid of me yet commander i will be able to complete the mission
glad you feel better
what happened what made the shuttle go into a spin
the port nacelle must have nipped one of the protrusions from the null pocket and shut it down
are we still on schedule then
that depends on how youre doing
im fine we should go check the port engine
whoa maybe we should get the doctors opinion first
doctor
i dont see any problem but if you feel any symptoms headache dizziness come back
you have my word


all right this hand the game is federation day
what is that
well the federation was founded in twenty one sixty one so twos sixes and aces are wild
that is a womans game
oh why is that
all those wild cards they support a weak hand a mans game has no wild cards
let me get this straight are you saying its a womans game because women are weak and need more help
yes
and just this afternoon i was insisting to one of the jnaii that those attitudes were but a distant memory
the jnaii they bother me
why worf
they just do theyre all alike no males no females
well im sure were just as strange to them
well one of them seems to be overcoming the differences at least in regards to one of us
what are you saying doctor
i could be wrong but i get the definite impression that soren is attracted to commander riker
a human and a jnaii impossible
why
good question worf
with all these wild cards it is difficult to know exactly what is in my hand however i will open with fifty

the portable transporter array is in when we get into null space well need to initialise it before we can transport the jnaii crew to this shuttle but there should still be enough power left to beam all of us back to the enterprise
is the buffer field generator installed
not yet geordi thinks thatll be ready by oh eight hundred hours tomorrow but before that we should see if we can balance this engine can you access the starboard manifold thrust

there
set the arc at six point three ill optimise the plasma flow
commander id like to tell you something something thats not easy to say
whats that
i find you attractive im taking a terrible risk telling you that it means revealing something to you something that if it were known on my planet would be very dangerous for me occasionally among my people there are a few who are born different who are throwbacks from the era when we all had gender some have strong inclinations to maleness and some have urges to be female i am one of the latter
i have to admit i had a feeling you were different
i was hoping you would but in front of krite and the others i must be careful not to reveal myself
why
on our world these feelings are forbidden those who are discovered are shamed and ridiculed and only by undergoing psychotectic therapy and having all elements of gender eliminated can they become accepted into society again those of us who have these urges live secret and guarded lives we seek each other out always hiding always terrified of being discovered
how long have you known that you were like this
ive known i was different all my life but i didnt understand how or why until i was older
and when you realised what then
i remember when i was very young before i knew what i was there was a rumour in my school that one of the students preferred a gender in that case male the children started making fun of him and every day they were more cruel they could tell he was afraid and somehow that seemed to encourage them one morning in class he appeared bleeding and in ripped clothes he said he had fallen down and of course the school authorities found out and took him away and gave him psychotectic treatments when he came back he stood in front of the whole school and told us how happy he was now that he had been cured after that i realised how dangerous it was to be different and once i got older and knew what i was i was terrified i have had to live with that fear ever since
do you have relationships with others
yes with those who have discovered they are male i have had to live a life of pretence and lies but with you i can be honest please dont say anything just think about it

thats it commander everything checks out the energy buffer is installed and functioning i estimate it should reduce the power drain to your systems by about forty percent
any guess how long well have
lets just say you dont want to waste any time once you get in there youll have to give him continuous readouts on energy consumption i cant even predict if the drain will be at a constant rate
i understand
then thats it commander ill monitor you as far as i can but once you get inside that pocket youre on your own
we dont have any idea what condition the shuttle crew is in so well all beam directly to sickbay
ill notify doctor crusher to be standing by

la forge to bridge
picard here
were ready to initiate shuttle prelaunch sequence

proceed mister data
initiating prelaunch sequence
request flight clearance
clearance is granted the shuttle is under way sir
good hunting commander
thank you sir see you for dinner

heading confirmed energy readings are normal with power reserves stabilised at one hundred percent
acknowledged
its dead ahead approximately fifty kilometres
riker to enterprise were taking her in

riker to enterprise riker to enterprise
power reserves are down to eighty four percent
look  try hailing them
calling the taris murn do you read me
getting sensor readings theyre unconscious but theyre alive stand by im going to transport them over here
power reserves at sixty eight percent and dropping

the null space must be affecting the annular confinement beam
we used ten megajoules with that attempt were down to thirty four percent of reserves
we can give it one more try more than that we wont have enough power to get ourselves out of here

they need medical attention quickly
okay stand by to transport to the enterprise here we go

energy consumption
were down to nine percent we dont have enough to get back
if we just sit here well lose all of our systems within an hour including life support okay im rerouting the propulsion system to the transporter rechannel the navigation systems lets transfer every microjoule of energy weve got sensors life support this might give us one last shot
but if we use an energy shift of that size itll overload the phase compensators the shuttle
will explode but if we stay here were dead anyway maximum energy levels five seconds see you in a minute



theyve been oxygen deprived there doesnt seem to be any significant damage prepare some dexalin
yes doctor
commander thank you
your colleague soren was very helpful
captain would you all join us this evening we would like to express our gratitude
wed be happy to
noor will be eager to get a first hand report we should return to the surface
i will see you later tonight commander

there you are commander i wondered what had happened to our guest of honour
i just needed some air i can only take so much of these social functions and then i need to breathe a little
i would think you had attended so many affairs like this that it would become second nature to you
i was raised outdoors im never been very comfortable in crowded rooms
what do you think of our planet isnt it beautiful
yes it is its beautiful
we have many varieties of plant life perhaps you would like to inspect some of them
yes i would ive always been interested in exobotany
please let me take you on a tour
thank you its kind of you


one of my favourites is this menellen tree the leaves first turn pure white and then blue when the weather gets cold this is called a falla bush it produces a fragrant flower on only one day of the year

captains log stardate  in the hope that a detailed map of null space will prevent the loss of other ships we remain in orbit of jnaii charting the anomaly


come in hello will
whats all this
wonderful things my mother sent me a box that belonged to one of my fathers ancestors it was stored on earth and just recently turned up
do you know who any of these people are
no some of the pictures have names on but most of them dont i look at these faces and i wonder who they are and if they could be related to me
this one looks like you  deanna i have something on my mind i had to see you
has something happened
ive met someone someone whos becoming important to me
soren
yes youre my friend i thought i dont know i thought i should tell you
im glad you did
nothing will change between us will it
of course it will all relationships are constantly changing but well still be friends maybe better friends youre a part of my life and im a part of yours that much will always be true


hello im here to see soren
i know
we had an appointment we were going to discuss
i dont think so commander
excuse me
we know about the two of you we know what youre doing
where is soren
were going to make sure it doesnt happen again
answer me where is soren
in custody and theres nothing you can do about it
the hell there isnt

you are aware of the charges against you
yes
do you intend to dispute them well what is your response

commander riker these proceedings are closed to everyone
i think i just opened them
sir this is a private matter we are grateful for your recent help but that gives you no right to interfere with our personal concerns
i want you to know what really happened its all my fault i was attracted to soren i pursued i insisted i didnt understand your ways until she explained them to me and rejected me nothing happened between us i ask your forgiveness i behaved inappropriately
is this true
no
soren
i am tired of lies i am female i was born that way i have had those feelings those longings all of my life it is not unnatural i am not sick because i feel this way i do not need to be helped i do not need to be cured what i need and what all of those who are like me need is your understanding and your compassion we have not injured you in any way and yet we are scorned and attacked and all because we are different what we do is no different from what you do we talk and laugh we complain about work and we wonder about growing old we talk about our families and we worry about the future and we cry with each other when things seem hopeless all of the loving things that you do with each other that is what we do and for that we are called misfits and deviants and criminals what right do you have to punish us what right do you have to change us what makes you think you can dictate how people love each other
i congratulate you soren your decision to admit your perversion makes it much more likely that we can help you
wait wait wait you dont have to do this
commander
let me take her with me she can go back to the enterprise we would give her asylum you would never have to see her again that would solve the problem wouldnt it youd be rid of her she would never be able to influence anyone again
commander after sorens diatribe you must think that we are a cruel repressive people nothing could be further from the truth
im just trying to find a solution that would satisfy everyone
we are concerned about our citizens we take our obligations to them seriously soren is sick and sick people want to get well
did it occur to you that she might like to stay the way she is
you dont understand we have a very high success rate in treating deviants like this and without exception they become happier people after their treatment and grateful that we care enough to cure them you see commander on this world everyone wants to be normal
she is
take soren to quarters treatment will begin tomorrow
dont do this soren
no more commander
riker to enterprise one to transport

i cant just leave her there theyll give her these psychotectic treatments i dont know what to do
well i could talk to noor perhaps theres a way to work something out
sir their minds are set they dont want to hear another alternative
then im not sure that theres much that we can do
there has to be my relationship with soren is not trivial shes very important to me its my fault that this happened i have to help her
will if youve come here for sanction to take matters into your own hands i cant give it to you
i know that but i have to do something
interfering in the internal matters of the jnaii is prohibited by the prime directive
im aware of that
if you violate it you may jeopardising your career starfleet doesnt take these matters lightly will i cant defend you if you go too far do you understand that
youve made yourself very clear sir
dont risk everything youve worked for
thank you may i be excused now


who is it
lieutenant worf

come in
commander i have the plan for deploying warning buoys around the null space
fine leave it ill take a look at it later
yes sir
thank you youre dismissed
commander i am aware of what transpired on the planet surface are you by any chance considering an unannounced visit i will go with you
lieutenant
sir you are my commanding officer if you order me to stay on board i will obey but i ask you not to give that order a warrior does not let a friend face danger alone


somethings happening theyre leaving

okay  excuse me i need to speak to her alone for a moment

wait
dont worry well be out of here in a minute
please dont
all right ere almost there
you cannot do this
i wont let them hurt you youll be safe on the enterprise
i am so sorry it was my fault that you got involved in all this
everythings going to be all right everythings going to be fine
no it is not
what are you talking about
it was all a mistake and i should have realised it from the beginning
what
that i was sick i had these terrible urges and that is why i reached out to you but it was wrong and i see that now i do not understand how i could have done what i did
maybe doctor crusher can treat you and bring you back to the way you were
why would i want that
soren i love you
im sorry

how long to the phelan system mister data

at warp six fifty three hours sir

finished sir
very well ensign take us out of orbit set a course for the phelan system warp six
aye sir

i just had a feeling
i guess its better to be lucky than good
its the way your left eyebrow raises when your bluffing just kidding commander

go ahead
commander la forge needs you in sickbay
on my way

at first i thought the catwalk was spinning as it turns out it was me luckily ensign fletcher was there to grab me its a long way down to the bottom of the warp core
you have all the symptoms of an inner ear infection that would explain the dizziness and the headaches but theres no physical evidence my guess is youve been working too hard
i have been putting a lot of extra hours on this typhon expanse project
ill give you twenty ccs of vertazine that should clear up the dizziness but finding time to relax is up to you
what what is it
geordi have you had these symptoms before
no
youre sure
yeah im positive why
its funny i feel like weve discussed this before and i remember giving you a hypospray for dizziness
ive never had these symptoms before today so you must be thinking about another patient
no im sure it was you well try to get some rest and try to stay away from high places for a few days just in case
thanks doc
goodnight
goodnight



as you can see the typhon expanse is huge if we want to chart the most remote star system well have to launch a probe within the next few hours
fine what about the luminosity studies
that may pose a problem
how so
the flux spectrometers are still down for realignment
i thought they were supposed to be back online yesterday
they were until the stellar dynamics lab decided they needed to install new modules
i recommend we use a gravitron polarimeter it will perform a similar function
make it so mister data
captain i have something id like to report
yes doctor
i heard voices in my room last night i was alone so at first i thought i was imagining things but this morning ten other people reported hearing them at the same time i did
what were the voices saying
i couldnt make them out
data did the sensors pick up anything unusual last night
no anomalous readings were reported
when were through here recheck the sensor logs
aye sir

i sensed nothing unusual last night
maybe its a problem with the comm system

now that you mention it i think i have
do you recall when
no i dont
weve had this discussion before and i know ive given you this examination lets check the medical logs youve been treated several times for headaches related to your visor but i read no mention of dizziness
must be dj vu
both of us about the same thing


crusher to captain picard
yes doctor
do you have a minute jeanluc

my aunt adele cured a lot of sleepless nights with this steamed milk
thank you mmm nutmeg
whenever i get insomnia i try to perfect the recipe
it was the eeriest feeling when the glass broke it triggered the sensation even more intensely that id done it all before
you know earlier i was reading this book and i had the distinct feeling id read certain paragraphs before but i assumed id read the book years ago and id forgotten
ive had this feeling for hours and then the voices
well it could be nothing more than the result of a sleepless night but lets be sure have data and geordi run a shipwide diagnostic concentrating on the time and place you heard the voices and well discuss the results tomorrow at seven hundred hours
thank you for everything
thank aunt adele

wait crusher to sickbay

sickbay here
is commander la forge there
no doctor hes not wait a minute he just came in

you wanted to see me doctor
yes captain have you been getting the feeling that youve experienced certain things before a sense of repetition
yes recently while i was reading why do you ask
there have been similar incidents reported all over the ship feelings of dj vu i had a premonition geordi was going to come in to sickbay a few seconds later he did with the symptoms of an ear infection i was going to run the standard tests but somehow i had a feeling they would turn out negative so i ran an optical diagnostic which traced the problem to geordis visor his dizziness is being caused by a phase shift in his visual receptors its causing him to see images that arent there
theyre like blurry afterimages
i ran a scan to see if i could detect what he was seeing i picked up miniscule distortions in the surrounding dekyon field somehow his visor is translating those distortions into visual impulses
it could be a malfunction in the ships warp field generator ill check it out
run a localised subspace scan to look for anything else
aye sir

keep me advised


crusher to commander la forge
la forge here
geordi i just heard what sounded like voices in my room but no one else is here
sensors just picked up something strange too were checking it out
im on my way


looks like you managed to record six point two seconds worth lets see if we can filter the signal and clear it up a little bit
then i wasnt just hearing things
the sound itself appears to have been real however the acoustic energy does not correspond to any ships system nor to any voice communications sent at the time you heard it
then where did the sound come from
you heard the voices at the same time our localised subspace scan picked up a dekyon field distortion the two may be related lets give another listen
computer perform a narrow bandwidth analysis eliminate all nonvocal waveform components
can we isolate the voices find out what theyre saying
computer continuous playback please there are approximately one thousand voices overlapping the voices are those of the enterprise crew our voices

im sorry to call you here so early but we couldnt wait until oh seven hundred hours we think we may have an explanation for the odd occurrences around here commander
this is going to sound pretty wild somehow weve entered what seems to be a temporal causality loop we think were stuck in a particular fragment in time and weve been repeating that same fragment over and over again
is this whats causing our dj vu
yes but its more than that in dj vu you only think youre repeating events we actually are
our theory is this every time the loop begins again everything resets itself and starts all over we dont remember anything that happened before so each time through the loop we think its the first
you mean we could have come into this room sat at this table and had this conversation a dozen times already
a dozen a hundred its impossible to tell we could have been trapped here for hours days maybe years
if what were saying is true those voices i heard might have been echoes from previous loops
its the same thing with the phase shift in my visor afterimages in time
if youre right about this how did it happen how did we get there
i have a hypothesis that may explain that captain i have analysed the recording doctor crusher made most of it is quite ordinary one hundred fifty discussions about ship operations two hundred fifty two conversations of a personal nature five couples engaged in romantic encounters
your point mister data
there is evidence of some sort of disaster aboard the enterprise severe enough that the captain ordered all hands to abandon ship i have isolated three segments of the recording that are crucial
a highly localised distortion of the spacetime continuum
collision course impact in thirty six seconds
all hands abandon ship repeat all hands abandon
worf refers to a distortion if this were a temporal distortion and if we were close enough to it its possible that a large enough explosion mightve ruptured the spacetime continuum we collided exploded then got stuck in this repeating loop of time
if youre right perhaps we could escape the loop by avoiding the collision
thats our guess
maybe we should reverse course
for all we know reversing course may be what leads us into the crash
no we cant afford to start second guessing ourselves well stay on this course until we have reason to change it but lets do everything we can to avoid the collision
captain we might not be able to figure out how to avoid this accident until its too late and if the loop begins again well forget everything weve learned this time around
what do you suggest
if we do find a way to avoid this collision we should try to send that information into the next loop
is that possible
we have seen that echoes or afterimages from previous loops appear as distortions in the dekyon field we may be able to send a deliberate echo into the next loop
like a message in a bottle
exactly we could enhance a dekyon emission to create a specific pattern and send ourselves a message not a long one probably only a few characters maybe one word
how do we know well pick up that word the next time through
if the dekyon emission is modulated correctly it will set up resonances in my positronic subprocessors i will receive the information on what you would call a subconscious level
now theres the catch we have no way of knowing how this information will be perceived by data it might be like a posthypnotic suggestion
even with all these uncertainties weve got to try take whatever steps are necessary to send a message dismissed


you know its possible weve tried this a thousand times and its never worked
do you have a feeling that youve done this before
no i dont
neither do i maybe thats a good sign
lets test the emitter
particle accelerators at full power
dekyon field active particle flux nominal were in business
all we need now is a message
senior officers report to the bridge

weve got to figure out how weve handled this before

im on my way

at first i thought the catwalk was spinning as it turns out it was me i was lucky ensign fletcher was there to grab me its a long way down to the bottom of the warp core
you have all the symptoms of an inner ear infection that would explain the headaches dizziness but i dont see any physical
what what is it
geordi have you ever had these symptoms before
now that you mention it i think i have
do you recall when
no i dont
i know weve had this discussion before and i remember giving you this examination lets check the medical logs youve been treated several times for headaches related to your visor but theres no mention of dizziness
must be dj vu
both of us about the same thing id like to run an optical diagnostic
for an ear infection
i have a hunch hold still this pulse may be a little bright have you made any changes to your visor lately
no why
im detecting a small phase shift in your visual receptors


crusher to captain picard
yes doctor
can you come to sickbay immediately its urgent
im on my way

his dizziness is being caused by a phase shift in his visual receptors its causing him to see things that arent there
theyre like blurry afterimages
i ran a scan to see if i could detect what he was seeing i picked up miniscule distortions in the surrounding dekyon field his visor seems to be translating those distortions into visual impulses
could be a malfunction in the ships warp field generator ill check it out
while youre at it run a localised subspace scan to look for anything unusual
aye sir
keep me advised doctor

lateral sensors online subspace scanners active data would you run a level two diagnostic on the warp subsystems
certainly

all threes that cant be right
i have encountered the numeral three an inordinate number of times over the last two hours
we have got a dekyon field fluctuation on deck nine section twenty eight
crusher to commander la forge
la forge here
i just heard what sounded like voices in my room but theres no one here
sensors just picked up something strange too were checking it out
im on my way down

doctor crusher are you all right
im fine

i have isolated three segments of this recording that are crucial
a highly localised distortion of the spacetime continuum
collision course impact in thirty six seconds
all hands abandon ship repeat all hands abandon
worf refers to a distortion if this were a temporal distortion and if we were close enough to it its possible that a large enough explosion mightve ruptured the space time continuum we collided exploded then got stuck in this repeating loop of time
if youre right about this then perhaps we can escape the loop by avoiding the collision
thats our guess
perhaps we should reverse course
for all we know reversing course might be what leads us into the crash
we cant afford to start second guessing ourselves we should stay on this course until we have reason to change it but in the meantime i think we should do what we can to avoid a collision
captain weve been seeing the number three all over the ship on consoles in a poker game
to date we have encountered two thousand eighty five conspicuous examples of the number three
all of these threes cant be coming up by accident
maybe somebodys trying to tell us something
we came to the same conclusion so we ran a shipwide diagnostic the only unusual thing we found was a dekyon field modulation in datas positronic subprocessors
what could be causing it
i dont know but if i wanted to send information from one loop to the next i might use a method like a dekyon emission
you think we sent ourselves a message
it would make sense maybe we are trying to tell ourselves something
if that were true what could three indicate
maybe we should run a level three diagnostic on all key systems
its a good idea ill have the computer run a pattern matching algorithm based on the number three

the tractor beam will not be successful i am decompressing the main shuttlebay

we are clear of the distortion
data what happened
at the last moment i speculated that three might refer to the number of rank insignia on commander rikers uniform that indicated to me that his suggestion might be the correct course of action
data you must have picked up a message we sent from the last loop and stacked the deck in the poker game without realising it
that is possible i may also have been inadvertently responsible for the unexplained appearances of the number three
mister worf end red alert and try to access a federation time base beacon lets see if we can find out how long weve been in this causality loop
time base confirms our chronometers are off by seventeen point four days
reset them mister data
aye sir
captain we are being hailed by the other vessel the computer identifies it as the uss bozeman a federation starship soyuz class
soyuz class they havent been in service in over eighty years
open a channel
this is captain morgan bateson of the federation starship bozeman can we render assistance
im captain jeanluc picard of the federation starship enterprise we were just going to ask you the same thing
captain picard your vessel is not familiar to us
captain have you any idea what has just happened
our sensors detected a temporal distortion then your ship appeared we nearly hit you
the enterprise has been caught in temporal causality loop and i suspect that something similar may have happened to you
you must be mistaken we left starbase only three weeks ago
captain do you know what year this is
of course i do its twenty two seventy eight
perhaps you should beam aboard our ship theres something we need to discuss
the first duty

captains log stardate  we are en route to earth where it will be my pleasant duty to deliver this years commencement address at starfleet academy im also looking forward to seeing wesley crusher again his flight team will perform a demonstration near saturn that will be transmitted to the graduation ceremonies

captain starfleet academy is requesting an update on our estimated arrival
mister data
we should be arriving at earth in ten hours sixteen minutes sir
please inform the academy mister worf and send my regards to superintendant brand
aye sir
do you know admiral brand
weve met a few times shes a formidable woman
sounds like my superintendent when i was at the academy we had a vulcan superintendent who had memorised the personnel files of every single cadet he knew everything about them it was like having your parents around all the time
my superintendent was a betazoid a full telepath when he sent for you to his office he didnt have to ask what youd done
you got called into the superintendents office thats a story id like to hear
sir we are being hailed again by the academy it is admiral brand
on screen
sir she is requesting a private channel
in my ready room

admiral brand what can i do for you
hello captain i know youre a close friend of the crusher family
yes
i wanted to inform you personally theres been an accident

he had second degree burns on his chest and multiple fractures of his right arm but hes going to be fine

have they completed the regeneration series
im not certain
wesleys allergic to metorapan treatments i think theyll have to use a bicaridine substitute i should send his complete records to the academy infirmary of course they probably have them already but you cant be too sure
beverly hes fine
i know hes fine i know hes fine how did it happen
apparently his squadron was practicing on the academy flight range near saturn they were flying a close formation there was a collision all five ships were destroyed four of the cadets managed to transport out one didnt make it
do you know who it was
yes his name was joshua albert
wesley spoke of him they were friends wesley was so excited to make the flight team of course i was a little nervous but i was proud of him i always knew there was a chance that something like this might
beverly wesleys alive and hes well


there was very little left to salvage from the wreckage we did recover one of the ships data recorders but it was badly damaged were attempting to restore the information but that will take some time standard procedure calls for an immediate investigation by two command level officers captain satelk and i will be taking depositions from nova squadron at fifteen hundred hours today commander albert im sure that everyone in this room joins me in expressing my deepest sympathies to you on the tragic loss of your son there will be a memorial service for cadet albert this evening in the west garden it has been suggested that we should cancel the graduation ceremonies in the light of whats happened commander albert and i have discussed this and weve agreed that commencement should go forward as planned the cadets should know that even after a tragedy like this there are still duties to perform and life continues thank you all for coming

its good to see you again captain i wish it were under better circumstances
this is an unhappy way to begin commencement if you require any assistance then the enterprise is at your disposal
im sure well be able to conduct the investigation but thank you for your offer


wes i was so worried about you
how are you feeling wesley
not bad the arms a little sore
we were very sorry to hear about joshua
would you like to talk about it
no i dont think so no thank you i know youre trying to be helpful sir but it seems like thats all ive talked about for the last two days i dont want to go through it again
i understand but i just want you to know im available if you should change your mind
thank you sir

hi
hi

captain sir
at ease cadet
this is my squadron leader nicholas locarno this is captain jeanluc picard of the enterprise my mother doctor beverly crusher
hello doctor
hello
captain picard
mister locarno
i came by to see if wes had healed up all right
and how are you feeling nicholas
im okay i just never lost anyone under my command before
im afraid that never gets easier
captain mom will you excuse us please nick and i have some things we need to talk about
of course let me know if you need anything
i will
ill see you at the inquiry good to meet you mister locarno
you too sir

the inquiry is scheduled for fifteen hundred hours are you ready
i think so
dont worry about it wes everythings going to be all right so long as we stick together


hey cant you see thats a flower bed
sorry im really sorry

boothby jeanluc picard class of twenty seven
i know that what happened to your hair
how are you
im pretty damned cranky thank you ive already replanted this bed four times this week
let me give you a hand
you
ive acquired an interest over the years
well dont plant em too deep the stems
will rot
captain picard of the enterprise no less and giving the commencement address
you sound surprised
surprised uh uh nothing you ever did surprised me son except that time you caught that ligonian with a reverse body lift and pinned him in the first fourteen seconds of the match didnt think you had it in you
well it was all in the legs all that running i did boothby
hmmm
i dont think i ever i dont think i ever told you how much i appreciate
theres nothing to tell

yes there is i just wanted to while i was here look you know as well as i do i would never have graduated if you
you made a mistake there isnt a man among us who hasnt been young enough to make one
nevertheless
you did what you had to do you did what you thought was best i just made sure that you listened to yourself
at the time i thought you were a meanspirited vicious old man
i was and by the way i was about the same age you are now
i didnt speak to you for months
you needed to get your bearings i knew that the important thing is what you did with your life afterwards seems you did okay thats thanks enough for me
did you know the boy from nova squadron who was killed
josh albert yeah crusher hajar sito locarno i know them all


you nervous
 no yes
thats okay so am i but were going to be all right weve got some tough times ahead but weve always come through for each other whatever happens i want you all to know that leading this team has been the high point of my years at the academy no one could have asked for a better team or better friends lets go


at this point we accelerated and executed a starboard turn of twenty seven degrees we came out of the turn on course for titan
and you were still in the lead position
yes sir
continue
as we entered titans gravitational sphere i gave the signal to tighten up and move into a diamond slot formation remaining in the diamond formation we executed a low apogee turn around titan then began a zplus twenty five degree climb in preparation for a yeager loop

approximately nine seconds later cadet alberts ship collided with cadet hajars we had less than two seconds to activate our emergency transporters and beam to the evac stations at mimas everyone made it except josh
thank you mister locarno cadet hajar

as team navigator you filed a flight plan with the academy range officer before the exercise correct
yes sir
did nova squadron deviate from that flight plan after you entered the saturn range
no sir
then how do you explain the fact that the low apogee turn around titan was at least two thousand kilometres closer to the moon than indicated in your plan
we were still within flight safety parameters sir
that was not my question cadet
we had discussed changing our approach after i filed the flight plan the final decision was made en route to saturn i didnt consider it significant enough to mention here i apologise for the confusion sir i should have been more precise
 did you see mister alberts ship break formation before it collided with your ship
no sir my first indications of trouble was when my proximity alarm went off
you may be seated did any of you see the collision take place
no sir
cadet sito you were in the tail position therefore you should have seen any sign of trouble from cadet albert yet you saw nothing
that is correct sir
did your attention falter
no sir i was flying solely on sensor readings at the time i did not have any visual contact with cadet alberts ship when he broke formation
sensor readings

whats wrong
well its unusual to fly on sensors alone in this type of manoeuvre the pilot relies on visual clues from the other ships to maintain formation
if you were flying on sensors alone perhaps you could tell us the orientation of his ship before the collision
i dont know sir
you were flying a ship travelling eighty thousand kph with cadet alberts ship less than ten metres away and you dont know what his orientation was
i dont remember sir
sir may i
go ahead
admiral josh was a good pilot but lately hed been having difficulties hed get nervous during close flybys and pull away in the final seconds his formation flying was a little erratic
and you didnt report this to anyone
no sir i didnt wed flown together a long time i thought he could handle it if i gave him a chance i was wrong
then you are saying that the accident was cadet alberts fault
i think josh got frightened and tried to pull out of the turn prematurely and then crashed into cadet hajar josh was our friend we didnt want him to be remembered as someone who panicked
please be seated im very disturbed by what ive heard here today by your own admission you allowed your teammate to fly when you knew he was having difficulties maintaining formation that demonstrates a serious lack of judgment i am also disturbed by the fact that you did not come forward with this information immediately we should have the first data from mister crushers flight recorder tonight we will reconvene at thirteen hundred hours tomorrow
everythings fine trust me


i dont know captain the academy has one of the best reconstructive analysis labs in starfleet im not sure theres much we could contribute to the investigation
yes that may well be but wesleys one of our own
understood sir well get right on it
good ive spoken with admiral brand and shes agreed to allow us access to all of the physical evidence and testimony thank you gentlemen

you shouldnt have said it nick josh wasnt responsible for what happened
i had to do something
you said we wouldnt have to lie to them we all agreed not to lie to them
i didnt lie everything i said was the truth
the accident was not joshs fault
look he was my friend too wes i worked to get him on this team but the truth is he panicked
we dont know that
of course we do none of us has wanted to say it out loud but weve all had the same thought havent we
he must have pulled away too soon i think he got scared
sito

wes i know you want to protect his memory we all do but we have to look out for ourselves now what do you want us to do walk in and tell them everything that happened
we might as well turn in our uniforms and start packing our bags
are we ready for that well take this one step at a time this is the preliminary report from your flight recorder it was so badly damaged in the crash that the lab could only retrieve a third of the total telemetry on the recorder and all of it is before the collision theres no problem here
i dont know if i can do this nick
you dont have to lie just dont volunteer any new information
the first night i met you wes i knew i wanted you on this squad you more than any of the rest would understand what it means to be able to count on someone because youve been out there putting yourself on the line you know youve got to be able to count on the people on your team because your life is in their hands and their lives are in yours we made a promise to each other right in the beginning that wed stick together we were nova squadron nobody else could say that and even after we graduated wed try to get posted to the same duty we were going to be a team for a long time josh cant be a part of those plans anymore but i think he would still want us to be a team what do you think


mister crusher
sir
at ease am i interrupting
no i was just going over my deposition for tomorrow
they told me youd be here i found this in joshs room i think it belongs to you
our ski trip josh and i went to calgary last month he forgot his sweater so he borrowed one of mine
he told me you helped him with his classes
a little he only needed help in statistical mechanics
if josh had a weakness it was mathematics
no he could do it he just didnt like to
his mother and i thought hed never get out of calculus then he found out what the academy entrance requirements were like that turned him around he stayed after class got a tutor he really worked hard never gave up on anything and he had a lot of respect for you and everybody on the team i realise it was his fault that everybody could have been killed and i want to say that i want to say im sorry im sorry that he let you down


are you ready mister crusher
yes sir this is the beginning of our run toward titan im on the right wing
where is mister albert at this point
he was on my port quarter approximately fifty metres away weve just received the signal to begin the diamond slot formation thats cadet locarno coming into view were in a twenty degree turn around titan we should be coming out of titans gravity well about now
that is the extent of the data we were able to recover from the flight recorder mister crusher would you describe what happened after you left orbit of titan
once we cleared the moon mister locarno led us into a yeager loop approximately nine seconds later my proximity alarm went off i tried to veer away but it was too late and i was hit i lost control of my ship a power coupling exploded in my cockpit i dont know how but i managed to activate my escape transporter and the next thing i remember is finding myself on the emergency evac station on mimas with the rest of the squadron except josh
do you have anything to add to your testimony
no sir
mister crusher will you describe a yeager loop
the ships begin in a diamond slot formation and climb and loop backwards at a steep angle and at the peak of the loop turn over and accelerate in a new direction
mister crusher did your team remain in formation throughout the loop
yes sir
i want you to be absolutely clear on this point mister crusher before the collision was nova squadron in a diamond slot formation
yes sir
computer display saturn navcon file six dash three seven nine these images were obtained by a navigational control satellite in orbit around saturn during a standard sensor sweep computer freeze image magnify sector gamma three and enhance

this image was recorded when your ships moved briefly into the satellites sensor range according to the time index what you see on the monitor took place seven seconds after nova squadron completed the yeager loop
mister crusher are these ships in a diamond slot formation
no sir
what is your explanation mister crusher
i have none sir

everythings going to be okay wesley there must be an explanation for all this data and geordi are already analysing the flight recorder and the satellite transmission
why
there must be something wrong with the satellite data it might have been tampered with
mom
well there must be some explanation for this i know youre telling the truth but the satellite data made it look as if you were lying ive spoken with the other parents i am going to talk to admiral brand and ask her to delay the inquiry
mom dont you cant do that
im not going to let them ruin your career wesley you havent done anything wrong
mom dont try to protect me please stay out of this


these weeds keep popping up in the pittosporum poor plants dont have a chance to grow
you could use a good herbicide instead of pulling the weeds with your bare hands
and you could explore space on a holodeck instead of a starship
boothby tell me some more about nova squadron
not going well is it
no it isnt
do you remember the parrises squares tournament of twenty four
the final game against minsk
it took me three weeks to repair the grounds after the celebration
we had a lot to celebrate our team wasnt supposed to win we were very proud of them
well the cadets today are just as proud of the nova squadron the celebration they held after nova won the rigel cup made twenty four look like a dinner party to the other cadets the members of that team are gods and thats a hard image to live up to but nick locarno he watches out for them he keeps them together nick is what makes that team special hes their coach surrogate father and best friend all in one a natural leader the members of that team love him if he asks them to do something they do it even if it means going right over a cliff


report
nothing conclusive we do know that the collision occurred about four seconds after the satellite images were recorded but we still dont know how the ships got into the new formation or why the crash occurred
we unsuccessfully tried fifty three different computational models in an effort to simulate the movements of the nova squadron just prior to the crash
therere just too many variables to take into consideration speed attitude course
did wesleys flight recorder indicate that there was anything unusual about the ship or the way it was operating
the starboard power flow was fluctuating
however it was well within operational limits
fluidic pressure in the landing struts was low but i dont know what difference that would make
we did find that wesley opened his coolant interlock just before beginning the manoeuvre around titan
that is a bit unusual normally the interlock is closed unless youre performing a check on the engine coolant levels but theres no evidence wesley was performing that sort of check
filling the primary coolant tanks requires an open interlock but that can only be performed in a maintenance bay is there any other reason for opening the valve
its the first step in purging the plasma exhaust
that procedure would be extremely hazardous while the ship was in flight
yeah the engine would probably ignite the plasma
ignite the plasma thats exactly what they were trying to do

come
captain
can you tell me what manoeuvre this is

its a kolvoord starburst sir
five ships crossing within ten metres of each other and igniting their plasma trails one of the most spectacular and difficult demonstrations of precision flying it hasnt been performed at the academy team in over a hundred years do you know why
it was banned by the academy following a training accident sir
an accident in which all five cadets lost their lives i think that nicholas locarno wanted to end his academy career in a blaze of glory that he convinced the four of you to learn the kolvoord starburst for the commencement demonstration if it worked you would thrill the assembled guests and locarno would graduate as a living legend only it didnt work and joshua albert paid the price am i correct cadet i asked you a question am i correct
i choose not to answer sir
you choose not to answer but youve already given an answer to the inquiry and that answer was a lie
i said the accident occurred after the loop it did
what you neglected to mention was that following the loop your team attempted a manoeuvre that was the direct cause of the crash you told the truth up to a point but a lie of omission is still a lie do you remember the day you first came aboard this ship your mother brought you on the bridge
yes
you even sat in my chair i was annoyed presumptuous child playing on my ship but i never forgot how you already knew every control every display you behaved as though you belonged on the bridge and then later when i decided to make you an acting ensign i was convinced you could be an outstanding officer ive never questioned that conviction until now the first duty of every starfleet officer is to the truth whether its scientific truth or historical truth or personal truth it is the guiding principle upon which starfleet is based if you cant find it within yourself to stand up and tell the truth about what happened you dont deserve to wear that uniform im going to make this simple for you mister crusher either you come forward and tell admiral brand what really took place or i will
captain
dismissed

your message said it was urgent
they know nick they know what we did
calm down calm down now tell me exactly what happened
captain picard called me to the enterprise when i got there he told me that he knows the kolvoord manoeuvre the cover up everything he said that if i didnt come forward and tell the truth now he would
you said hed figured it out does he have any evidence
no but he knew exactly how it happened
captain picard doesnt know anything he has a theory so let him tell the inquiry what he thinks happened theyll ask us is it true well say no sir theres no evidence so theres no case well get off with a reprimand
i cant call captain picard a liar
wesley we have to hang on just a little longer then this will all be over
its wrong nick
wesley
no im going to tell them what happened
youre going to tell them what happened you alone are going to decide what happens to me to sito to jean youre going to decide that
im not going to lie to them again nick i cant live with it
you cant lie to them you cant live with this you have to tell them what happened who the hell are you
nick
youre going to turn us in
now wait a minute
no you wait a minute he got to you didnt he picard told you some big story about duty and honour it mustve been a pretty good speech to make you turn your back on your friends
were starfleet cadets we have a duty to the truth
what about your duty to your friends i got you on this team i gave you a chance when there were upperclassmen waiting in line i said he wont let us down he was on the enterprise he knows what its like to trust somebody with his life i guess i was wrong
if we all come forward together and tell admiral brand
we dont want to come forward sito jean and me we dont have a problem with this but if you do then resign your appointment to the academy and walk away dont make us pay for your guilty conscience
youd let me do that youd let me throw my career away just to save your neck
to save the team thats more important than you and its more important than me and if i was in your place id do it without hesitation but thats me

captain satelk and i have gone over your testimony and the physical evidence from the crash your statements cannot be reconciled with the data collected from the navcon satellite your unwillingness to offer any explanation for this contradiction is disappointing and raises suspicion we cannot escape the conclusion that either the data is faulty in some way or you have lied to us however suspicion is not proof and i have no proof that you have lied to this inquiry therefore if no further evidence is presented i have no choice but to close this investigation for filing an inaccurate flight plan and for allowing cadet albert to fly when you knew he was having difficulties i am ordering a formal reprimand placed on each of your permanent records i am also revoking your flight privileges this inquiry is closed
sir i would like to add something to my testimony
proceed mister crusher
yesterday i testified that the crash occurred following a yeager loop that is not entirely true we performed a loop and afterwards broke formation and attempted a kolvoord starburst we knew it was prohibited we knew it was dangerous but we wanted to do something spectacular for the commencement demonstration we pushed josh into it and he wasnt ready we thought we could do it we thought we could do anything we were wrong and josh died josh didnt let us down sir it wasnt his fault
mister locarno you are the leader of nova squadron do you have anything to say mister locarno
no sir

mister locarno has been expelled
they shouldve expelled all of us
they very nearly did mister locarno made an impassioned plea for the rest of you he said that hed used his influence as squadron leader to convince you to attempt the kolvoord manoeuvre and then to cover up the truth he asked to take full responsibility
he did exactly what he said he would he protected the team i feel awful ive let down everyone my mother my friends you
you should feel bad and you will pay for what youve done admiral brand has decided that in addition to a formal reprimand your academic credits for the past year will be cancelled and you will not advance with your class
i understand
its not going to be easy staying here on campus everyone knowing what you did you have difficult times ahead
yes sir thank you captain
you knew what you had to do i just made sure you listened to yourself goodbye cadet
goodbye captain
cost of living



forward tubes armed and ready captain
fire
a direct hit sir
the asteroid has shattered however the core is still intact and still on a collision course with tessen three
is it big enough to cause a threat
yes sir it is of sufficient size and density to cause planetwide damage
time to impact
it will reach the upper atmosphere in forty four seconds and impact on the planet eleven seconds later
ready torpedoes
aye sir
sir the core is composed of nitrium and chrondite it is unlikely another photon torpedo will be of any effect
mister worf prepare a tractor beam
aye sir
thirty seconds to impact
captain i am unable to get a positive lock with the tractor beam there is magnetic field interference emanating from the core materials
activate a deflector dish if we project a particle beam we may be able to produce a disruptive nuclear effect within the core
aye sir
impact in seventeen seconds
particle beam activated the target has been destroyed captain
the remaining debris is of no threat to the planet sir
well done everyone  ensign put us back on course for the moselina system warp four as soon as were clear of the debris field
aye sir



my instructions were clear
they were not
before he was allowed to play he was to place his soiled clothing in the garment reprocessor
i was not
i sense a touch of hostility here gentlemen
you were specifically told that
you told me that yesterday not today
if i may suggest
you know very well the same rules apply today that
please why not simply draw up a contract which clearly defines the duties of each family member
you mean he tells me what he wants and i have to do it
no i means you both agree to your responsibilities and when youve done the things that youve agreed to do then youve earned the privilege to doing the things that you want to do when hes cleaned his room for instance then perhaps hes earned a visit to the holodeck to fight his alien monsters
you suggest bribery
i suggest working out an equitable system with the rules clearly spelled out for the child and the parent you must make a list of your responsibilities too what would you like your father to promise alexander
no yelling
i do  i do not yell
well then you should have no trouble with that part why not go back to your quarters and talk this thing over decide on which points each of you wants in the contract
very well
one day youll learn to be glad your father cared enough about you to insist on rules it may be hard to imagine right now but eventually most children come to appreciate their parents

riker to counsellor troi your mothers just come aboard
on the other hand
deanna my dear its mother

oh ive got such deliciously exciting news youre going to be absolutely thrilled im getting married

you know with just a bit of redecorating here and there this ten forward room should make a very nice wedding hall
i beg your pardon
where else my little one but here amongst all my good friends and in the presence of my adored daughter
mother where did you when did you meet this man who is he i mean marriage when did all this happen
my poor plodding little deanna with her questions questions questions wherever did you inherit such pedestrian genes what matters my little one is that your mothers happy
mother if youre happy then im happy for you i only asked who he is and where you met him those are not unusual questions
hes such a wonderful man and he has such good breeding i tell you hes absolute perfection
who is he
hes campio third minister to the conference of judges on the planet kostolain royalty my little one naturally
naturally i didnt know youd ever been to kostolain or was he on some diplomatic mission to betazed
well neither actually you see we havent exactly met yet really oh but the profiles weve exchanged why theyre in such accord that you could weep my little one you would weep at the harmony between us
mother dont you think it would be a good idea if you actually met the man youre going to marry before committing to spend the rest of your life with him
deanna i love you but you do make everything sound like an epitaph

i dont want to agree
but you have to agree that is what an agreement is counsellor troi excuse the intrusion but were having some difficulty drawing up our contract mrs troi
hes not fair
the boy is unreasonable
well of course hes unreasonable hes a child and such a child you know making little boys reasonable only gives them pimples
alexander this is my mother
alexander what a wonderful name you know i once knew a tall handsome warrior named alexander oh he utterly adored me we went everywhere simply everywhere have you been anywhere yet contract what contract
between father and son a fair and balanced way to achieve a mutual sense of order
well how ghastly for you and youre doing this to your own child mister woof
mother
it is worf madam
contracts are usually between people who dont really trust one another a child who is trusted becomes worthy of that trust
mother will you kindly stay out of this
and if he does not perform his contractual duties i assume he will be chastised
he will be sanctioned yes
and if you fail to perform your duties what is the child supposed to do about it
mother will you please
i not perform my duty
alexander now lifes true gift is the capacity to enjoy enjoyment now have i arrived too late or can you still smile

married shes getting married
yes if we stay on our present course we should rendezvous with her intended groom in thirty one hours
i will not continue have that woman continuing to use this ship for her convenience simply because her daughter happens to be one of my officers
apparently deanna being on board is only part of the reason
the other reason being
she thinks the honour of giving away the bride should fall on you
permission for an onboard wedding is granted number one nothing would please me more than to give away mrs troi



ah my little warrior and how are you this morning oh i see being punished for something are we
its just my regular time to meet with counsellor troi shes not here yet
then youre early thats very responsible of you
no i just wanted to be out of my room before
before what now if were to be real friends weve got to share only the truth
why
well for one thing its easier when you tell the truth you never have to remember later what you lied about but mostly a true friend is a person you can always tell the truth to without worrying about it
i wanted to leave before my father got back
oh
i hate him i wish my mother was here but she died
thats not very fair is it
all he cares about are rules im supposed to do everything right all the time i dont know how
to tell you the truth little warrior neither do i but i do know one marvellous thing we can do with rules
im supposed to wait for counsellor troi
exactly

ill bet youve never been to a colony of free spirits
what do they do there
whatever they want artists philosophers free thinkers and people who dont quite fit other peoples rules personally i come for the mud baths you oh youre going to adore the mud baths computer im assuming you have the parallax colony of shiralea vi
that programme is available
oh good then run it for us dear


whats that
a wind dancer he stands guard you see only those whose hearts are joyous may enter come on

fire sculptor well chat with her later if youre not wearing anything flammable
hello a few of us were just gathering together for our laughing hour would you care to come laugh with us
actually we were about to experience a mud bath
were you what an idea my friends and i will join you one can always laugh in the bath
do you ever drop one
oh no no no these are my worlds i protect them i am a master of worlds and they fly only as i wish  were having guests for laughing hour would you care to join us
wed love to 
no thank you
yes
no
why do you always say no when i say yes
i dont
you just did
there you go again you are the most negative person
why are they arguing
theyre friends they love contradiction they thrive on challenge they flourish in conflict
then why are they friends
who else are you going to fight with if not your friends
hold what is the lesson for today
damned if we know were just here for some fun and a mud bath
every moment requires a purpose
no it doesnt
every purpose requires a plan
he does this every day usually while everybodys food gets cold its rather boring
the higher the fewer
well thats a conversation stopper if i ever heard one
i am not
yes you are
i am not
excuse me if youre going to argue you should remember the higher the fewer
so my little warrior wants to see more in life than just fighting the mind opens and in creeps wisdom


alexander be patient she says  come i cant believe this

isnt alexander supposed to be with you
he didnt show up for his appointment i assumed he must still be here
computer what is the location of alexander rozhenko
alexander rozhenko is in holodeck two
is he there alone
he is with lwaxana troi


to all the creatures within us
all the creatures within us
of course every one of us has a thousand different kinds of tiny people inside of us and some of them want to get out and be wild some want to be sad or happy or inventive or even just go dancing thats why we all have so many different urges at different times and all those different little people inside us we must never be afraid to take them with us wherever we go i mean who knows when we may need one of them to pop up and rescue us from ourselves variety my little alex the great secret is not the variety of life its the variety of us
are we ready for the entertainment
yes bring on the entertainment

mother
little one mister woof come join us

mother im trying to help the boy learn the value of responsibility youre not helping by giving him a lot of mixed messages
i exposed you to all sorts of mixed messages when you were that age you still turned out deadly dull what are you so worried about
among other things his relationship with his father no more holodeck mother please and why arent you all absorbed in your wedding plans its only three days away
im letting mister homn take care of all the mundane details he knows my tastes
mother
deanna theres absolutely nothing to do you nosey little girl campios already sent me his mothers wedding gown which mister homn is now altering for me outside of that there really isnt anything else
wedding gown mother stop youre telling me youre not going to be naked at your own wedding
campio is from a different planet with different traditions he would not approve of a traditional betazoid wedding so i am happily adapting now its as simple as that i need some tea
i cant believe im hearing this from the heir to the holy rings of betazed holder of the sacred chalice of rixx
oh why cant i ever work this replicator
mother i think its time you tell me about this mysterious marriage to a man youve never met
computer some jestral tea please anyway why shouldnt i get married if i choose to you make everything into such a mystery there is no mystery deanna except about this petrokian sausage  the tea all i wanted was a cup of tea oh dear i think your replicators having a nervous collapse

a levelfour diagnostic of the food replication systems has failed to detect any faults in the orientation terminals
that may be but weve still got over two hundred reports of malfunctioning replicators
there is an energy fluctuation in one of the utility access corridors
well wed better look into it whatever it is before the captain decides to order dinner

yeah dash six four here we are some kind of intermittent em field pattern give me a hand with that will you data theres no plasma leakage just a little negative ion charging



bad enough having to wear anything at my own wedding but this perhaps if we lower the bodice raise the hemline then what a constant joy you are

mister homn

alexander my little warrior come here come on give me a great big hug now youre not escaping another appointment are you
no maam
well i suppose eventually we all have to live up to our obligations well now tell me what brings you here to brighten my day
i wanted to say im sorry if i got you in any trouble
thats very sweet dear but i really wasnt in any trouble until i saw this dress ugly isnt it
whats it for
im getting married
why
are you sure my daughter didnt send you just a joke people get married because they want to spend their lives with someone
their whole life they must have to like that person a lot
well if youre young and lucky itll be someone you like a lot yes and if youre older
are you very old
im alone alex and when you do get older and can no longer pick and choose from whatever may come your way then you do what we call compromise it keeps you from being afraid

we have traced the failure to a data net interface which routes replicator selections to the correct subprocessors
when we opened the panel we discovered that the interface had been transformed into a gelatinous material that we havent been able to identify

we have an intermittent failure of the inertial damping system
take us out of warp ensign
primary attitude control has failed going to secondary systems
we have lost helm control sir
try a manual bypass of the damping systems
aye sir
backup generators
coming online now
how long before we regain attitude control
were almost there

ensign put us back on course lets stay at impulse for now
did something hit us mister worf
negative sir
the inertial dampers shouldnt fail without kicking in the automatic bypass i want to know what went wrong analysis in thirty minutes


the same thing that happened to the replicator happened to the stabiliser the transfers in both systems were turned into this
some kind of corrosion
we have not yet identified the substance commander
whatever it is it looks like theres been a conversion process transforming some of the metal into gelatinous residue but what caused it is a mystery
replicators and stabilisers two totally unrelated systems
yes sir and we still dont know why the sensors didnt pick up the problems
lets run a mass spectrometer analysis and find out what this stuff is
transporter room one to captain picard minister campio is beaming on board sir
ill be right there the bridegroom

 ah campio my dear your compatibility profile didnt do you justice i of course am lwaxana and any introductory compliments youd care to make will be happily received
indeed mrs troi you are even lovelier in person
now that worked just fine

now now we dont wish to be too familiar at this early juncture

forgive this tardiness ships business minister campio captain jeanluc picard of the enterprise welcome aboard
 i thank you and greet you with appreciation for permitting this wedding aboard your fine vessel
not at all sir
campio may i present my daughter deanna troi meet well your future stepfather come to think of it
ah yes if i recall the profile you are the ships counsellor
i am sir
and my escort who need not be addressed in this company protocol master erko
campio personally i adore all the ostentation i can get but protocol master
i would not do you nor our benevolent hosts the disservice of failing to ensure that priorities are observed
oh yes how very thoughtful
after all it would be unpardonable to simply abandon ourselves to the moment would it not
unpardonable


well it looks like the only alloy common to both the replicator and the stabiliser is nitrium computer analyze the nitrium content of both the affected stabiliser and replicator
there is no nitrium present in the affected stabiliser or replicator
there is none present in the residue either
according to the mass spectrometer the elements in the residue have been broken down into simpler molecular structures
that would suggest the nitrium has been organically metabolised
maybe thats it data if a living organism ingested the nitrium
this residue would be the waste left behind
if thats true if somethings eating away at the nitrium on the ship that means the dilithium chamber is vulnerable as well as the power transfer conduits wed better get to engineering

ha ha
eat son
ha
what are you doing what is that noise
ha its my laughing hour ha ha
that is enough please it is your dinner hour eat
ha i promised to meet mrs troi for another lesson in happy wisdom ha
will you stop doing that please alexander eat your food wisdom will wait i assure you
i promised should i break my promise father
a klingon ever breaks his word
where are you going
you said no klingon ever breaks his word
i did not mean now now just sit down and eat
i dont understand father youre confusing me
understand later just eat
father the higher the fewer


i dont wish to be authoritative my dear but master erko says that now is our proper time for discussion of certain details
well i certainly dont wish to be considered antierko dear but i did promise alexander one more holodeck trip come along my little love
surely therell be other occasions for you to spend time with the boy
my goodness campio you and i are going to have the rest of our lives ill tell you what ill be back here with you in one hour exactly all right
minister the woman should not be addressing you in the familiar

mother we have to talk
yes we certainly do dear but not just now well how er how do i address him
mother weve come for alexander please forgive the intrusion
preferably he should be called by his ministerial title
ah ill remember oh mister homn you make everybody comfortable until we get back especially the minister here now ill be back one hour darling ill see you then
mrs troi it is alexanders dinner hour
how thoughtless of me i guess well just have to have a little picnic before our mud bath
we have business to deal with here leaving is simply not acceptable
oh well cant we just pretend its acceptable well be back
you are missing the point
alexander you will return to our quarters and have dinner
but were going to go to the holodeck
mother youre undermining every effort were trying to make here
dont be absurd you poor dear dont they ever let you change those colourless outfits
it is essential that we begin a discussion of the wedding procedures now
oh minister darling perhaps you and the jerko here can come with us
lwaxana this exceeds all boundaries
oh well half hour then no longer i promise mister homn your duties
counsellor troi have you no influence
ha
ha
lwaxana if you will remain i may allow the boy to stay
definitely not
definitely not my son is to return to quarters
nor may a servant be present during a prenuptial consultation

well sir im afraid even the bride wont be present for this one

the dilithium chamber shows no anomalous readings
so far these transfer conduits are clean too hold on im getting something here theres a severe energy fluctuation in this access panel



what happened
i was just juggling and i happened to catch one in my mouth it tasted good so i ate it before i knew it id eaten up every one of my worlds it never occurred to me that once they were gone id have nothing left to juggle if you ever have a world plan ahead dont eat it
well now almost time to get back
are you sad
of course not im about to be a bride
you know that man youre going to marry he would never come and take a mud bath would he
oh he might probably not
you know maybe this would be a good time to get one of those little people that live inside of you to come out and tell you what to do or help you or something
alexander what are you talking about
im sorry
no no dont you dare be sorry

whats wrong
come along alexander lets not leave everyone waiting for us

once we saw that photonic trail moving through the wall we realised we must be dealing with a metal parasite of some kind
we believe the parasites came through the ships hull after we destroyed the asteroid near tessen three
are they attacking anything other than nitrium alloy
no sir not that we can tell but weve got nitrium everywhere the computers the life support the ventilation the engines even the dilithium chamber
mister data the asteroid we destroyed that was rich in nitrium
aye sir
and that asteroid came from the pelloris field if the rest of that field is rich in nitrium it would make a natural feeding ground
we should think about going back there the parasites could possibly be lured back to the asteroids for a meal thats more appealing than we are
mister data how long to the field
at warp nine five hours twenty minutes sir
picard to the bridge
riker here sir
set a course for the pelloris asteroid field warp nine
aye sir
captain with our sensors unable to detect the parasites and given the speed with which they appear to be moving through the ship
we may not have five hours and twenty minutes im aware of that how can we slow them down
in several cases an exanogen gas barrier has been known to slow the progress of metal parasites
they dont like cold eh make it so
the problem is finding them as soon as we spot an energy fluctuation theyve already consumed all the nitrium and have moved on

primary power systems are going down ive rerouted to the secondary generators
inform the bridge mister data with me

bridge commander do you have any suggestions on how we could encourage the parasites to leave the ship once we reach the pelloris field
if we reconfigure a particle beam with a high concentration of nitrium and project it toward one of the asteroids
then they would follow the beam like a trail of breadcrumbs very well

turbolift velocity is beginning to fluctuate captain
computer stop at next level computer acknowledge

we have reached the bridge sir

report number one
ventilation and life support are failing at random spots all over the ship
captain weve dropped to warp five point seven
picard to engineering
la forge here
whats happening mister la forge were losing speed

the parasites mustve gotten into the primary warp controllers captain trying to do a bypass patch to isolate the backup controllers but it looks like warp six is about the best im going to be able to give you

at that speed mister la forge there wont be a ship left to reach the pelloris field do what you have to
working on it sir
captain were losing life support on decks eleven and twelve
mister worf have security evacuate all personnel from those decks
aye sir

engineering to bridge weve got warp six point five but i dont know how much more coaxing

we can do here
we need more speed than that commander
the matterantimatter

injectors are failing im rerouting to secondary injector power now watch the antimatter containment for any system failure

atmospheric systems are down twenty seven percent were going below tolerable oxygen limits
we must evacuate decks twenty through twenty four captain
make it so shut down life support to those decks
direct all evacuees to decks nine and ten
divert emergency life support to those decks
aye sir
time to asteroid field
if we maintain our current speed two hours twenty three minutes sir
mister data the rest of us may lose consciousness if we do it will be your job to execute the plan as discussed
aye sir

structural integrity of the dilithium chamber is at thirty four percent estimated breach in one minute
computer transfer power from warp engines to life support
transfer complete
activate bussard collector
activated breach of dilithium chamber in forty seconds
reconfigure hydrogen plasma mixture to include thirty percent nitrium
mixture complete
project emitter beam heading zero two four mark zero four one

structural integrity of the dilithium chamber is at twenty eight percent and holding

mister data
the plan was successful sir
well done mister worf coordinate your teams with doctor crusher and commander la forge assess damage and injury
aye sir
captains log stardate  temporary repairs to the ship have been completed our attention now turns to matters of a more festive nature


 this is intolerable
youd think shed at least get to her own wedding on time

minister minister this is infamous infamous we leave immediately



ah heavenly every pore in my body tingles with contentment isnt it wonderful how things work out alexander i wanted to teach you how to grab the joys of living and you turned around and taught me not to let go of them how very mutual
we still have to learn how to live in the real world mother all of us
shes absolutely right alexander but only when necessary
youre just supposed to sit here
the perfect mate

captains log stardate  in an effort to bring an end to their centurieslong war krios and valt minor have agreed to a ceremony of reconciliation to be held aboard the enterprise at a point midway between their two systems

i apologise for the delay in our arrival ambassador briam we had to stop at harod four to pick up a group of stranded miners
please captain we are grateful that the federation has taken as much interest as it has in this matter
was commander la forge able to provide you with the special cargo handling provisions you requested
indeed he was however until we reach the rendezvous with the valtese may i ask that the cargo bay be declared offlimits to all but the most essential personnel
i trust ambassador that this cargo is in no way dangerous
oh no nothing of the sort im cautious because its quite fragile and quite irreplaceable
bridge to captain picard
go ahead
captain weve just picked up a distress call from a ferengi shuttle
set a course to intercept
aye sir
captain the timing of our ceremony with alrik is critical it cannot be delayed
well be at the rendezvous on schedule dont worry excuse me

the ferengi report their containment field is collapsing
within visual range captain
on screen
their reactor core is unstable captain
how many on board
two sir
bridge to transporter room three boost your output and lock on to the two ferengi on board the shuttle

we may need to attempt a long range transport
standing by


energise


got them sir


mister worf escort our ferengi guests to quarters not too close to mine
understood

unless you can arrange your own transport you will have to remain on the enterprise until we complete our mission
that will not be a problem
we are in no hurry
we look forward to enjoying the comforts of your fine ship

quite acceptable not what were used to you understand but it will do
perhaps your captain would care to invite us to join him for dinner this evening
the captain dines alone

a pity that was too easy

weve been working from your drawings ambassador i hope were in the ballpark
ball park
thats an old human expression mister laforge hopes that weve got close to achieving what you wanted
computer run holodeck programme krios one
enter when ready


astonishing it is the ancient temple of akadar it is this temple that bonds krios and valt gentlemen two brothers ruled a vast empire from this site until they were torn apart by their love for an extraordinary woman this is where the wars began and this is where they shall end



there are some details to be added of course
commander la forge will be entirely at your disposal ambassador

just let me know what you need
yes of course i must consult several of the historical volumes i brought with me so perhaps we can reconvene later
excuse me excuse me is it true is a kriosian ambassador aboard this vessel
yes can i help you
the ambassadors very busy
ah do you schedule his appointments
im the captain of the ship what is it you want
allow me to present myself par lenor of the ferengi trade mission we are pleased to hear ambassador that you have at last negotiated peace with the valtese ambassador peace is good for trade unless you happen to be an arms merchant
excuse us
arms merchant



in return for the exclusive rights to transport all kriosian products to the valt system
may i suggest that you arrange to meet at another time after the ceremony
perhaps that would be best
but but

listen have you had a chance to see the dolphins yet

deck seven picard to worf
worf here captain
lieutenant one of the ferengi just waylaid ambassador briam i need you to keep them on a tight leash

i dont want them disrupting this conference
aye sir security to cargo bay one
lieutenant
one of the ferengi
riker to captain picard


what are you doing

this is a misunderstanding i was looking for a barbershop apparently i made an incorrect turn and

mister worf
get him out of here confine them both to their quarters put a guard on their door

what is happening
emergence

i am for you alrik of valt
no kamala this is not alrik this is captain jeanluc picard of the federation starship enterprise
that explains why you dont look at all like your holographs i apologise captain as an empath i could sense your authority i assumed you were chancellor alrik
im afraid i require an explanation ambassador
as do i ambassador why have i been brought out of stasis prematurely
it was an accident this is quite complicated perhaps you and i
it is not complicated at all briam and the captain has no tolerance for prevarication im a gift to alrik of valt
you mean youre using this ship to transport a sentient being as property
not as property as a gift and i was concerned that you might not entirely understand
your concern was justified ambassador
youre angry why
there is a provision in the federation constitution that protects an individuals fundamental rights now once you were brought aboard this ship
youre coming to my rescue what a kind and generous purpose but captain i do not need to be rescued
kamala is the key to peace between our two worlds
why
in our history theres a woman known as garuth who was loved by the brothers krios and valt with such passion that an empire fell
and the wars began when krios kidnapped garuth and took her to our planet
like her im an empathic metamorph the first female metamorph born in my world for over a hundred years
a metamorph
a mutant a biological curiosity if you will with the ability to sense what a potential mate wants what he needs what gives him the greatest pleasure and then to become that for him
you mean you change according to whatever man youre with
until i reach the stage of bonding when i must imprint upon myself the requirements of one man to serve as his perfect partner in life
you see male metamorphs are somewhat common but females are born only once in seven generations so obviously they are greatly sought after as mates
which explains the ferengis interest
this mating to alrik was arranged sine her birth by the leaders of both worlds in the hopes of restoring peace
you do this of your own accord
it is my sole purpose in life
commander riker escort her to quarters theres no need for you to travel in the cargo bay
kamala remain in your room i will speak to you shortly

why were you in stasis
metamorphs have a long and complex sexual maturing process i am in the finiisral the third and final stage it can be an uncomfortable transition not only for me but for the men around me
in what way
my body is producing an unusually elevated level of what you would call pheromones the effect can be quite provocative perhaps you sense it
ah unfortunately im not an empath
oh i think you are more empathic than you admit at least when it comes to women
i think you have me at a disadvantage

this is the comm panel the replicator you can lower the lights on a verbal command if you have any questions you can just ask the computer

im beginning to sense the elevated pheromones you were referring to
you were curious werent you
curious isnt exactly how id describe it
do you know whats remarkable about empathic metamorphs
you mean theres something even more remarkable about you
we learn so quickly what stimulates a man that the second times even better than the first

listen this has been educational but i make it a policy never to open another mans gift
i know my role in history commander but its going to be a long voyage
it certainly is well try to make you as comfortable as possible

riker to bridge if you need me ill be in holodeck four


how can you simply deliver her like a courier into a life of virtual prostitution
beverly arranged marriages have been the basis of political alliances in many cultures including our own
im surprised at you
she knows exactly what shes doing
she has been conditioned since the day she was born to believe its perfectly acceptable to exist only to please men
she was born to do this
and bred by those people to seal a treaty with a seductive coup de grace
all right fine good lets throw the prime directive to the winds lets detain her against her will lets destroy any chance of peace between these worlds lets interfere in their society their customs
that slave trader who calls himself an ambassador he has confined her to her quarters she is a virtual prisoner in there
i didnt know that
well it is your ship maybe there are a few things you should find out about
ill talk to her about it
good lovely breakfast
indeed

come in

captain picard what a delightful surprise come in
thank you are you comfortable
reasonably under the circumstances
it has been brought to my attention that you have been told to remain in here
thats true im afraid
against your wishes
at the request of the ambassador who believes i might be disruptive to your crew
the performance of my crew is none of the ambassadors business
you care about my well being thank you captain
i care about i care about what happens on board my ship
yes i know this ships very important to you isnt it
oh yes oh yes it is
are all captains lives so solitary or just yours
dont
what
dont do this this this you do with men
im afraid my premature emergence from stasis has left me a little vulnerable to the desires i sense from men nevertheless this is who i am captain you might as well ask a vulcan to forgo logic or a klingon to be nonviolent i cannot change and i dont want to until the time has come for me to bond with my permanent mate why does it bother you
frankly its difficult for me for many of us to easily accept that a sentient being can live only to be what someone else wants them to be
but thats what gives a metamorph pleasure
but what about your wishes your needs
they are fulfilled by what i give to others
and what about when there are no others when you are alone
im incomplete what curious questions captain
under the circumstances i thought that it would help if i learned more about you
but you know me better than you realise i am independent forceful brilliant and adventurous exactly as you would have me be captain
i will speak to the ambassador about easing your restrictions
thank you captain
captains log stardate  we have reached the designated coordinates for the conference and await the arrival of chancellor alrik


i forbid it
forbid it
its too dangerous captain she must remain in her quarters
you cannot confine her against her will not on board this ship ambassador she is requesting some freedom of movement and i intend to give it to her
she is still in the finiisral the height of her sexual allure captain every man on the ship will be fighting over her
not every man

a chaperone
i would be pleased to escort you around the ship
but i was hoping we might spend more time together captain
i shall busy making arrangements for the conference
im very knowledgeable about valt i could be helpful
i think that you should enjoy the hospitality of the ship mister data here will see to your every comfort if you will excuse me

your empathic powers do not perceive anything because as an android i have no emotions
i can understand why captain picard chose you to be my chaperone


 ill check in with you later

excuse me but im absolutely certain that we met once at paloris colony
ive never been to paloris colony
neither have i why dont we find out what else we have in common
extremely rude behaviour
hes just being playful
perhaps you would care for something to drink
what are you all having boys
aldorian ales our drink
then its mine too
bartender
there do not seem to be enough waiters on duty
i believe theyre having a minor problem with the replicator
they could use a hand commander
excuse me i believe i will stay
mister datas protecting me tonight
protecting you from what
from you i guess i told the captain not to worry i just want to have a good time like anybody else
come on down to deck seven well show you a good time
get rid of the android well have some fun
is there a problem here
no sir
no problem
tell him lady
thank you lieutenant the crowd seemed a bit too ebullient for comfort perhaps you would enjoy a quiet visit to the arboretum


perhaps the ambassador is right perhaps i should remain in my quarters
i have confidence in the selfcontrol of my crew kamala but there are guests and civilians on board
i understand i will volunteer to stay in my quarters under one condition that you will visit me there it is again
what
the wall you put between us
kamala you are one day away from an arranged mating why would you want me to visit you in your quarters
i said a visit i didnt ask you to make love to me

ventanan thimble early lapeongical period isnt it
yes it is
have you seen the ventanan woven art recovered from the fourth colony dig
woven art recovered intact
they say the colours are remarkably vibrant for their age
ive read about them for years but they were so delicate no one expected to find any preserved how do you know about them
i stay informed on a wide variety of subjects after all one never knows when the conversation might turn to ventanan archeology or to the dark woman of raven brows and mournful eyes in shakespeares sonnets or to the gardens of les eyries near the village where you grew up
your empathic powers told you all this about me
not quite that much mister data helped a little
i see
my empathic powers can only sense a man of deep passion and conviction so controlled so disciplined i am simply curious to know what lies beneath
nothing nothing lies beneath im really quite dull i fall asleep each night with an old book in my hands
when a metamorph finds you interesting do not take it lightly
oh im not taking it lightly im just trying to be as dull as possible
will you visit me
it would be inappropriate
is that a yes or a no
im sorry
even the walls of jericho fell captain
why are you doing this kamala
there can be only one reason because some part of you wants me to


ambassador
what is the meaning of this
ah i see you got our message
is this some sort of bribe i am not amused
no ambassador your attitude is quite understandable
this is just a sample
the bribe is ten thousand more
ludugial gold the purest in the galaxy
we know the lifestyle of a kriosian ambassador is far from comfortable
you deserve to live a life of luxury
how dare you suggest

our money what you drive a hard bargain
twenty thousand but not an ingot more
we must have the metamorph
she is the answer to a ferengi prayer
we have a ship waiting to rendezvous with us in three hours we can all transport off together
thank you for sharing that information i shall pass on along to captain picard
you cant do that
let go of me

captains log supplemental the ferengi have been dispatched via shuttle to starbase one one seven what charges will be brought against them depends on whether or not ambassador briam recovers

weve been able to stabilise his condition if were lucky hell regain consciousness in a few days set up level one craniosacral display
yes doctor
ill advise the valtese delegation that the conference will have to be postponed
that wont be possible my ability to imprint on a mate will only last a matter of hours after the completion of the finiisral if i hadnt been removed from stasis prematurely a delay might have been possible but now i will have to bond with alrik within two days
but there are points in the negotiations that briam still has to address
you are familiar with the issues
familiar yes but i cant represent your peoples interests
you can represent the interests of peace my people will agree im certain of it
but there are customs and rituals of which i have no experience at all
i told you im extremely knowledgeable about valt i will help you prepare


torze qua

thats right
im reminded of piano lessons when i was a child preparing for some dreaded recital
you still play
no i regret that i gave it up it used to please my mother but i didnt like performing in front of an audience
shy
no just not very good
thank you for letting down your guard if only for a moment
you will have to help me in the pronunciation of this scroll
what is it about me you fear
kamala
do you find me unattractive
i find you unavailable
im being terribly selfish i apologise we have something in common captain when i was a child i took music lessons too
really what instrument
all of them
the entire orchestra
plus a few valtese horns that sound like braying targhee moonbeasts they are said to soothe the nerves of valtese men my mother never even heard me play i was taken from her when i was four and sequestered in a royal village where i was prepared to fulfill my destiny
it sounds as if it were a very lonely time for you
on the contrary i had servants and tutors at my side constantly you once asked me what im like when im alone ive never been there was always somebody there to educate me in literature history art sex but i have been alone on this journey and ive found myself thinking about all the curious questions you asked you wanted to know who i am and as i continue to ask myself the only answer that comes to me is i am for you alrik of valt because thats the truth in a day i will bond with a man ive never met and i will turn myself into what he wants me to be for the rest of my life
i also once asked you if you were doing this of your own accord
im honoured to be chosen to serve my people as an emissary of peace but i find it ironic on the eve of this ceremony which i have spent my entire life preparing for that i should meet a man like you
riker to picard
go ahead number one
the valtese ship has arrived chancellor alrik is ready to beam aboard


captain picard
chancellor alrik welcome aboard the enterprise
your first officer has described the details of the incident with the ferengis how is the ambassador
he has not regained consciousness
a tragedy your willingness to assist is appreciated by both our peoples
i doing my best although im finding some of the rituals quite demanding
rituals i am more concerned about the remaining provisions of the treaty the proposed trade agreements are not acceptable we still must review the uncommitted territories as well as discuss the schedule for exchange of technology
the kriosians have authorised me to make several compromises favourable to your position
good tomorrow then
briam has supervised a reproduction of the ancient temple of akadar on our holodeck
such a sentimental people these kriosians its hard to believe we have a common ancestry
please
i suppose theyve sent the metamorph
kamala yes shes looking forward to meeting you
im sure shell be satisfactory between you and me captain i am far more interested in the trade agreements

so tell me quickly what is he like
first impressions hes a thoughtful man informed
did he ask about me
yes
what did you tell him
that you were looking forward to meeting him
when am i to be presented
itll be the first order of business tomorrow at ten
would you like some tea
thank you but i should prepare for the ceremony
let me help you with pronunciations
i think i can muddle my way through
please dont leave talk to me i love the sound of your voice ill turn out the lights and just listen i dont want to be alone
the lights stay on
earl grey tea hot
did you learn that from commander data as well i shall have to have a talk with him

now that i know that youre listening to my voice i find that i cant think of anything to say
a starship captain must encounter all sorts of lifeforms am i one of the most unique youve ever met please say yes
yes
what a nice thing to say

kamala have i not done everything possible to discourage this
maybe thats the perfect way to attract a metamorph
i dont want to use you as other men do
but youre not other men you could never use me thats the very reason why im with you tonight
i should go and you have an appointment tomorrow morning early
light years away


quiet this morning
im sorry
penny
what
for your thoughts penny for your thoughts
do you have one
im sure the replicator will have one on file
beverly may i take off the uniform for a moment
captain
i need to talk to a friend
of course
actually its all your fault
mine
you insisted i look into her situation
the metamorph
the metamorph kamala ive spent quite a lot of time with her the past few days and youre right about several things but beverly her entire existence has been orchestrated for this moment and she intends to go through with it to help her people end the war
and youre saying theres nothing you can do about it
it isnt that simple i barely know who she is and who she is changes the moment the next man comes into the room and i find myself hoping that the next man wont come in but of course he does and in a few hours the ceremony will begin and she will mate with a man who cares more about trade agreements than he cares about her and i cant help thinking how she will be with him how she will change to accommodate him
i wish i knew how i could help
perhaps i just needed a shoulder
oh its there for you jeanluc it always has been

come in

is it time
soon
do you have any questions about the ceremony
many
i will never truly love him
youve not even met him
it no longer matters i wish i could convey to you what its like to be a metamorph to feel the inner strength of someone to realise that being with him is opening your mind and heart to endless new possibilities to hear yourself say i like myself when im with him
kamala
for a metamorph theres no greater pleasure and no greater wish than to bond with that kind of mate at the end of the finiisral as ive bonded with you
with me
who i am today i will be forever
data to captain picard
not now data
but sir chancellor alrik is waiting to receive you in holodeck seven
acknowledged you cant go through with the ceremony
would you ask me to stay and ask two armies to keep fighting having bonded with you ive learned the meaning of duty hell never know im still empathic i will be able to please him i only hope he likes shakespeare


i am for you alrik of valt


your service to both our peoples is greatly appreciated captain
your preparations made the negotiations simple ambassador and kamala was able to guide me through the rituals
i have to admit im curious
curious
i was chosen for this mission for a very simple reason im two hundred years old the temptations of a beautiful metamorph do not easily reach me and yet i would be lying if i were to claim that even at my age they do not reach me at all but you you worked with her side by side for days how could you resist her
ambassador have a safe trip home
energise
imaginary friend



i like to cook all kinds of stuff like yogurt and raisin salad chocolate chip pancakes and purple omelettes
purple omelettes
you put grape juice in the eggs isabella doesnt like it very much she says it tastes funny
i can see her point sugar with your tea
yes please
isabella would you like some too
yes but she takes two cubes
ill bet isabella is very pretty
shes very very pretty she has blonde hair and a blue dress with white buttons her ears are pierced and shes tall
maybe you could draw me a picture id love to see what she looks like
you dont think shes real
i think shes real for you and that is real enough for me
honey i think its time for you to go you dont want to keep keiko waiting
i have to go plant the nasturtiums now im keikos helper in the arboretum today
is that so
you go ahead sweetie and be home for dinner
i hope i see you soon maybe we can be friends
okay counsellor troi
yes
isabella says she likes you
why thank you isabella

i can understand your concern ensign sutter but really you have nothing to worry about its a normal healthy activity for children to engage in imaginary play
im just afraid shes not making any real friends she spends all of her time with isabella
youve been moving from starship to starship since clara was two years old maybe isabella provides a constant companion she knows this is one friend she wont have to leave behind
youre probably right
give clara a chance as she learns to make friends on the enterprise youll probably find that shell leave her imaginary world behind
captains log stardate  the enterprise has arrived at fgc four seven a nebula which has formed around a neutron star we are eager to investigate this unique formation

weve got elevated quantities of hydrogen helium and trionium but nothing the shields cant handle
shields up
take us in ensign one quarter impulse
aye sir


in order for the lateral sensors to complete their scheduled observations additional processing time will be required
we could steal a couple of hours from the engineering team while theyre recalibrating the thermal interferometery scanner
will two hours be enough time to complete the highresolution series on the neutron star
no problem well just double up the main sensor bandwidth while theyre freeing up the lateral unit


and then after dinner then what
we went to the holodeck and took a walk on the champs elysees
the neural scanner still seems to be a bit off lets check the sensor calibrations
ill run a diagnostic

and
and
after paris
he has shore leave next month he asked me to go to risa with him
no problem nurse mcclukidge can cover for you
i dont think im going doctor i hear its a very uninhibited atmosphere personally i dont think im ready for that kind of fun
try to talk him into tavena minor they have a cruise down the jokri river the iridescent currents are beautiful


see isabella you have to push your finger into the soil as far as it can go im making a hole for the seeds now they need to be watered but the baby seeds are very small so we mustnt give them too much to drink

hello is anybody there
hello
isabella
hello clara

isabella how come i can see you
is something wrong with the way i look
no ive just never seen you before not for real
well now you can see me for real doesnt that make you happy
yes its wonderful
can we go now
wed better finish planting the seeds first
im tired of planting lets do something else
like what
like i would really like to explore the ship
wed better finish planting first i promised keiko
we can finish later lets go look around
id better ask my daddy
your daddy wont mind we can tell him later come on

so what are we going to name this nebula fgc forty seven just doesnt have the proper ring to it
why dont we call it sutters cloud
the rotational period of the neutron star is one point three five seconds
thats a bit on the long side sutter lets see if you can get a reading on the particle flux
aye sir
i was thinking about something more along the lines of the la forge nebula its got sort of a majestic sound dont you think
given the selections i prefer fgc four seven

what was that
it felt like we hit something
shields have registered an impact however sensors show nothing in the vicinity

forward velocity is down by point two percent and dropping
engineering

report
could be something wrong with the shields captain were checking it out now
systems are normal sir
so did we hit something or not shields say yes sensors say no this is very strange ensign give me a breakdown on shield energy conversion and then run a spectral  whoa where did you come from
im clara sutter thats my daddy
clara you cant be here right now
but isabella wanted to see engineering
i dont care what isabella wanted to see you go back to our quarters right now
but daddy
bridge to la forge our speed is still dropping
i hear you captain im increasing the power to the impulse engines but forward velocity just isnt consistent with engine output
explanation
it seems like theres something increasing the drag coefficient on the ship

but we cant find the source
if we cant correct it we may have to reverse course and leave the nebula

give me a couple of minutes here captain
clara now

im sorry commander


why do you keep disappearing like that
the grownups dont believe im real when theyre around i have to be invisible wait here


the drag coefficient continues to increase our velocity has fallen by twelve percent velocity is increasing ships speed has stabilised at one quarter impulse
thats great data whatd you do
i did nothing the problem seems to have corrected itself


where did you go
there was something i had to do

i dont have an explanation captain we seemed to hit something then we started losing speed so far as we can tell theres nothing out there to hit
could some kind of damping field have caused us to lose velocity
we have simulated several such fields but were unable to reproduce the same drag coefficient
and we still dont know why the problem suddenly corrected itself
it seems were looking a unique phenomenon one that hasnt been recorded before
the question is do we stay here and check it out
might be dangerous
since we have only experienced the phenomenon once it is impossible to estimate the risks
captain id like to stay here for a little bit collect some samples of the gaseous matter see what it tells us
agreed collect your samples mister la forge well proceed with caution dismissed

whats in here
thats the door to the cargo bay we cant go in there
lets go someplace with a lot of people
okay isabella why are you so serious lately
what do you mean
you havent even smiled once today

youre my best friend isabella
why
i dont know because we do things together and we trade secrets
does everybody have a best friend
if theyre lucky before i had you i didnt have one
why not
every time i made friends with someone my daddys job would change and wed move to a new ship it takes time to make a best friend
how long
it depends with you not very long you always listened to me even when i was sad
clara im glad were best friends
race you
okay
ready set go

this area is not designated for children are you lost where are you supposed to be
we were only playing were sorry
return to your quarters and we will forget this incident
thank you come on


okay ive configured the magnetic coil to collect samples of gaseous matter from the nebula go ahead and activate the beam emitter
im setting the fractionater to a continuous cycle
well take samples from eight random sections that ought to give us a reliable measure
commander i understand that you had a parent who was in starfleet
two of them as a matter of fact my father was an exozoologist my mother a command officer
they must have been posted to a lot of different assignments
thats putting it mildly they were always on the move some of the time together sometimes separately i never knew whether or not i was going to be stationed with my father while he studied invertebrates in the modean system or on some outpost near the neutral zone with my mom
was that hard on you
i dont remember it that way
it must have been disruptive if you didnt stay in one place long enough to make friends
well i suppose there were aspects of my childhood that were less than ideal but to me it was just one long adventure children are a lot stronger than you think as long as they know you love them they can handle just about anything life throws at them you know
thanks commander


its a samarian coral fish with its fin unfolded
i believe what you are seeing is the effect of the fluid dynamic processes inherent in the large scale motion of highly rarified gas
no no first it was a fish and now its a mintonian sailing ship
where
right there dont you see the two swirls coming together to form the mast
i do not see it it is interesting that people try to find meaningful patterns in things that are essentially random i have noticed that the images they perceive sometimes suggest what they are thinking about at that particular moment besides it is clearly a bunny rabbit

looks as though someones lost their way excuse me hello are you looking for someone
no i brought isabella to see ten forward
oh i see well ordinarily we would only let you in with a grownup but since youve brought isabella you can be my guest wont you join me
thank you
now how about two papalla juices with extra bubbles
just one please isabella isnt thirsty
one juice
youre not like the other grownups
oh no
they dont think isabellas real
well most grownups have a hard time with things they cant see
why
well because they get preoccupied by other things
like what
like how much fuel it takes to power a ship or whether we should go to one star system or another or whether little girls should go to bed at seven or be allowed to stay up till eight so their heads can get so full that they forget about the things that are important to you and me like imaginary friends
if the other grownups dont understand how come you do
maybe because when i was your age i had one
you did what was she like
it wasnt a she
what was he like
it wasnt a he
it
it was a tarkassian razor beast it had dark brown fur and gold eyes and huge spiny wings and it would fly so fast nobody could see it except me
sounds scary
oh it was especially when he smiled but the best thing about him was i could curl up on his furry belly and he had the softest purr you ever heard it put me right to sleep every night i tell you that razorbeast was a good friend
so is isabella

hello clara
hello
clara and isabella and i were just having a conversation
would you and isabella like to come for a walk with me
i guess so bye
bye clara bye isabella

clara you havent been on this she very long so maybe you dont know but ten forward is usually for grownups
i know that i didnt want to go but isabella wanted to see it
if isabella is making you do things you know are wrong then you must tell her its not acceptable
i try to but she doesnt listen

deck thirty two clara do you want me to talk to isabella

isabella its not very nice to get clara to do things that she isnt supposed to
shes over there
from now on i want you to ask a grownup before you go to any place that is offlimits
what does she say
she said
clara please tell me what isabella said
she said youd better leave us alone

im a little concerned at the turn this is taking it seems clara is beginning to do inappropriate things and blaming them on isabella
she came into engineering today she said it was isabellas idea
i dont think its too serious yet but we should make more of an effort to get her involved with real friends her own age the childrens centres having a ceramics class this afternoon why dont i take clara
i think shed like that
ill see if theres any room left in the class in the meantime i think you should make yourself more available to clara let her know she doesnt have to rely on isabella when she needs someone to talk to
counsellor thank you


are you mad at me im sorry i got you in trouble
thats okay
are we still best friends
here you can help me put this together if you want
clara why are grownups so mean
theyre not mean theyre just more serious than we are
sometimes i wish they would just go away
you do
yes i dont like them im bored lets go back to engineering
were not allowed to go there
i thought we were best friends
we are
then why wont you play with me
i told you
you always listen to the grownups you dont care about me
thats not true
i thought wed have fun together once you could really see me i thought youd like me lets go to engineering clara just for a little while no one will know itll be our secret and if they find us well tell them we got lost

who is it
counsellor troi

hello clara
hi
i came to ask if youd like to go to a ceramics class
can isabella come too
no lets do something with isabella another day
well okay


sir as we move deeper into the nebula sensors indicate that the levels of helium and trionium are continuing to rise
is it something that the shields cant handle
no sir we are well within tolerance levels

mister data
shields have registered an impact
but the sensors show nothing out there right
there is no indication of anything near the ship
forward velocity is dropping captain down by point four percent
can we go to warp speed
until we determine the cause of the drag coefficient i would not recommend it sir
forward velocity down by one point one percent
ensign increase power to the impulse engines
aye sir impulse engines now at full power
we are no longer losing speed forward velocity is holding steady
the drag coefficient is still present but it has stabilised
bridge to commander riker check with mister la forge see if he found anything in the matter sample from the nebula
on my way sir

any luck
yeah take a look at this we tried radiating the subject matter with just about everything we could think of we didnt find anything until we subjected it to a high frequency warp field we think this is what weve been running into
do you know what it is
we think so now that the sensors can read it it seems to be a highly cohesive form of plasma like a strand of energy
we figure its a segment of just part of a network of much larger strands
when these things come in contact with our shields it produces a resonant effect and that creates the drag coefficient weve been experiencing
is there anything like this on record
no sir
do you know how many of them there might be
no but if we run the warp field generators through the deflector grid we could radiate a field outside the ship
and wed be able to see for ourselves lets do it

alexander i thought you might like a partner this is clara sutter shes new on the enterprise clara meet alexander rozhenko
im making a cup for my father want to help
go ahead

well youre supposed to put them in a row like this
clara would you like some clay of your own
here honey

ive never made a cup before how do you make the round part
well its easy you take a big piece of clay like this and push your hand into it

warp field generators are standing by
captain we should be able to illuminate any strands within two thousand kilometres of the ship
proceed
initiating field generation
remarkable

it is an irregular lattice composed of approximately forty seven million strands of energy
captain with this many of them the resonant effect on our shields could cause a problem
agreed ensign bring us about take us out of the nebula
it may be difficult sir i am detecting a significant number of strands behind us
do your best ensign
aye sir

hot chocolate computer i need my appointment schedule for next week


kryonian tigers arent so scary i saw one once
you did
my father took me to the zoo on brentalia all the tiger did was lick my hand and he smelled funny
i think we need more water
ill get some

isabella
clara
i didnt do it
who did
it was isabella
i dont see anybody
shes invisible
i spent two weeks on that that was really mean
i didnt do it i didnt
clara theres no such thing as invisible people youre lying

hey
isabella stop



clara
why were you being so mean to me whyd you do that to my friend
because you ran away from me you left me alone i had to do everything by myself
youre scaring me
i was going to protect you clara i liked you but now i dont care now when the others come you can die along with everyone else

status mister data
at our current speed we will clear the nebula in twelve minutes four seconds
continue a full sensor sweep i want all the information we can gather

captain forward velocity is down by point six percent  velocity down by two point four percent
mister data
we are moving through a dense concentration of energy strands
can we go to warp
the stress on the hull would be too great
captain density appears to be lower off the starboard bow
ensign bring us to bearing oh three oh mark five
aye sir
forward velocity holding
steady as she goes

is something wrong with the cake
excuse me
well i see you sitting here with a piece of untouched chocolate cake in front of you i assume somethings wrong with the cake or somethings bothering you
im sure the cake is fine ive just been thinking
let me guess about the little girl with the imaginary friend
im wondering if im doing the right thing
how so
well i know the best thing to do is to gradually wean her away from her fantasy and she did make some new friends today and had a good time
but
but i cant help feeling that im taking something from her something precious a part of her childhood shell never have again
well im not sure about that i was just telling clara about my imaginary friend
you have an imaginary friend
a tarkassian razor beast it protected me i knew as long as that razorbeast was around nothing could hurt me you know over the years his body kind of faded away but the idea stayed and i just dont seem to talk to him as often as i used to
you still talk to it
oh yeah when im afraid or i get confused or a little scared i just dont think you should have to give up an imaginary friend
ensign sutter to counsellor troi
go ahead ensign

would you come to my quarters im having a problem with clara

im on my way

she wont even go into her room shes terrified that isabellas going to hurt her
clara your father tells me isabella has been saying some very bad things to you what did she say
she said they were going to come and kill everyone
whos going to come and kill everyone
the others like her
did she say why i know youre very frightened sometimes what we imagine can be just as scary as something real but i promise you there is no way isabella can harm you or anyone on this ship
but shes not imaginary anymore shes real now i can see her
you can see her
yes
if i go with you and hold your hand will you go into your room
i think so
well make sure isabella isnt anywhere around okay come on

do you see anybody

lets look under the bed is she there okay where else
is she behind here

maybe isabellas gone home

lets see anything here maybe isabella knows that youve got new friends now in fact ill bet she wont be coming around as much anymore
maybe what about in the closet
okay anybody in here looks pretty empty to me


she was eleven maybe twelve with blonde hair clara
claras sleeping shes going to be fine her bioelectrical processes were severely disrupted its as if the energy were pulled right out of her body
captain clara has told me that her imaginary friend has been making threats she claimed that others were on the way and that they had plans to kill everyone on the ship
picard to lieutenant worf

worf here sir
lieutenant

weve established the presence of what appears to be an alien entity on board it seems the entity has manifested itself in the form of a twelve year old human girl who has been seen with clara sutter she has blonde hair blue eyes
and a blue dress

yes sir i have seen her
when
two days ago near engineering she was with miss sutter
security alert

mister worf keep a good lookout
aye sir

she insisted on talking to you
its about isabella
what about her clara
i think her feelings were hurt she said she liked me she liked being with me she was my friend she only got mean when i stopped paying attention to her
did she say when the others were coming  all right thanks sweetie you go back to bed now well handle this
but daddy
clara if we need your help again i hope we can count on you
yes captain
captain picard report to the bridge
on my way

report
our speed is down by twenty two percent
strand density is ten times what it was captain we cant take many more of these hits
all stop
sir something is heading toward us bearing one oh three mark oh two four
on screen

it appears to be an energy vortex of highly complex patterns possibly a life form
red alert
it is in direct physical contact with our shields
shield strength dropping to seventy five percent seventy two percent
the damn things feeding off our shields mister data remodulate our shield frequencies
aye sir no effect

shield strength has dropped to sixty four percent
weve got about eight minutes before this thing drains our shields
any ideas


isabella isabella dont you want to talk to me im not mad at you isabella
we know youve been on this ship for some time now and that youre posing as claras friend and that youve been threatening her we can only assume that there is some connection between yourself and the life forms attacking this ship youre obviously an intelligent being theres no reason to hide from us talk to us or can you only communicate by threatening a small child
im scared isabella

who are you
i came here to determine whether you were a threat to us and to examine the purity of your energy sources
energy is that why youre draining our shields
yes the emissions from your graviton field generators are far richer than our normal sources of energy

picard to bridge report
shields are down to three percent were diverting all available power
acknowledged if its energy that you want we have other ways of providing it you neednt destroy us
you should be destroyed you are cruel uncaring creatures
what makes you say that
the way you treat clara
in what way have we mistreated her
you wouldnt let her do what she wanted to or go where she wanted to
you mean where you wanted her to
what difference does it make
you were taking her to places that were inappropriate even dangerous
i wouldnt have let anything happen to her
we didnt know that we didnt even know if you were real all we knew was that a little girls imaginary friend was frightening her threatening her
that was only after you told clara not to be my friend
i understand you are seeing this ship all of us from a unique perspective from a childs point of view it must seem terribly unfair and restrictive to you as adults we dont always stop to consider how everything we say and do shapes the impressions of young people but if youre judging us as a people by the way we treat our children and i think there can be better criterion then you must understand how deeply we care for them when our children are young they dont understand what might be dangerous our rules are to keep them from harm real or imagined and thats part of the continuity of our human species when clara grows up she will make rules for her children to protect them as we protect her
please dont hurt us if you still want to be my best friend id like that very much


status number one
were clear of the strands well have full warp capability in twenty minutes
notify all sections well be leaving this area in one hour
sir
mister la forge i want you to drive the warp engines to full power and direct a flow of energy out into the nebula
aye sir

i came to say im sorry i frightened you
thats okay
and i misled you i wasnt really your isabella
for a while you were
i never had a friend before
im sorry i have to go away
do you think youll ever come back
i hope so
so do i
i borg

captains log stardate  the enterprise is charting six star systems that make up the argolis cluster an area being considered for colonisation


very impressive
its beautiful but frightening at the same time
captain i am detecting a transmission emanating from within the system
what sort of signal
it is selfrepeating of unknown pattern
where is it coming from
a small moon orbiting the fourth planet
life signs
indeterminate i am attempting to screen out sensor interference readings are still inconclusive however the moons atmosphere is capable of supporting life
it could be a distress call helm take us into transport range doctor crusher meet me in transporter room two with a medical away team
acknowledged

im reading one life form very weak signs

riker to enterprise
go ahead number one
weve found the wreckage of a small craft

one survivor its a borg male adolescent hes badly hurt
sir there is no indication of other borg activity within sensor range
away team prepare to return to the ship
captain we cant

leave him here he wont survive
i think the captain understands that
i dont
the borg usually collect their dead
hes not dead
the transmission
at least not yet
the transmission that we intercepted was probably a homing signal we have to assume theyre on their way
let me at least stabilise his condition give him a chance of surviving until they get here

your concern is noted doctor but any intervention on our part would alert the borg to our having been here

im afraid weve turned that corner already
kill it now make it appear that it died in the crash

leave no evidence that we were ever here
security measures must be taken before we beam it on board
thank you captain standing by
mister data notify security to prepare a detention cell bridge to engineering
la forge here
were bringing a borg survivor on board well need to neutralise the homing signal

prevent it from sending or receiving transmissions of any kind
ill set up a subspace damping field around the detention cell
very well

four more none survived
picard to riker
go ahead enterprise

we are transporting you directly to the detention cell
i need him in sickbay captain
the cell doctor whatever equipment you need will be brought to you there
very well


come
captain i just wondered if theres anything you wanted to talk about
i dont think so counsellor
i would have thought having a borg on the ship would stir some feelings
im quite recovered from my experience thank you
sometimes even when a victim has dealt with his assault there are residual effects of the event that linger you were treated violently by the borg
kidnapped assaulted mutilated
counsellor counsellor i very much appreciate your concern for me but i can assure you it is quite misplaced i have carefully considered the implications of having a borg on this ship i have weighed the possible risks and i am convinced that we are doing the right thing now i am quite comfortable with my decision
i see well if at any point you want to talk more
i shall certainly avail myself of your help


lower the forcefield

captain the borg is still unconscious
he suffered massive internal injuries weve been able to control the haemorrhaging but some of the implants in his brain were damaged i may have to remove them
the borg will die if theyre removed permanently their brains grow dependent on the biochips
perhaps geordi can construct some new implants
they contain relatively straightforward programming interface protocols we have the files we downloaded after your experience captain i think i can manage it
mister la forge do you know enough about borg programming to alter the pathways to their root command structure
im not sure sir the subroutines are pretty complicated id probably have to study the data processing algorithms its the only way i could trace the access codes
if we could get to the root command we could introduce an invasive programming sequence through its biochip system and then return it to the hive
the borg are so interconnected it would act like a virus
which would infect the entire collective we could disable their neural network at a stroke
infect it you make it sound like a disease
quite right doctor if all goes well a terminal one

if this works the way i think it will once the invasive programme starts spreading itll only be a matter of months before the borg suffer total systems failure
comments
a question what exactly is total systems failure
the borg are extremely computer dependent a systems failure will destroy them
i just think we should be plain about that were talking about annihilating an entire race
which under most circumstances would be unconscionable but as i see it the borg leave us with little choice
i agree were at war
theres been no formal declaration of war
not from us but certainly from them theyve attacked us in every encounter
theyve declared war on our way of life we are to be assimilated
but even in war there are rules you dont kill civilians indiscriminately
there are no civilians among the borg
think of them as a single collective being theres no one borg who is more an individual than your arm or your leg
how convenient
your point doctor
when i look at my patient i dont see a collective consciousness i dont see a hive i see a living breathing boy whos been hurt and who needs our help and were talking about sending him back to his people as an instrument of destruction
it comes down to this were faced with an enemy who are determined to destroy us and we have no hope of negotiating a peace unless that changes we are justified in doing anything we can to survive
security to captain
picard here
the borg has regained consciousness sir
acknowledged we proceed with the plan


whats he doing
hes trying to find an access terminal so he can interface with the collective he doesnt understand that the signal has been cut off
hes emitting a homing signal and a second subspace beacon but our damping field is blocking both signals
hes alone for the first time hes being forced to cope with his environment without the resources of the collective
he must be hungry the borg dont ingest food their implants can synthesise any organic molecules the biological tissues require what they need is energy
arrange to feed it
aye sir

ill have to adapt a power conduit and install it in there
if i didnt know better id think he was scared


i dont think i like this sport
last week when you scored two touches you liked it well enough today you were dropping your foil you kept letting me inside
ah but if i lift up you lunge right underneath lets face it youre just better at this than i am i understand we have a guest on board
yes
is that wise
im not sure i hope so
i thought i understood you picard but i dont understand this
it was an errand of mercy he was injured doctor crusher decided for humanitarian reasons to care for him
theyre going to come after us you know that you of all people know that
shall we go again

are you all right

you felt sorry for me look what it got you

ill have to go in to connect the power conduit
i will follow the commander reactivate the field once were through

good now stay that way

commander

we are borg you will be assimilated resistance is futile
just look around pal youre hardly in a position to make any demands
we must return to the collective
whos we
we are borg
yeah but theres only one of you do you have a name a means of identification
third of five
there were five on your ship is that it just a number
third of five
it does kind of suit you okay this is for you it regulates the power flow to the frequency that youre used to this connection should fit the coupling on your arm youre welcome lets get out of here
lower the forcefield

hes hungry all right
why do you do this
im just a nice guy at heart you feeling better
you are not borg
thats right and i hope to stay that way
you will be assimilated resistance is futile
thats gratitude for you


ive been rationing his portions of energy i think he understands when he cooperates he gets fed if not
like a rat in a cage
look if im going to figure out his command pathways i need to learn how he processes information and the only way i know to do that is by giving him perceptual tests and for that i need his cooperation
so he can participate in the destruction of his entire species
doctor
i know i know were at war im here to help but i dont have to like it
okay i think were ready to transport him if he gives us any trouble we can access the force field through that console are you ready
la forge to transporter room three were ready here
were standing by commander
energise

third of five this is doctor crusher doctor crusher this is third of five
hello
what is a doctor
a doctor heals the sick and repairs the injured
the sick and injured are reabsorbed others take their place
that isnt what happen to you when we found you you were dying i saved your life
why
its my duty to help those who are hurt
you give us food
yeah
is that your duty
yeah thats right listen third of five doctor crusher here has repaired a lot of the damage to your biochip implants we want to run a few tests make sure everythings working okay
tests
id like to show you a few diagrams and ask you some questions about them its very simple really
you will be assimilated
yes but before that happens could we ask you a few questions
we will answer
terrific all right hang on just a second here third of five
what is your designation
designation
third of five
you mean our names we dont have designations we have names im beverly this is geordi
do i have a name
do you want one
a name
im beverly hes geordi and you
you
you
no no wait a minute thats it hugh what do you think
you
no not you hugh
hugh
okay now im beverly
im geordi
we are hugh

now imagine what this shape would look like if it were turned inside out which one is it
this one
thats right hes gotten every one eight out of eight that blows the top right off the spatialacuity percentiles
its the prosthetic eye it seems to be giving him very complex visual information
like some kind of holographic imaging system
that could be helpful hugh id like to take a closer look at your eyepiece is that okay
here

thanks
when you are assimilated you will have a similar device
hugh do you understand we dont want to be assimilated
why do you resist us
because we dont want to live the way you do
here it is quiet there are no other voices
other voices
on a borg ship we live with the thoughts of the others in our minds thousands of voices with us always
i think what youre saying is that youre lonely
here

when you have completed these tests what will be done with us
well er well send you home
we will rejoin the collective

you know its funny when i first creating this invasive programme i didnt have a problem with it the more i work with hugh the more i
hugh
thats what we call him
you named the borg
well it was easier to have something to call him
oh so now you have a borg named hugh
right and hes nothing like what i expected
how so
i dont know its like hes just some kid whos far way from home
do you know that youre the second person today to refer to that borg as though it were some sort of lost child
anyway im having second thoughts about what were doing here i mean programming him like some sort of walking bomb sending him back to destroy the others
let me tell you something when that kids big brothers come looking for him theyre not going to stop until they find him and then theyre going to come looking for us and they will destroy us and they will not do any of the soulsearching that you are apparently doing right now
then why dont you go and talk to him it might not be so clear cut then
because i wouldnt have anything to say
then why dont you just listen that is what you do best isnt it

what is it number one
weve picked up a vessel on the long range scanners headed this way
analysis
the vessel is traveling at warp seven point six mass two point five million metric tons configuration cubical
the borg
its dimensions indicate that it is a scout ship similar to the one that crashed interference from the stars radiation will shield us from their sensors we should remain undetected until they enter the system
how long do we have
at present speed they will arrive in thirty one hours seven minutes

you dont look so tough
we are borg
arent you going to tell me you have to assimilate me
you wish to be assimilated
no but thats what you things do isnt it

resistance is futile
resistance is futile
it isnt my people resisted when the borg came to assimilate us some of us survived
resistance is not futile
no but thanks to you there are very few of us left were scattered throughout the galaxy we dont even have a home any more
what you are saying is that you are lonely
what
you have no others you have no home we are also lonely

what is geordi doing
im studying the components in your prosthesis
why
were trying to learn more about you
why
because youre different than we are part of what we do is to learn more about other species
we assimilate species then we know everything about them
yeah i know
is that not easier
maybe it is its just not what we do
why
all right think of it this way every time you talk about yourself you use the word we we want this we want that you dont even know how to think of yourself as a single individual you dont say i want this or i am hugh we are all separate individuals i am geordi i choose what i want to do with my life i make decisions for myself for somebody like me losing that sense of individuality is almost worse than dying
when you sleep there are no other voices in your mind
no
are you ever lonely
sometimes but thats why we have friends
friends
sure someone you talk to who will be with you when youre lonely someone who makes you feel better
like geordi and hugh


thats it captain
it looks harmless enough
we had to disguise it as something innocuous the borg have ways of screening out programme anomalies
how can a geometric form disable a computer system
the shape is a paradox sir it cannot exist in real space or time
when hughs imaging apparatus imprints this on his biochips hell try to analyse it
he will be unsuccessful and will store the shape in his memory banks it will be shunted to a subroutine for further analysis
then when the borg download his memory itll be incorporated it into their network then theyll try to analyse it
it is designed so that each approach they take will spawn an anomalous solution the anomalies are designed to interact with each other linking together to form an endless and unsolvable puzzle
quite original how long before a total systems failure
not until the shape has gone through several hundred computational cycles
when can you begin the process
about another twenty hours doctor crusher wants to make sure the new implants have taken hold
very well begin as soon as youre ready

captain i have to admit ive been having second thoughts about this plan
in what way
well ive been getting to know him the borg
i see
hes not what i expected captain hes got feelings hes homesick i dont know it just doesnt seem right using him this way
centuries ago when laboratory animals were used for experiments scientists would sometimes become attached to the creatures this would a problem if the experiment involved killing them i would suggest that you unattach yourself from the borg mister la forge
aye captain


guinan please come in
are you sure you look like youre preparing for a quiet evening
no im delighted to see you can i get you something to drink
no thank you i was thinking about how you said the other day that my foil was dipping that i should get some exercise and strengthen my arm
well a strong forearm is certainly an advantage in fencing
and bartending about the borg arent you the least bit surprised by him
surprised
did you know he has a name la forge gave it to him his names hugh and hes lonely i dont know what made me go see him la forge said i should but i said no and suddenly there i was standing there staring at him i thought it was just curiosity just curious i need to hear you say that you are sure youre doing the right thing
if youre here to persuade me not to use the invasive programme
no i think i need you to persuade me
two days ago you were so upset about the borg even being on the ship that you tore my foil out of my hand and now youre here questioning whether it should be treated as the enemy
no but when you talk to him face to face can you honestly say you dont have any doubt
i havent talked to it
why not
i saw no need
if youre going to use this person
its not a person damn it its a borg
if you are going to use this person to destroy his race you should at least look him in the eye once before you do it because i am not sure he is still a borg
because its been given a name by a member of my crew doesnt mean its not a borg because its young doesnt mean that its innocent it is what it is and in spite of efforts to turn it into some kind of pet i will not alter my plans
fine but if you dont talk to him at least once you may find that decision a harder to live with than you realise

worf to captain picard
yes lieutenant
we are ready to transport
proceed

lieutenant you may wait outside

locutus
yes i am locutus of borg
why are you here
this is a primitive culture i am here to facilitate its incorporation identify yourself
hugh
identify yourself
we are hugh
this is not a borg identification
third of five
this culture will be assimilated
they do not wish it
irrelevant
they will resist us
resistance is futile
resistance is not futile some have escaped
they will be found it is inevitable all will be assimilated
must geordi be assimilated
yes
he does not wish it he would rather die than be assimilated
then he will die
no geordi must not die geordi is a friend
you will assist us to assimilate this vessel you are borg you will assist us
i will not
what did you say
i will not assist you
i
geordi must not be assimilated
but you are borg
no i am hugh

i think i deliberately avoided speaking with the borg because i didnt want anything to get in the way of our plan but now that i have he seems to be a fully realised individual he has even accepted me as picard captain of this ship and not as locutus
so youve reconsidered the plan
yes to use him in this manner wed be no better than the enemy that we seek to destroy so i want other options
we could return him to the crash site wed have to remove his memory of being on the enterprise
but if we erase his memory who he is or who he has become would be destroyed
isnt that the point hed be reassimilated into the hive without any questions
does that seems right to help him become an individual and then take that away from him
is there any danger that the borg might destroy him if they find out whats happened
i doubt it thered be nothing to gain its more likely that they would simply wipe out his memory of those experiences
then either way his memory would have been erased
but perhaps in that short time before they purge his memory the sense of individuality which he has gained here might be transmitted throughout the entire borg collective every one of the borg being given the opportunity to experience the feeling of singularity perhaps thats the most pernicious programme of all the knowledge of self being spread throughout the collective in that brief moment might alter them forever we leave his memory intact
i have a question what if he doesnt want to go back

hello hugh
hello geordi
hugh a borg rescue vessel is approaching it will be here within three hours we can return you to the crash site where they will find you and take then you home or if you wish you can stay here with us
what i wish is irrelevant
its not irrelevant hugh it matters to us
no borg leaves the collective if they find i am missing they will come for me
well well deal with the repercussions later we must know what you want
you are many i am one what i want is not important
dont you understand hugh were giving you a choice
choice
yes a choice do you want to go back with the borg or stay with us
i could stay with you
we could grant you asylum hugh
choose what i want i would choose to stay with geordi but it is too dangerous they will follow return me to the crash site it is the only way
hugh think about this are you sure
yes

the borg ship will enter orbit in one hour youll soon be headed home well beam him down and then well take up a position in the stars chromosphere the interference will hide us from their sensors
goodbye hugh it was nice getting to know you
goodbye beverly you saved my life
hugh its not too late to change your mind
i must return
captain id like to go down with him
my experience suggests that they would ignore him would you agree
the borg assimilate civilisations not individuals
but captain they kidnapped you
because they needed a liaison to communicate with humans they ignored every away team we sent to their ship including yours doctor you may accompany him goodbye
captain i do not want to forget that i am hugh
energise

we found you there in the middle of that debris
then that is where i will wait

we are now entering position radiation levels are rising
increase power to the shields hold us here
status of the borg ship
solar radiation is rendering our sensors inoperable at last known course and speed the borg vessel should enter the system in three minutes

well i guess this is it huh so long hugh
goodbye geordi i will try to remember you

the next phase


time mister data
we will arrive within transporter range in three minutes twenty one seconds
 ive finally established audio contact with the romulan ship
 main power failing no way to stop the overload
enterprise to romulan vessel we are en route to your position
enterprise what is your time of arrival we are facing an imminent core breach
repeat your last transmission
im sorry captain theyve stopped transmitting
picard to riker

riker here
transport to the romulan ship as soon as were within range

aye sir no weapons we dont want them to think theyre under attack
this is not a bright idea
i beg your pardon ensign i didnt quite catch that
nothing sir



all main thrusters are shut down your information is unreliable the ah is inoperative give me a hand here

were from the federation starship enterprise we received your distress call
the enterprise
thats right your message said youd suffered a failure in your engine core
yes we had a forced chamber explosion in the resonator coil
its a pretty strange set up but it looks like the graviton field generator has been completely depolarised theres no way to fix it itll have to be replaced
where are your replicators
 they are offline
whos in charge here
the captain is dead im the science officer mirok
wed like to move the generator back to the enterprise for replication
all right
geordi you and ro
la forge to brossmer two people and one piece of equipment to beam aboard

aye sir

what the hell engineering i need more power to the primary energising coil brossmer to commander riker im losing them i have to abort

they should be returning to your coordinates sir
chief do you have them theyre not here
no sir
where are they

i cant locate their patterns

weve lost them sir

ive done all i can sir im afraid theyre gone
mister data begin a level one diagnostic all transporter systems offline until further notice could they have materialised somewhere else
negative captain sensors are unable to locate them anywhere within transporter range
counsellor

riker to enterprise
go ahead number one

captain were still looking at a core breach unless we can fashion a new graviton generator

i need replacement personnel sir
mister data you may continue the diagnostic of the transporter systems at another time take a shuttlecraft and two more engineers down to the romulan ship
aye sir
mister mcdowell alert the main shuttlebay to have all available ships and pilots standing by in case we need them
aye sir
ensign lay in a course away from the romulan vessel engage at warp one if you detect any sign its going to explode

pressure in the containment chamber has increased fifteen melakols in the last two minutes
what can we do to stop the overload
most of the conduits were damaged during the explosion i cant even access the central computer
commander emergency bulkheads have sealed this section off from the rest of the ship there is no way to gain access to the main bridge or control centres
survivors
readings indicate at least seventy three romulans are still alive
seventy three

the pressure has jumped two hundred melakols
ive lost control of the containment chamber
its going to implode
well need to dump the entire engine core do you have an autoeject system
yes but its not functioning ill have to do it manually
mister worf you two seal the chamber
implosion will occur in one minute five seconds
enterprise we need to jettison the entire engine core youll need to extend the shields once it clears the hull
understood number one well stand by for your signal

we must get the doors closed

commander
time
thirty seconds

im ready commander
stay there eject the chamber on my order
excuse me sir

implosion in five seconds
now

enterprise extend shields

well were still here
yes

well have a complete power survey done within the hour well probably have to supply them with energy for life support and theyll need a new engine core to get home
understood commander keep us informed of your efforts picard out ill be in sickbay
aye sir


ensign ro to the bridge this is ensign ro reporting in im at section twenty three baker near sickbay  sickbay


excuse me i need some help excuse me excuse me i need some help

excuse me i need some help

we shouldnt make any hasty decisions jeanluc the transporter couldve beamed them somewhere else the romulan ship another deck of the enterprise
weve already checked those possibilities the initial findings would seen to indicate that there was a radiation surge from the romulan engine core which disrupted the signal they never rematerialised
we should check again there might be something that weve overlooked and
beverly weve done everything that we can
youre right i just hate making out death certificates does ensign ro have any family
captain im right here
none that i know of but ill check with the bajoran liaison office
im not dead
ill have the official reports ready within the hour
captain i dont know whats going on

doctor doctor crusher doctor crusher im right here damn it


were ready commander
riker to enterprise begin power transfer

the power flow is consistent at four hundred kolems no fluctuations in frequency the main power grid is online
picard to riker
riker here power transfer appears stable at this end captain
good

what is the status of the engine replacement
engineering is modifying one of our subspace resonators to act as a new engine core it wont do more than warp two but itll get them home
very well
captain the diagnostic of the transporter system shows an anomalous energy fluctuation i will need to inspect the imaging scanner in transporter room three
by all means
captain i have a personal favour to ask i considered commander la forge to be my best friend i believe it is my responsibility to plan and conduct the memorial service may i have your permission to do so
permission granted make whatever arrangements you think are appropriate
thank you sir


commander the  the romulans want a computer we cannot give them access to federation technology that is an unacceptable security risk
what about a computer core from thirty or forty years ago one the romulans are already familiar with
that would be satisfactory
check with the enterprise see whats available be sure your concern are addressed before we install it
aye sir thank you


la forge
ro boy am i glad to see you and im really glad that you can see me its like im here but im not here
no one can see me either
i cant figure it out one minute we were transporting from the romulan vessel and the next i wake up in the arboretum with a splitting headache can you pass through things like bulkheads
tables people yeah

well were solid enough to each other
its not what you expected is it
what do you mean
this death
what
were dead geordi
is that some kind of a joke
our patterns were lost in a transporter malfunction we never rematerialised after leaving the romulan ship
wait a minute what are you saying that were some sort of spirits
spirits souls my people used to call them borhyas whatever term you want to use were it
but my uniform my visor are you saying im some blind ghost with clothes
i dont have all the answers ive never been dead before
we are not dead
according to doctor crusher we died in a transporter malfunction at fourteen thirty hours geordi i saw her make out the death certificates we need to make peace with our former lives thats what i was taught we have to say goodbye to the people who were in our lives
no you may be ready for the afterlife but im not
i dont see that we have much of a choice when i was growing up i never gave much thought to all the talk about borhyas i figured that it was just superstition passed on to children
fine you go make peace with yourself all right im going to transporter room three im going to figure a way out of this situation

i didnt have any warning that something would go wrong sir suddenly their patterns just werent there
i believe the cause of the accident may be related to the explosion on the romulan ship
really
but that happened before we even arrived
in all likelihood the explosion damaged the romulan cloaking device causing it to discharge chroniton particles i am detecting a chroniton field in here
a chroniton field
if the particles were produced on the romulan ship why are you detecting them here
the transporter beam
i suspect they travelled through the transporter beam that may have been the cause of geordi and ros death i will go to the romulan ship perhaps i can discover the source of the emissions
commander are these chronitons dangerous
they pose no danger to humans however some of the ships systems may be affected by prolonged exposure when i return i will devise a method to eradicate them
la forge to ensign ro 


thanks for the ride im here to say goodbye

there are a lot of what appear to be experimental engine components lying around over there id say they were testing a new warp drive design and it blew up in their faces

that would explain why theyre so far away from romulan space to avoid being picked up on federation long range scans
we should have an engine core ready for them by nineteen hundred hours
commander therell be a memorial service at twenty three hundred hours this evening mister data is making arrangements
ill be there
me too
in fact i might like to say a few words
you did know la forge longer than any of us
actually i was thinking more about ensign ro
me
when youre ready coordinate with mister data
wait a minute what are you going to say about me

captain i dont believe this im dead you cant even hear me and im still intimidated by you i just wanted to say thank you for trusting in me when no one else would
hey there you are excuse me captain listen datas taking the next shuttle over to the romulan vessel and we need to be on it
why
because i think what happened to us the answers are over there
why cant you just accept the fact
look if youre right then were dead and this doesnt make any difference but if im right then were still alive and im going to need your help

lieutenant i am planning a memorial service for commander la forge and ensign ro i would like you to participate
what kind of service
captain picard asked me to arrange a ceremony that was appropriate i have given a great deal of thought as to what is appropriate in this instance
sir shuttlecraft four has not yet cleared the romulan ship
hold position here
this is weird listening to them plan our funeral
i find i am having difficulty deciding what kind of service to have do you have any suggestions
human custom is to conduct a solemn dignified service in which the dead are praised by their friends and loved ones
ensign ro was bajoran her beliefs should be reflected as well however their death rituals are quite complicated
please not the death chant
the bajoran death chant is over two hours long
i am not certain that either human or bajoran rites are fitting and i have researched the funerary customs of over five thousand cultures to no avail
shuttlecraft four has just cleared
resume course in almost all societies it is traditional to say a ritual farewell to those you call friends i never knew what a friend was until i met geordi he spoke to me as though i were human he treated me no differently from anyone else he accepted me for what i am and that i have learned is friendship but i do not know how to say goodbye
he seems almost human doesnt he
commander i am not the proper person to advise you
why
i am very happy for commander la forge he has crossed over to that which is beyond for a klingon this is a joyful time a friend has died in the line of duty and he has earned a place among the honoured dead it is not a time to mourn
begin docking procedure
data thats a nice sentiment but a little premature i dont plan on being commemorated before my time


im afraid i fail to see the point of this investigation commander
chroniton emissions may have been responsible for the accident which claimed the lives of our officers
a most regrettable event of course
was your cloaking device damaged in the explosion
all of our systems were damaged including the cloaking device
that explains the chroniton fields i am detecting in here now for your own safety it is important to eliminate those emissions
our safety
there is no way to predict what will happen when the chronitons interact with the new engine core
ive never seen anything like this theres something in here that looks like a molecular phase inverter
whats that
its supposed to change the structure of matter so it can pass through normal matter and energy hang on a second a few years back we got intelligence reports that the klingons were working on trying to combine a phase inverter and a cloaking device in theory they believed that a phased ship could hide anywhere even inside a planet and that conventional weapons would be useless against it
how far did they get in their research
it never got out of the preliminary stages there were several accidents the romulans might be pursuing the same technology trying to combine an inverter and a cloaking device and if this is the prototype
then that would explain the explosion and the chroniton fields
and us
you mean were cloaked
not just cloaked phased our entire molecular structure altered so that we dont have any substance
then that would mean were not dead
yes it would also mean that theres probably a way to dephase us
the field emissions are particularly strong in this area

you can be assured that the emissions will be eliminated before the engine core is replaced
commander may i speak with you

if they come back theyre going to discover the interphase generator
is their power transfer beam still at full intensity
yes it will be until were ready to switch to internal power
we will set up a muon feedback wave inside the transfer beam the particles will accumulate in their dilithium chamber when they go to warp speed their engines will explode
weve got to get to the enterprise and warn them
how
i dont know but we have to find a way come on


the muon feedback waves not showing up on any of the engine displays
the romulans must be hiding it in a sensor return signal unless someone runs a level three diagnostic theyd never detect it there must be a way to warn them before the ship goes to warp
this is puzzling three more chroniton fields have formed aboard the enterprise in the last hour
theres no reason why the interphase device would be producing new fields aboard this ship
we should begin decontamination immediately run an internal sensor sweep for locations of all chroniton fields on the enterprise
aye sir the following areas are showing contamination sickbay transporter room three main bridge captains ready room shuttlebay two and main engineering
ro look at this
i do not understand how these new fields have formed no transporter beam has been active in any of those areas i cannot see that they have anything in common
oh yes they do
in fact they seem to be appearing at random
no theyre not we were in every one of those locations somehow were leaving chroniton footprints behind us
can you narrow the focus of the scan to pinpoint the locations
not with the internal sensors commander
go to science station two on the main bridge use a lateral sensor array to get a more precise reading i will modify an anyon emitter to eliminate the fields once theyve been isolated
why dont you go with her and see what the lateral sensors turn up ill stay here with data
right

well thats interesting youre reading chroniton readings in here but not from me theres a field in this wall why data i came through this wall i walked right through it when i came in here when the phased matter in my body passed through the wall it mustve disrupted the walls molecular structure producing a chroniton field data im right here thats me youre reading watch

come on its me you see


do not move yes i can see you
who are you
where is the scientific officer the one like us the one who came with you to our ship he spoke of a plan to return to normal yes this disruptor works i was wearing it when i was changed now where is he


data stop being so rational try using your imagination once in a while these arent just random patterns its me

hey watch where you point that thing wait a minute data i think you did something here  its not so easy to push through any more the molecules in my hand must have been partially dephased by the anyon beam data if a low level beam can bring my hand part of the way back maybe a high level beam can bring me all of the way back ill just have to get you to turn up the beam intensity so that hey wait a minute dont stop now no no no data dont give up on it it works i was just creating more fields your method is fine you just need to turn up the intensity data


hes in here



brossmer to commander data
data here
ive just detected a large chroniton field on deck seventeen the field strength is three hundred percent above the others weve found sir
is that ro
acknowledged


get up where is the science officer

ill go commander
excuse me for interrupting lieutenant
ro
im detecting a chroniton field in your room may i scan the area

certainly
thanks
any time

theres still no indication that the romulans set up a muon wave in our dilithium chamber
its there and when they go to warp
incoming message from the romulan ship captain
on screen
now what
installation of the new engine core has been completed we are ready to switch to internal power enterprise
understood disconnect the powertransfer beam
we are now on internal power captain picard please accept my sincere thanks on behalf the romulan empire
dont listen to him captain
it was our pleasure mirok and i hope that this example of cooperation between our two peoples will not be an isolated incident
as do i captain

set a course for the garadius system warp six
no captain wait
dont do it sir
captain im still running the decontamination programme mister data believes we shouldnt engage the warp drive until ive cleared all the chroniton fields from the ship
very well let me know when you finished your sweep
yes sir
if we can get to the locations that shes decontaminating maybe the anyon emissions would rephase us enough for someone to see us
yeah well the beam strength would have to be pretty strong in order for us to be visible for more than a millisecond somebodys going to have to be looking directly at us
then were going to have to go somewhere with an awful lot of people

its time sir we should go
you have the bridge mister mcdowell ill be at the service in ten forward
ten forward well thats perfect well create as many chroniton fields in there as we can get them to flood that room with a stronger beam

deck ten ive been thinking about the first time i met geordi la forge he was a young officer assigned to pilot me on an inspection tour and i made some off hand remark about the shuttles engine efficiency not being what it should and the next morning i found that hed stayed up all night refitting the fusion initiators well i knew then that i wanted him with me on my next command have you decided what youre going to say about ensign ro
yes i have it wasnt easy
situations like these are never easy number one ro why what wasnt easy what


what is going on here
its our memorial service
this
why not
i dont believe this they think were dead and theyre having a party
yeah its perfect come on lets get started

well this is unusual
yeah i think i like it

now i suppose ill never know what you were going to say about me

do you think the others will think this service appropriate
look around you data everybody is sharing their memories of geordi and ro laughing and talking what could be more appropriate than that
i am glad you approve doctor
brossmer to commander data
go ahead chief
im sorry to disturb you sir weve cleared the critical areas of chronitons but weve detected a new field forming in ten forward thats stronger than any weve seen before

should i wait until after the service is over before beginning decontamination
no

no anyon emissions are harmless please begin immediately
aye sir
here we go

worf worf can you see us
lieutenant
were right here worf damn
we have to find a way to increase the emission strength
yeah i know
if she hadnt lost her rank as a result of that incident at garon four i think she wouldve made lieutenant commander by now
bridge to captain picard
go ahead
incoming message from garadius four sir the diplomatic situation is deteriorating they want an update on our eta
stand by ensign
weve got to do something now before they go into warp
the disruptor i can put it on overload
do it
lets go

i would like to get under way as soon as possible the situation on garadius four is becoming serious
i see no reason to delay our departure the chroniton fields have been cleared from all critical areas

excellent mister mcdowell will you set course for garadius four and engage at
commander data chroniton field strength in ten forward has just increased by three thousand percent
curious captain i believe we should decontaminate this room before getting underway
very well
chief
yes commander
increase anyon emissions to six thousand particles per second and decontaminate this area
okay hang on

data can you see us
captain were right here
were right here were right here

did you see that mister data
yes sir
come on data put it all together now
these were not ghosts what did we see
i believe i may know what has happened sir
data please be right
it would explain the mysterious chroniton fields
yes yes yes
if they were cloaked in some way
are you saying that theyre still alive
if i am right sir they are and in this room their brief appearance coincided with the anyon sweep perhaps the anyons neutralise the cloaking effect chief brossmer
yes commander
set the anoynic beam to its highest level and flood ten forward
aye sir

data do you see us
of course
la forge to engineering take the warp engines off line until further notice theres a muon wave build up in the dilithium chamber
captain who gave that order
that was commander geordi la forge ensign please follow his instructions
aye sir
it looks like a great party do you mind if we join you
geordi it is good to see you
thanks data ive never been to a better funeral

could you pass the rolls
youve been eating for over an hour
come on we didnt eat for almost two days im hungry whats wrong
nothing
come on
i was raised with bajoran beliefs i even followed some of the practices but i never really believed in a life after death then suddenly i was dead and there was another life and it made me feel like id been pretty arrogant to discount everything id been taught you know now i dont know what to believe
maybe we should develop our own interphase device if it can teach ro laren humility it can do anything
the inner light

captains log stardate  following a magnetic wave survey of the parvenium sector weve detected an object which we cannot immediately identify


magnify mister data
it appears to be a probe of some kind but there is no starfleet record of this shape or design
is it scanning us
no sir but it has assumed a relative position and it is holding course with us
the probe is composed of paricium and talgonite a ceramic alloy
not a very sophisticated technology
sir i am detecting a lowlevel nucleonic beam coming from the probe
shields up stand by phasers
the beam is scanning the shields perimeter the probe is emitting an unusual particle stream
sir the beam is penetrating our shields
increase power to

captain captain ive got you its all


well finally how are you feeling kamin can you answer me
what is this place
youre still feverish
computer freeze programme computer end programme
kamin
picard to enterprise
kamin please dont get up yet youre still not well
i asked you what is this place
this is your home of course
am i a prisoner here
please dear youve had a high fever for three days you mustnt push yourself too quickly kamin you really shouldnt go outside


kamin please come back inside



thank you this sapling is planted as an affirmation of life in defiance of the drought and with expectations of long life whatever comes we will keep it alive as a symbol of our survival kamin youre back on your feet how do you feel my friend
are you in charge here
in charge
i want to be returned to my ship immediately
what ship is that
please just tell me what is this place where am i
the fever its taken your memory
that must be it perhaps you can help me
anything my friend
my name is kamin
yes
and you are
batai council leader batai
ah batai and you say ive been ill
for more than a week eline shouldve put you in the hospital but she insisted on caring for you herself
eline
your wife if you dont remember that maybe its safer not to go home
and what is this place
perhaps you should see the doctor
no please im sure it will all come back to me
this is the community of ressik northern province
what planet
let me take you back home
no really im quite all right just answer me what planet
this is the planet kataan
kataan not a federation planet i think ill just take a walk
but youve been ill for a week
the exercise will do me good ill try to reacquaint myself with the surroundings



thank goodness ive had people out trying to find you everywhere why did you worry us like that are you hungry
hungry thirsty exhausted i suppose that proves this is not a dream doesnt it
you think this your life is a dream
this is not my life i know that much
ive kept something hot for you where did you go
i walked for hours
and youre just out of bed

its delicious
you always say that
would you try to answer some questions for me no matter how strange they may seem to you
of course
are there other planets in this star system do you visit other systems all right do you have a communication system here how do you send messages to other communities to other places
the usual way by voicetransit conductor do you want to send a message
yes when can that be arranged
tomorrow dont you want to ask about us
of course anything you can tell me will be helpful were er um married
three years ago the happiest day of my life was the day we got married
and what do i do here in ressik
youre the best iron weaver in the community at least i think so you prefer playing the flute of course
the flute
yes

and when did i learn to play it
im afraid you never did dear but you keep trying

i see what you mean well thank you for the soup thank you for your help tomorrow will you help me send a message
of course will you come to bed
oh ill sleep here
kamin please come with me
ive been sick ill be tossing and turning it wouldnt be fair to you
let me be the judge of that
where did you get this
kamin this is the first gift you ever gave me

riker to sickbay the captains hurt

pulse and blood pressure are normal im getting hyperactive fibrogenic activity this is odd
what is it
theres no evidence of any injury or trauma vital signs are normal but neurotransmitter production is off the scale whats going on
that probe is doing something to him anything yet data
no sir the particle emission is most unusual i am unable to block it
we should destroy the probe phasers are armed and ready
i dont think thats wise not until we know exactly what its doing to him
agreed stand down phasers mister worf in the meantime take us out of range ensign thrusters only one hundred kph nice and easy
aye sir
data
the probe is moving with us sir holding relative position
its connected itself to him like a tether

youve been dreaming of that starship of yours again havent you
im just charting progress of the course of the sun it might give a clue to the cause of this drought
i think youre still trying to figure out where you are where that ship of yours is how to get back to that life
the memory is five years old now but its still inside me
was your life there so much better than this so much more gratifying so much more fulfilling that you cling to it with such stubbornness
eline
it must have been extraordinary but never in all of the stories youve told me have you mentioned anyone who loved you as i do
it was real it was as real as this is and you cant expect me to forget a lifetime spent there
yes i can ive been patient kamin for five years ive shared you with that other life ive listened ive tried to understand and i have waited when do i get you back
i know i know it has been hard on you
when will you let go when will you start living this life when will we start a family
kamin eline good morning
good morning batai
are you ready the administrators already arrived
yes will you come along
no thank you you do very well on your own
she always was strongminded even when she was a child
its not her fault these past few years have been very difficult for her
and for you i think

there you are batai perhaps you can explain to me when crops are dying all over how this tree is flourishing
this tree is our symbol our affirmation of life everyone in this town gives part of their water rations to keep it alive weve learned administrator that hope is a powerful weapon against anything even drought
a good point perhaps i shall recommend a symbolic tree in each of my communities now what business do we have today
we need help if were to increase the water supply we think there are ways to reclaim some of our water
batai youre being a bit of an alarmist true we are in a drought but water rationing has produced a sizeable savings
if the weather pattern doesnt change rationing will not be enough well run out of water
who is this
kamin sir
kamin do i know you
no i havent spoken to you before
well kamin im open to all the people of this town im delighted to hear what you have to say
i suggest that we build atmospheric condensers which could extract water from the air
i dont mean to quash your very creative ideas but building atmospheric condensers would be a monumental undertaking we could not hope to sustain such a project
each community would be responsible for its own condensers could make the difference between watering our crops or watching them die
well ill be glad to pass along your idea youll see that this kind of participatory government works for everyone be well batai i shall see you next month good to meet you kanin
go carefully administrator

that went very well i think he was impressed with you
but therell be no atmospheric condensers
these things take time but it will happen im sure of it
come and have supper tonight my friend ill make some vegetable stew lets talk about building our own condenser
kamin hearing you talk to the administrator i realised that for the first time in years you were speaking as though you were truly a member of the community it was good to hear that again


youve been brooding behind that flute all evening
im not brooding im immersed in my music
music
i find that it helps me think but the real surprise is i enjoy it so much
no the real surprise is that you may actually be improving
batai
yes maam
go home
yes maam goodnight kamin
goodnight my friend
go carefully batai

dont forget these  i wont put them away for you again
yes maam
ive done nothing but nag all day im sorry
no im the one whos sorry everything you said this morning was absolutely correct i feel that i have given you so little and you have given me so much
no youre a good man a wonderful husband i didnt mean
no not such a wonderful husband i spend my spare time charting the stars i disappear for days at a time exploring the countryside my life is very much as it was old habits
youre gentle and kind you never once raised your voice to me
id like to ask your permission to build something
kamin youve built your telescope your laboratory you dont need my permission for something new
in this case i think i do
what is it
a nursery
really really
unless of course if you would prefer a porch it would certainly be easier to build i could make a start on it right away
no


geordi any progress identifying the probe
maybe ive picked up some residue on the probes shell i think it came from the propulsion system looks like it used a solid propellant as fuel
solid propellant
sensors read this stuff as crystalline emiristol it produces a radioactive trail that ought to be traceable
then we should be able to send out a probe of our own trace it back to the origin
ill get right on it
commander i have been analysing the nucleonic beam i believe it would be possible to reflect the particles back toward the probe in a way that would disrupt the signal
doctor
i simply dont know the risk of shutting down the beam
im not willing to let this thing keep drilling into him
if somebody gets stabbed you dont necessarily pull the knife out right away it might do more harm than leaving it there
the captain is under attack we must act
im inclined to agree doctor monitor him closely mister data prepare to disrupt the beam were going to try to cut this cord


meribor


meribor this is your brothers ceremony dont fidget now
we name this child for a dear friend who died a year ago but now his memory will live on in his namesake
we name you batai in his honour
and hes starting out in the warmth of friends thank you please help yourselves to something to eat
congratulations kamin
thank you
it seems like only yesterday we had meribors naming ceremony go on
i remember i was so nervous i was afraid that i would drop her now look at the little lady
shes no lady tromping through the hills with you all day digging up those soil samples you insist upon collecting no shes her fathers daughter
i would have believed i didnt need children to complete my life now i couldnt imagine life without them
kamin what is it

get the doctor hurry

his respiratory systems in spasm pulse is irregular and weakening
im losing him
im getting massive somatophysical failure
two ccs delactovine
data get that beam back
there are severe fluctuations in the isocortex synaptic responses are failing
begin full cardiac induction
blood pressure is dropping rapidly seventy over twenty
data youve got to reestablish that beam
i am attempting to do so doctor
losing response in the isocortex
cortical stimulators start at ten percent
the beam is fully restored doctor
blood pressure up to ninety over forty and rising
isocortical functions are stabilising vital signs are approaching normal

meribor
 happy day father
hey thats my hobby find your own
youre the one who taught me dont complain if youve turned me into a scientist
and what has the scientist been up to today
analysing soil samples there isnt any anaerobic bacteria the soil is dead this isnt just a very long drought is it father i have entries in my log that go back ten years you have data preceding that for fifteen years youve reached the same conclusion i know you have
i havent reached any conclusion a good scientist doesnt function by conjecture
a good scientist functions by hypothesising and then proving or disproving that hypothesis thats what i did
hey why dont you spend more time with that young fellow dannick
you are changing the subject
no im not im just hypothesising that hes in love with you
youve taught me to pursue the truth no matter how painful it is its too late to back off now this planet is dying
perhaps i should have filled your head with trivial concerns games and toys and clothes
i dont think you mean that
no i dont it just saddens me to see you burdened with the knowledge things you cant change
father i think i should marry dannick sooner rather than later dont you
seize the time meribor live now make now always the most precious time now will never come again
i love you father

his vital signs are holding theyve been stable ever since the beam was restored
commander riker weve started to receive telemetry from the probe we launched
go ahead
weve charted the alien probes radiation trail for over one light year
any way to extrapolate am origin
looks like a star system in the silarian sector kataan
never heard of it data
it is an unmapped system of six planets sir
any of them inhabited
not any longer sir the star went nova all life in the system was destroyed approximately one thousand years ago


i put away your shoes for you again
yes thank you dear
you know ive been looking through this thing off and on for over thirty years and i still dont see what you and meribor find so fascinating
fine then maybe youll sit down and have a rest like youre supposed to
you treat me like some frail flower people have surgery all the time

he loves playing hes quite good at it dont you think
he loves doing a lot of things too many last week all he wanted to do was be a botanist the week before that a sculptor i wish he could find some focus in his life
i think he has maybe you should talk to him
batai
father
i get the feeling from your mother that you have something to tell me
yes i was waiting for the right moment but that will never come im leaving school
leaving school no youre not
i want to concentrate on my music thats what i care about
last year all you cared about was mathematics the year before that botany now
through it all there was my music i think you know that father this is the life i want
well well discuss it
thank you father

even after all these years you still have the ability to surprise me
if music is what he wants why should i stand in his way anyway who knows how much time hell have to follow any dream
are you still planning to talk to the administrator tomorrow
theres a possibility hell dismiss me from the council
unless of course you keep quiet
no the evidence is too pronounced i cant stay silent
what a surprise

times arrow part 

captains log stardate  the enterprise has been recalled to sector zero zero one on a priority mission all weve been told is that evidence has been discovered indicating the presence of extraterrestrials on earth five centuries ago

work crews were down here installing seismic regulators when they found some remarkable artefacts
and its been determined that they date back to the late nineteenth century
yes

the bifocal vision aid is typical of the era the weapon is a forty five calibre doubleaction cavalry pistol invented by colt firearms in 
here look inside the watch

what makes you think that extraterrestrials are related to these discoveries
the crew was having a problem with the regulators something inside the cavern was interfering with the phase conditioners it turned out to be the cavern itself

the composition of the exposed rock face has been altered by exposure to triolic waves
which youre not going to find on earth in either the nineteenth or twenty fourth century
triolic waves
the byproduct of an energy source employed by very few species because of its deleterious effect on living tissue
weve confirmed that no one has been in or out of this cavern in centuries so were left with a five hundred year old mystery
im curious doctor there are far greater experts on earth to investigate your mystery why bring the enterprise all the way home
as we continued our excavation we found one other thing i havent shown you yet weve tried to leave everything as we found it

captains log stardate  we have transported the materials discovered in the cavern back to the ship for analysis i wish i could be as dispassionate about the implications as my second officer

interesting there is a twelve percent decomposition of the bitanium in the neural pathway links that suggests the alloys are vulnerable to
data how can you look inside that analyse the decomposition without
emotion sir
yes
i am simply trying to make an objective assessment
data is this yours
i believe so sir
could it be lore
no sir my brothers positronic brain has a type l phase discriminating amplifier mine is a type r
type r
yes sir
can you predict how long this has been in the cavern
decomposition strongly indicates that life was terminated approximately five hundred years ago that would be consistent with the other artefacts we recovered
your head is not an artefact
in relative terms perhaps not nevertheless it seems clear that my life is to end in the late nineteenth century
not if we can help it
there is no way anyone can prevent it sir at some future date i will be transported back to nineteenth century earth where i will die it has occurred it will occur
well i cant tell you exactly who the aliens were but i have found out a few things the triolicised rock face tells us were probably dealing with a species with microcentrum cell membranes triolic waves wouldnt harm them it also might mean theyre shape shifters of some kind
so they could have appeared on earth as humans
i dont think its anyone weve run into before nothing we found matches up with any known lifeforms what does match up is a cellular fossil which might have been along just for the ride
a cellular fossil
a microscopic ciliated lifeform not unlike a thousand other singlecelled lifeforms youd find on any planet surface except this particular one is lb one zero four four five and lb one zero four four five is only known to exist on one place devidia two in the marrab sector
number one lay in a course
on my way

so do you want to talk about it
are you referring to the foreknowledge of my death
yeah
i have no particular desire to discuss the matter do you need to talk about it
yeah
why
data this has got to bother you a little
on the contrary i find it rather comforting
comforting
i have often wondered about my own mortality as i have seen others around me age until now it has been theoretically possible that i would live an unlimited period of time and although some might find this attractive to me it only reinforces the fact that i am artificial
i never knew how tough this must be for you
tough as in difficult
knowing that you would outlive all your friends
i expected to make new friends
true
and then to outlive them as well
now that you know that you might not
it provides a sense of completion to my future in a way i am not that different from anyone else i can now look forward to death
i never thought of it that way
one might also conclude that it brings me one step closer to being human i am mortal
picard to bridge officers were approaching the devidia system report to your stations
ill see you later lets get together for a game of chess or something okay

that sounded like a very intense discussion
yeah they found datas head a mile beneath san francisco been down there about five centuries
thats why the enterprise has been sent back to earth i didnt realise
its something isnt it he seems fine about it better than i am well id better get to engineering

full circle

i heard about data
yeah
its having an unusually traumatic effect on everyone
yeah
if you dont want to talk about it its okay
im fine im just
angry
im not angry yeah im angry why should i be angry
maybe because it reminds us of our own mortality
i just dont want to believe it
have you ever heard data define friendship
no
how did he put it as i experience certain sensory input patterns my mental pathways become accustomed to them the inputs eventually are anticipated and even missed when absent
so whats the point
hes used to us and were used to him its like finding out someone you love has a terminal illness and

data
counsellor commander

would either of you mind if i made a personal inquiry
personal inquiry no go right ahead
i am perceiving an apparent change in the way others behave toward me for example people abruptly end conversations when i appear just as you did when the turbolift doors opened is that an accurate observation
not at all
 yes
yes
youre right data and its not a very nice thing to do
its just that our mental pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns
i understand i am also fond of you commander and you as well counsellor

were in orbit
any sign of life
negative sir
captain sensors are picking up an unusual temporal disturbance on a small area of the planets surface forty two degrees seven minutes north by eighty eight degrees declination east
temporal disturbance
put us in a standard orbit above those coordinates
spectral analysis shows a high level of triolic waves emanating from the same location
any correlation with the readings from earth
affirmative sir the magnetic signature is identical to the one found in the cavern
would these triolic waves be dangerous to humanoids
only with long term exposure sir there is no immediate threat
take an away team
worf geordi troi join me in transporter room three for an away team
commander
mister data ill need your help to monitor the sensor readings during this investigation

captain may i speak to you alone

sir it is standard procedure that the second officer accompany the away team
yes yes mister data i am aware of that
then i must assume your decision is related to the discovery on earth of
i think it is reasonable to take precautions
captain there is no rational justification for this course
then ill be irrational
it is possible sir that the events leading to my death will not occur for years even centuries
i hope thats true mister data nevertheless this investigation began with your death i am simply trying to see that it doesnt end that way
i appreciate your concern captain but to employ an aphorism one cannot cheat fate
cheat fate perhaps we cant mister data but at least we can give it a try


the concentration of triolic waves falls off about here it increases exponentially the closer in we go
whats the source something underground
negative commander
whats the explanation
i dont have one yet la forge to enterprise
go ahead
data run a spectral field correlation for me lets find out if these triolic readings are in any way related

to the temporal distortions
acknowledged


deanna
theres life here a child an old woman dozens more hundreds terrified
terrified
my god will theyre human

whatever they are trois convinced theyre human they may be trapped somehow were not sure
captain the results of my temporal analysis may be pertinent
go ahead
geordi it indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating

triolic waves
that explains a few things how much data
a positive displacement of point zero zero four percent
well whatever or whoever is there were out of phase with it but were only talking by a fraction of a second
a fraction of a second would make them invisible
a millisecond a year it wouldnt make any difference if what were reading is true then were occupying the same space but in a different time
how do we compensate
commander we might be able to

manipulate the synchronic distortion
maybe if we were to create a contained subspace force field

but to get a point zero zero four variance wed need an incredibly sensitive phase discriminator data i dont think weve got one that would come close
yes we do

it is built into my positronic decompiler it will be necessary for me to join the away team sir
 proceed mister data

mister data
sir
let me give you a hand with that data

once i have adjusted the forcefield i will no longer be visible commander i have taken steps however to ensure that you will still be able to hear me if you would assist me in a test of the comm system my voice will be transmitted on a delay correlated to the phase adjustment that should allow me to maintain verbal contact
will we be able to talk to you
no sir that will not be possible
the subspace field has been established youre set to go data
adjusting the synchronic distortion point zero zero one point zero zero two  point zero zero three point zero zero four
i have made visual contact there are lifeforms here

theyre either unaware of me or choosing to ignore me i am moving approximately ten metres north of my starting position to observe more closely

they range from two to three metres in height silver grey in colour they have four limbs no eyes or ears are noticeable there is a single orifice where a humanoid forehead would ordinarily be they are reclined against the rock face surrounding an apparatus of some sort approximately one point five metres in height

it is releasing what appear to be energy fragments which are then ingested by the entities through the orifice perhaps some sort of nourishment

the upper portion of the apparatus seems to be a holding facility for the energy segments there are hundreds perhaps thousands of these fragments inside i have resumed a northerly direction there is no evidence yet of humans
okay thats enough data come on back now
i have encountered

another lifeform an ophidian it seems to be restricted by a forcefield

two of the silvergrey entities are approaching it they have released the forcefield

i am reading a temporal distortion of massive proportions the ophidian is cap  timespace continuum

caught in the after effect i am attempting

data
over here
commander riker report
weve lost him


excuse me pardon me i am searching for two individuals with an ophidian a snake
frenchman

could you help out a forty niner i fell down a shaft i got blown up in a tunnel
that is unfortunate
it is most unfortunate i require large amounts of whiskey as a linament
i am sorry but i have no whiskey to give you
ill take a dime
i am sorry but i have no form of legal tender
well were in the same boat huh well this is my street youll have to go find one of your own
i would be happy to do so but i am presently in need of information
stockbrokers are cheap as hell dont even bother to ask your best handout is from a young fella with his lady you give him a chance to show her hes generous steer clear of sailors most likely youll get a fist across the jaw for your trouble
thank you for your advice but im trying to find two individuals with a snake
a snake youre an odd fellow arent you but just dont be too particular where you get your funds from
you are in need of medical attention i will get a doctor
no no no its too late for that  could you help out a forty niner

 thanks

hey put it on gentleman jim knockout in the fifth
all right
sir i need temporary lodging
looks like the missus booted you out in the middle of the night
i understand the source of your misperception however this is not sleepware and i do not have a missus
well
i am a frenchman
oh well everybodys from somewhere that doesnt matter at this hotel its six bits a day or four dollars a week
i have no money
well now that matters
but i am capable of performing significant tasks both mental and physical perhaps your hotel would offer me a job
geez i dont know were pretty happy with the maid weve got cooks decent dishwashers drunk all day but at least he gets here on time and theres me i do everything else sorry  lady luck not with ya tonight mister lane poor fella hasnt filled a straight in five weeks
poker


fold
me too
go to blazes 
a poker face carved in marble
excuse me gentlemen
what in hell do you want
i would like to join the game
pale face
i dont like easterners personally
i am a frenchman
ah mes parents sont originaires de bourgonais je suis ne a la new orleans
alors nous sommes presque frres je suis heureux de vous connaitre
please sir

the game is poker the deal is yours the ante is four bits

family heirloom
in a manner of speaking it is a crystalline composite of silicon beryllium carbon seventy and
gold
gold
ill give you three bucks for it
i accept 


did you see the looks on their faces i did everything i could not to laugh
to whom are you referring
frederick la rouque and joe falling hawk those guys are card sharks oh sure they play easy at first not to scare off the marks but you give them a little time theyll bleed a man dry especially an outoftowner like yourself
what was the source of your jocular reaction what was it you found humorous
dont you see they had you pegged for a sap the clothes you got on the way you talk its like you were born yesterday you sure fooled them though
it was not my intention to deceive
have it your way this is the place breakfast is six to eight checkouts at noon when youre ready to leave

thank you  it has been a pleasure

it would be advisable to monitor that cough i have read that there is currently a cholera epidemic in san francisco
never felt better
of course the gratuity thank you for your assistance
a dollar if theres anything you need it can get lonely in san francisco you might want some company i can introduce you to lillian
i have no need for companionship however i do require some supplies
anything you need i can get it for you wholesale i can get it for you less than wholesale if you dont ask me where it came from

what do you need all this stuff for
i am an inventor
no kidding well this stuffs going to take a while ill have to go clear cross town and its not going to be cheap

will this be enough
more than enough
you may retain the surplus for yourself
keep the change
exactly
done


help out a forty niner fell down a shaft forty niner help me help me out

no no

captains log supplemental close range sensor analysis has yielded no further trace of commander data despite the emotional repercussions among my crew i must move this mission forward

im not willing to accept that hes dead and just leave it at that
we cannot make mister data our priority
what is more important than data
look at what we have so far evidence that these aliens have been travelling back in time to earth
what if theyre trying to undermine our history for some reason
some kind of guerilla war
we must assume that there is a threat if not to us then to th century earth we have to determine what that threat may be mister la forge we have to find some way to communicate with these life forms
its not going to be easy to reproduce what data did we can create a contained subspace field but wed need an extraordinarily sensitive phase discriminator to get that point zero zero four variance
can you build one
it wont be as good as datas
will it be good enough
i dont know i can try its going to take some time though
i dont want anyone else going in alone
i can probably create a large enough subspace field to encompass everyone but adjusting the phase inside the field thats going to be the hard part
make it so
we have to assume one thing sir wherever data may be hes doing the same thing we are which is trying to get to the bottom of this he may have a better idea about whats going on than we do so it might be in the best interests of this mission to find him
perhaps in the course of this investigation we will i hope so
if we find commander data it may be our fate to die with him in the past if our remains are in that cavern they would have turned to dust long ago


im afraid to interrupt
captain you didnt have to come all the way down here i wouldve been more than happy to come up to you
and miss all this i havent seen such a complex operation since the academy lab final in exochemistry
its a tzartak aperitif its very very touchy the trick is to change the evaporation point of the main ingredient you want the temperature where the liquid goes to vapour to be a half a degree below the body temperature of the customer that way when the liquid touches the tongue it evaporates and the flavour is carried entirely by the vapour a few molecules off the vapour point crashes and poof its all gone all of it
what is it you wanted to see me about
i hear youre sending an away team down to the surface are you going
well now this is rather unusual for you to be curious about an away mission
maybe its an unusual away mission
if you have something to say im listening
starfleet captains dont usually accompany away teams
its general policy
this time you have to
why
you just do do you remember the first time we met
of course
dont be so sure i just mean if you dont go on this mission  well never meet

in a sight reminiscent of
city on the edge of forever
 data has built a contraption the bellboy staggers in with an anvil
sorry it took so long mister data
apology is not necessary

ow
are you all right
i believe i have overexerted myself
yeah ill say did you get it working
yes
whatever it is
this is for your trouble
what are you going to do with the anvil
i require a low intensity magnetic field core i believe the iron mass of the anvil will provide that
whats it going to be when its finished
what do you think it is going to be
if i were to guess maybe a new kind of motor for one of those horseless carriages
that is a good guess
hot damn you really think theres money in those things
perhaps
isnt that what makes america great
to what are you referring
well a man rides into town in his pajamas wins a grub stake at a poker table turns it into a horseless carriage and makes a million bucks thats america
i believe i have given you an erroneous impression
you know some day my ships going to come in
you have a ship
oh yeah and its full of gold too im just biding my time til it gets here raising a stake any way i can ive been a newsie cut fish at a cannery heck ive even been an oyster pirate
you have had a considerable spectrum of occupations
yeah well you cant stay in one place too long im always looking for the angle you know say maybe you and i could go into business together selling your horseless carriage and all you invent them i sell them i can sell anybody anything what do you say
i believe your plan is a bit premature
keep it in mind though i better get back oh i forgot i got you something at the bakery on third

thank you jack
oh no no no its on me partner


the eminent scientist alfred russell wallace has revived the theory that earth is at the centre of the stellar universe this distinguished natural philosopher has reaffirmed our planet as the only habitable globe in the heavens a world furthermore constructed for the sole benefit of man hes got a lot of folks excited about the notion
my dear mister clemens why do i think youre not one of them
your suspicions madam guinan are undoubtedly based upon your keen observational skills now if youll permit me ill continue my character assassination unimpeded
my dear mister clemens please do please do
according to our best geologic estimate the earth is approximately one hundred million years of age perhaps it is less perhaps more
perhaps a great deal more
indeed but regardless it is ancient in the extreme now geology also tells us that man himself has existed for but a microscopic fraction of those years curious isnt it that the world got by for such a great long while with no humans around to fill up space i suppose mister wallace and his supporters would say that the earth needed all that time to prepare itself for our illustrious arrival why the oyster alone probably required fifteen million years to get it to come out just right
but if the earth is not alone and there are millions of inhabited planets in the heavens
quite my point man becomes a trivial creation does he not lost in the vastness of the cosmic prairie adrift on the deep ocean of time a single one among countless others
someone may argue that a diamond is still a diamond even if it is one amongst millions it still shines as brightly
someone might say that dear lady if someone thought that the human race was akin to a precious jewel but this increasingly hypothetical someone would not be me

good afternoon sir
good afternoon i would like to speak to guinan
and you are
data
mister data could it be under another name
no
i cant seem to find your name on the guest list sir
i am a personal friend
madam guinan has discovered many personal friends since the newspaper announcement but if your name is not on the guest list theres nothing i can do
it is urgent that i speak to her
sir unless you leave this house immediately i will send for the police
that is an excellent idea i will wait for them in there

sir please you cant go in there

guinan excuse me i must speak to you immediately
forgive me madam he just barged right in
i am sorry for the disruption but he would not believe me when i told him we were friends
do i know you mister
data yes we were on a ship together
i do so much travelling what ship would that be
the enterprise
is that a clipper ship
it is a starship
a starship what registry would that be
of course mister data excuse us we have so much to catch up on excuse us how are you

what exactly are you
android artificial life form
ah did my father send you here because if he did you must go back and tell him ive not done listening
i was not sent by your father circumstances demand that i take you into my confidence i require your assistance

sorry
i am from the twenty fourth century where you and i serve aboard a starship
and
our ship encountered a species who appears to be threatening th century earth i investigated and was inadvertently pulled into their temporal vortex when i saw your photograph in the newspaper i assumed you had joined me from the future from the enterprise i knew your species was longlived but i did not realise you had visited earth so long ago

eavesdropping is by no means a proper activity for a gentleman nonetheless the deed is done
captains log stardate  an away team has beamed to the surface with a device which may enable them to phaseshift into the alien world

okay counsellor right over there

the triolic waves end right here

mister worf

sir
how soon will you be ready
were ready now captain the subspace field is established
id be more comfortable if youd monitor our progress from the bridge captain
i have reason to believe that my presence on this mission is imperative
imperative
yes mister worf you will report back to the bridge
sir as chief of security my place is at your side
the security of the enterprise is of paramount importance mister worf
yes sir worf to enterprise
go ahead
beam me up

proceed mister la forge
ive modified this tricorder to interface with the subspace generator it should allow me to control the phase discrimination assuming this is going to work at all i need everyone within the field adjusting synchronic distortion point zero zero one point zero zero two  point zero zero three point zero zero four
if we can see them why they cant see us
the phase displacement might not bring us far enough into their perceptual range
these strands appear to be biomagnetic variable flux possibly organic in origin
a life form
no there is no life here what i have sensed is more like an imprint an echo of the last moment of life human life they all died in terror

my god theyre delivering more of them for the others to ingest
look at what hes carrying

to be continued
times arrow part 

last time on star trek the next generation
they found datas head a mile beneath san francisco been down there about five centuries
at some future date i will be transported back to nineteenth century earth where i will die it has occurred it will occur
do i know you mister
data yes we were on a ship together the enterprise
is that a clipper ship
it is a starship
starship
my god theyre delivering more of them for the others to ingest
did my father send you here because if he did you must go back and tell him im not done listening to
i was not sent by your father our ship encountered a species who appears to be threatening nineteenth century earth
im not willing to accept that hes dead and just leave it at that
we cannot make mister data our priority
what is more important than data
do you remember the first time we met
of course
dont be so sure if you dont go on this mission well never meet
and now the conclusion

i have long been interested in the notion of time travellers in fact i wrote a book about it it chronicles the tale of a man of our era who fouled the sixth century by introducing newfangled gadgets and weapons all in the name of progress this idea of time travel is not so far fetched as it might seem in fact i have learned that even now there are people from the future right here in san francisco and i have no doubt that their intent is to foul our world just as my yankee did in king arthurs time well sir let me serve notice as soon as i have the necessary evidence i intend to expose them and make it absolutely clear that they are not welcome here
yes sir and will this be a sequel to connecticut yankee mister twain
the names clemens son sam clemens thats with an e
with an e got it

excuse me


 the coroner said this is where they kept all the cholera victims
 it doesnt make sense that so many people are dying of cholera it just isnt that virulent will this is strange
what is it
the cerebellum the cerebral cortex the brain stem the entire nervous system has been depleted of electrochemical energy heres another one same neural depletion these people did not die of cholera they died because their neural energy was drained somehow
drained and taken to devidia two for those aliens to ingest if you were a time traveller with a taste for human neural energy where would you get your supply
i would travel back to a time when there were plagues and epidemics so i could murder and use disease as a cover


over half the victims whose neural energy had been drained came from the sisters of hope infirmary
a charity hospital near the waterfront
if the aliens have been killing people there well someone might have noticed something unusual
and if theyre moving among humans they must have taken on human form but the question is how do we know who were looking for
the tricorder indicated triolic activity from most of the bodies we looked at if the aliens left that sort of signature theyll be detectable
you know we might even be able to rig some kind of alien alarm system
any luck contacting data
none the tricorders broadcasting random emissions on all frequencies his subprocessors might pick up but the range is limited almost anything could interfere

shes back

mister pikerd
yes mrs carmichael
 mister pikerd ill be reminding you that its one oclock
yes
one oclock on a thursday im sure i made it clear to you that the rent is always due payable in full by one oclock on wednesdays
ah yes er the rent mrs carmichael even now my troupe are in rehearsals for a new production
oh i havent heard of any new production what play is it
the play a midsummer nights dream we have performed in london paris milan milan to sold out houses i assure you you will have the rent in full with a bonus
oh no no no no ive heard you silvertongued devils before ill have the rent in full tomorrow by one oclock or youll be out performing on the street

i wouldnt do this for just anybody mister clemens and i hope you wont spread it around that i let you in people start talking

of course not jack and i assure you that mister data would be most upset if you didnt if i cant find that letter of intent that he left me our major investor is going to pull out and take his business elsewhere
it has to do with mister datas engine doesnt it
engine
yes
oh yes yes this is exactly what its all about ow

you know mister clemens im going to do you another favour today youre always looking for good stories right well ive got a real humdinger for you the story of my life now i know you may think im young but ive covered a lot of ground and if i do say so myself itd make for some pretty fascinating reading so what do you think
about what
about writing my life story you and me literary partners of course
young man i have a maxim that i have always lived by no one is more qualified to write your story than you are
me be a writer you think i could do that
as long as you write what you know you got any passions boy any dreams
id like to do some travelling maybe go to sea and alaska ive had the strangest notion to go see alaska
thats a great idea son thats exactly what i would do if i were your age alaska the klondike the aurora borealis thats it follow your dreams and write about em
thank you mister clemens you know that is exactly what im going to do
you do that son
youll see my name in print too
im sure i will
dont forget the names london jack london
goodbye now byebye

i found the head surveyor i found the cavern you will not be able to get to it the entrance is on a mine shaft that is the middle of the presidio on an army base
perhaps you could arrange for us to get in
how
with permission to dig for the mine shaft
oh no data ive done everything youve asked
i have full confidence in your persuasive abilities
well i suppose its more interesting than throwing a tea dance
strange the transceiver assembly has been removed without it i will be unable to track the time shifts
twain
clemens
yes hes been driving me crazy he watches the house he follows me down the street asking me questions if anyone took this you can believe it was him
if you are correct he must be warned the device has been modified in such a way that prolonged contact with human tissue would be highly toxic

madame guinan mister data
shame on you mister clemens shame
shame madam i think not i find no shame in my efforts to uncover your plot
i keep telling you there is no plot
yes you do keep telling me that what an interesting pair you are where in switzerland did you say you were from mister data
i am french sir not swiss
oh yes thats right now i remember a frenchman with a talent for poker from what i hear you know i was talking to a friend of mine ches whitley he says to say hello and wonders when youre coming back
i do not believe i know mister whitley
no he works at the county assayers office he says youve been in there a number of times claiming to be a geological engineer and wanting information about mining operations during the s you remember him now
i am unfamiliar with the gentlemans name i have spoken to several people at that office
yes i know and in the hall of records and in the geological society and a littleknown mineral shop in chinatown you do get around dont you
as apparently you do mister clemens
i must admit youve got me mystified this contraption for instance its very unusual it looks quite futuristic tell me might it have something to do with time shifts
in a sense the time shift is a gearing system i have invented for the horseless carriage
do not insult me you have come here to this century and brought your infernal technology with you for god only knows what purpose but i have no doubt it will be the people of this century who will suffer for it
my dear mister clemens i do think weve heard enough mister datas business is his own and i will thank you to leave now
pardon me madam guinan but it is my business too it is the business of all humanity i believe to stop both of you from whatever it is you are doing here and that is what i intend to do


just what are you doing with those lamps
replacing the burners city ordinance makes it safer in case of earthquake
there hasnt been an earthquake here in thirty years
well thats takes care of this ward time to be moving on

earthquakes nurse  if you can handle things here ive got a meeting with the board of patrons
ill try to manage

there by that bed i can see an afterimage of triolic waves theyve been here recently id say within the last twenty four hours
thats the bed where the man died last night
this man was complaining about a strange doctor and nurse who visited that patient perhaps theyre still in the hospital

 here thisll make you more comfortable

do you need any help doctor doctor apollinaire felt he had entered the algid stage he was cyanotic pulse unobservable thats an interesting cane

doctor


stand aside stand aside let me in here people said there was gunfire in here whats going on
just a little misunderstanding i was just clearing these people out of here
i havent seen you before
i was just assigned here this morning i was working downtown
i worked downtown for three years i dont remember you
well be on our way
no wait wait im going to ask all of you to come down to the station for questioning including you whered you get that thats a gentlemans cane never seen a cane like this before ill have to confiscate it for evidence
i just want you to know that i have the utmost respect for the law

lets go


data

boy are we glad to see you
i suggest we postpone our greetings for another occasion
agreed get us out of here


if we tune a phaser to the approximate frequency of triolic waves and lay down a field burst it might respond

the ophidian the aliens were carrying

what the
these look like minute distortions in the spacetime continuum like the one we saw on devidia two
they were so small and they lasted only a second
the aliens appear to be able to concentrate the distortion and direct it to a specific time and place
maybe they have something a mechanism that focuses it
any device like that would produce significant levels of triolic waves like the ones in the cavern where datas head was found
i have located that cavern

mister pikerd i know youre in there open the door
mrs carmichael
how now spirit whither wander you
over hill over dale thorough bush thorough brier
mrs carmichael thank goodness youre here
we need someone to read a part youre just in time
mister picard i need to be talking to you
my mistress would that he be gone
ill met by moonlight proud titania
now mrs carmichael right there
ill met by moonlight proud titania
what jealous oberon fairies skip hence i have foresworn his bed and company
well i dont think i need to hear any more that was truly unique
really
ladies and gentlemen i think we have found our titania dont you agree

well i did do a church play when i was a lass
well there you are we start rehearsals tomorrow



youre back i have wonderful news ive found a way to get into the presidio and into the mine shaft

it is all right
do you know me
very well
do i know you
not yet but you will

thanks for your help officer
now be sure you put in the part about me spotting that phony policeman
yes sir
hello son
mister clemens what brings you here
writers curiosity i heard that two people vanished into thin air in this infirmary
one of the patients said that yes sir but the police deny it
i bet they do
they say a band of outlaws set off an explosion in the hospital and then escaped
well what did these outlaws look like
the carriage they escaped in was driven by an albino
oh mister data
you know him
you bet i do you say there were others with him
yes at least a dozen
his accomplices theyve come from the future my god its an invasion

an invasion from the future mister clemens what can you tell me about this do you have any proof
whens your deadline boy
five oclock sir
ill meet you at your paper at four thirty with a story that will make your career
thanks mister clemens
take me to the presidio driver and dont spare the whip

the triolic levels are as high as they were on devidia two theres no indication of a control mechanism
im not so sure my visor is picking up crystalline fractures these cavern walls have undergone some kind of selective molecular polarisation in fact if im right this whole cavern has been configured to focus the spacetime distortion just like a lens captain we think we might be on to something the cavern itself seems to be acting as a focusing mechanism im willing to bet its the same at their habitat back on devidia two
if we can get back there and destroy that site it might put an end to their time travelling
we have the ophidian
truthfully i dont know that we can get back the aliens use triolic energy as a power source the energy our phasers generates might not be entirely compatible
we have no choice but to try
an event i would most certainly enjoy witnessing however i will regretfully waive that opportunity for the privilege of taking you all in to the authorities
mister clemens it is imperative that we continue our mission
mister data i have listened to your stories and your excuses and your evasions and i will listen no longer it is my moral duty to protect mankind from whatever devious plan you have in mind now move along i suspect that even time travellers are vulnerable to the colt forty five now lets go i made a young fellow a promise and i dont want to be late

follow him


is everybody all right
i think so
you
where are we and when
this is the twenty fourth century were on devidia two and youre not supposed to be here
well it seems to me i have as much right to be in your time as you had to be in mine i wanted to see how youve conducted my future affairs
your future affairs
the affairs of mankind
but the disappearance of mark twain one of the most noted literary figures of the nineteenth century
thank you
thats not supposed to happen
i only took advantage of an irresistible opportunity as any good writer would
bridge to away team acknowledge
were here mister worf stand by to transport five
commander

mister worf
yes commander
make that six to transport

where are we now
the federation starship enterprise ensign call security i want an escort for this man
security what for are you afraid im going to go around stealing things

a werewolf
its a long story mister worf ill brief you later
lets have datas body taken to the science lab ill try and reattach the head we have
geordi that head is over five hundred years old
yeah but its the best chance weve got
i want mister clemens kept under escort at all times
commander perhaps i could handle that id be happy to take mister clemens to his quarters
good idea if you would accompany the counsellor
madam id be delighted so this is a space ship you ever run into halleys comet


gently dont sit up too quickly
whered everybody go
i hope theyre all safely back on the enterprise by now
but youre still here
you were hurt i had to make sure you were all right
and so you stayed for that
i didnt want anything to happen to you youre far too important to me
you know an awful lot about me
believe me in the future the tables will be turned
so we become friends
it goes far beyond friendship
oh but ill have to wait almost five hundred years and when we meet i wont be able to tell you about this will i
no because for me none of this will have happened yet
whats that

thats history fulfilling itself

history has to fulfill itself even picard knew that
you were there in the cavern you know what happened what am i supposed to do
if i told you what happened in that cavern it would affect any decision youd make now i cant do that i wont
not telling me might affect my decision did you think of that were talking about jeanluc picard i cant sit around and hope it all works out ive got to do something


any place that doesnt stock a good cigar doesnt rank high in my book
if you must have one im sure we can replicate it for you
you think one of these imitations can take the place of a hand wrapped havana
i wouldnt know
well thats the problem i see here all this technology it only serves to take away lifes simple pleasures you dont even let a man open the door for a lady
i think what weve gained far outweighs anything that might have been lost
oh well im not so impressed with this future huge starships and weapons that can no doubt destroy entire cities and military conquest as a way of life
is that what you see here
well i know what you say that this is a vessel of exploration and that your mission is to discover new worlds


thats what the spanish said
deck thirty six
and the dutch and the portuguese its what all conquerors say im sure thats what you told that blueskinned fellow i just saw before you brought him here to serve you
hes one of the thousands of species that weve encountered we live in a peaceful federation with most of them the people you see are here by choice
so therere a privileged few who serve on these ships living in luxury and wanting for nothing but what about everyone else what about the poor you ignore them
poverty was eliminated on earth a long time ago and a lot of other things disappeared with it hopelessness despair cruelty
young lady i come from a time when men achieve power and wealth by standing on the backs of the poor where prejudice and intolerance are commonplace and power is an end unto itself and youre telling me that isnt how it is anymore
thats right
well maybe its worth giving up cigars for after all


any luck
not so far his activating units wont initialise i thought they would have been protected by his buffering programme but i guess five hundred years is just too long a wait
my watch
yeah it was found in the cavern where datas head was i guess after five hundred years thats not likely to work either
mister data i fear i sadly misjudged you as i have misjudged many things


can you communicate
yes
youre injured
why have you interfered with us
you hunt us you kill us we cannot allow that
we need your energy
perhaps we can find a substitute
no there is none we must continue
we know how you move back and forth through time my crew have returned to the twenty fourth century to destroy your transport site on devidia two
destroy it your weapons will only amplify the time distortion you will annihilate your own world


im going back for captain picard mister worf assemble an away team to accompany me to the surface doctor i need to know anything you can tell me about that ophidian
ive just started running some tests if i can have a few hours
i cant give the alien any more time
will i havent been able to determine if our phaser energy can generate a stable field the risk would be
ill take that risk
sir permission to speak frankly
go ahead
our priority is to stop the aliens from any more incursions to earth any delay is unacceptable
if i can save captain picard i consider that very acceptable
the captain would not i recommend we target photon torpedoes on the alien habitat and destroy it immediately
hes right will
power up the photons mister worf alert me when theyre ready

computer initialise the reload circuits
reload circuits are initialising
okay data this ought to do it

i dont get it i dont understand why isnt this working computer run me a diagnostic on the input polarisers
there is intermittent contact in the input polarisers
intermittent

what an iron filing howd that get in there



commander i have set the photons to fire in staggered rounds detonating in ten second intervals
very well fire when ready
the sequence will be ready to initiate in one minute

computer run another diagnostic on the input polarisers
polariser circuits are functioning
well then that ought to do it okay data come on now
torpedoes phasing alien i am processing a binary message entered into my static memory by captain picard geordi are we planning to fire on the alien habitat
yeah but
it is imperative that we do not i will explain later
la forge to riker hold your fire

the binary message left by the captain is not entirely clear he seemed to be concerned about the phase differential of our photon torpedoes that firing them might produce catastrophic effects
then how do we destroy their habitat
if i am correct we must modify our weapons so that the force of the explosion is rephased into the aliens time continuum
if we outfit the photons with phase discriminators we could get the variance we need
how long will it take you
at least a couple of hours
fine ill have time to go get him
sir
im going back to the nineteenth century to get the captain doctor
my analysis of the phasers suggests youd be able to open the rift but it wont be stable enough to transport more than one person
you mean if i go back only one of us can return
thats right
then i have the perfect solution for you im the one who should return to the nineteenth century and remain there so your captain can return here
theres a risk were not sure how stable the rift will be
theres risk in everything the point is its the right choice ive got more books to write and your captain has a job to do here
geordi youll brief him on what he needs to know
aye sir
im glad i have the chance to thank you
for what sir
why for starting me out on the greatest adventure a mans ever had and for helping a bitter old man to open his eyes and see that the future turned out pretty well after all

im thirsty
im going to get help we have to get you out of here
no dont go theyll be back for you soon
no you need help
this thing put me down in the middle of market street took forever to get here

commander la forge has completed the reconfiguration of the photon torpedoes
if clemens got back the captain should have been here by now
we have no way of knowing if mister clemens was successful
reestablish your firing pattern mister worf well wait five more minutes
aye sir

no time for chit chat sir according to mister la forge who did get your message by the way a frequency setting of point oh four seven on your phaser will correctly activate this creature
now you have to get help guinan needs medical attention
i promise you she will be attended to
and there is a bill to be settled at mrs carmichaels boarding house
ill settle it
thank you i wish i wish time would have allowed me to know you better
youll just have to read my books what i am is pretty much there
ill see you in five hundred years picard
and ill see you in a few minutes

commander i am picking up massive triolic wave activity on the surface
is it the captain
there are no human life signs
no sign of a temporal distortion
no sir but triolic activity is increasing
the aliens mister worf are the photons ready
yes sir
fire
torpedoes away sir
sir i am detecting a temporal distortion on the surface and human life signs
obrien get him out of there

transporter room have you got him
he has indeed commander and believe me its good to be back
we have destroyed the target there is no further indication of triolic activity
ensign lay in a course to the nearest starbase warp six
captains log stardate  everyone who should be in the nineteenth century is safely there and those who should be in the twenty fourth are here mister data has been restored to us head and all and samuel clemens will write the books he was to have written after our encounter

now be careful boys dont jostle her too much dont worry madam guinan youre going to be fine

realm of fear

captains log stardate  we have located the uss yosemite a starfleet science vessel sent to the igo sector to observe a remote plasma streamer the ship has not been heard from in several days

magnify

the last report we have says they were observing the streamer at medium range maybe they went in for a closer look got more than they bargained for
hail them
no response
life signs
our scanners cannot penetrate the plasma streamers distortion field
can we tractor them out
no sir ionic interference is too heavy
ill take a shuttle in
too risky you could be pulled in too bridge to engineering

mister la forge can we beam an away team onto the science ship
we can beam them over there captain but with all this interference we might not get a positive lock to bring them back
commander if we bridged our transporter system with theirs we might be able to cut through the ionic field
thats a good idea barclay captain i think we can do it were going to bridge the two transporter systems
acknowledged meet commander riker in transporter room three
aye sir barclay im going to need a systems engineer on this away team
ill ask ensign dern to join you
i meant you barclay
shouldnt i stay here and set up the remote link
dern can do that come on lets go

status mister obrien
ill have to send you over one at a time commander because of band width limitations and the transport cycle will take a little longer
how much longer
four five seconds about twice the normal time im afraid youre in for a bumpy ride commander
what do you what exactly do you mean by a bumpy ride
there may be a small amount of static charge accumulation youll feel a bit of tingling its nothing to worry about
lets do it mister worf

engaging system interlock pattern buffers synchronised phase transition coils at stand by energising hes there
ill go next

engaging interlock buffers synched energising
im ready
engaging interlock buffers synched oh wait a minute im reading an ionic fluctuation in the matter stream oh no problem okay energising
reg youre up reg
aye sir
engaging interlock buffers in synch phase coils
im sorry i just cant do this



reg you were faced with a difficult transport anyone would have been apprehensive in that situation
tell that to commander la forge and the rest of the away team
im sure they understand as soon as you feel up to it you can probably still join them
no
reg is there something youre not telling me
actually this isnt the first time ive been apprehensive every single time that i tried to do it i had a certain feeling i guess you could call it mortal terror
why have you kept it a secret
why because my career in starfleet would be over thats why
i doubt that
ive always managed to avoid it somehow you wouldnt believe how many hours that ive logged in shuttlecraft i mean the idea of being deconstructed molecule by molecule its more than i can stand even when i was a child i always had a dreadful fear that if ever i was dematerialised that i would never come back again whole i know it sounds crazy but
its not crazy about it you are being taken apart molecule by molecule reg youre not the first person to have anxiety about transporting we can desensitise you to this type of fear its a slow and gradual process but it works
it does how
well you might first try a relaxation technique like plexing
plexing
yes its a betazoid method the next time you feel nervous about transporting you stimulate a neural pressure point like this

theres a nerve cluster just behind the carotid artery it stimulates the part of the brain that releases natural endorphins
plexing sounds easy enough

here there
you know i feel better already i think i can do this
theres no need to rush
no no we talked about confronting my fears the best way out is through you said that once remember
i suppose i did
im going to beam over there i can do it


theres no sign of any survivors no sign of anyone
maybe they abandoned ship
unlikely the escape pods are still on board
there was an explosion that much we do know
any idea what caused it
ive ruled out a reactor core failure and theres no sign of a systems overload
blast analysis indicates the explosion originated here in the centre of the transport chamber
how is that possible the transporter is still functioning
could they have beamed an explosive device aboard
commander riker could you come here please
excuse me


lieutenant joshua kelly he was the ships engineer
how did he die
he has second and third degree burns over most of his body but i dont think they were the cause of his death im like to take him back to do an autopsy

youre sure about this sir
sure please proceed
itll only take a minute it should be a smooth ride over
good good
i know how you feel about this sir
youre afraid of transporting too
no arachnids sickening crawly little things dont you think all those legs
spiders theyve never bothered me
a few years back i was called in to reroute an emitter array at a starbase on zayra four turns out the entire system was infested with talarian hook spiders you ever seen a talarian hook spider their legs are half a metre long well i had a choice do i walk away and let the emitter blow itself to hell or do i crawl in the jeffries tube with twenty hook spiders
what happened
it was the hardest thing i ever did but i got through it after that i was never quite as afraid of spiders
thanks
energising

reg welcome aboard you ready to work
yes sir
good why dont you start by downloading the ships science logs over there
aye sir
still four members of the crew unaccounted for did you come up with anything
i dont know how these fit in but i found them all around the transporter platform
what are they
they look like pieces of a standard sample container
take them back to the ship analyze them there mister barclay glad you could join us
me too sir

the ferengi are claiming two of their freighters were destroyed by a cardassian warship in your sector
is there any evidence to support this
although im loathe to believe the ferengi about anything there was evidence of cardassian weapons if the cardassians also attacked the yosemite it could indicate a large scale movement into this sector
i have an away team on board the ship the initial report indicates there was an explosion on board but were not sure if it was from an attack
how soon until you know
a few hours if it looks like cardassians ill contact you immediately
very well

bridge to captain picard
go ahead mister data
the away team is returning to the enterprise sir
acknowledged have commander riker come to my ready room as soon as hes on board
aye sir


la forge to transporter room three im ready to go
stand by commander


barclay to enterprise one to beam back
stand by sir


you see sir that wasnt so bad was it

mission logs science logs medical logs theyre all scrambled looks like the blast wiped out the ships core memory
we could try to reconstitute the data stream
its worth a try
commander has anything strange ever happened to you during transport
like what
i dont know anything out of the ordinary
no not really this looks hopeless were not going to get anything out of these logs you know maybe this broken sample container i found can tell us something lets try to get this thing back into one piece
i mean have you ever seen anything
where
in the during transport
sometimes my visor picks up resonance patterns from the matter energy conversion its actually kind of pretty why
just wondering
reg what are you getting at did you saw something during transport
when i was returning to the enterprise i couldve sworn i saw something in the matter stream
something
there was phased matter all around at first i thought it was some kind of energy discharge but then it flew toward me and it touched my arm how could something be in there molecules flying apart half phased i mean its impossible isnt it
wed better check it out when were done here well run a full diagnostic on the transporter all right
all right

the confinement beam subsystems check out so do the phase transition coils
the pattern buffer is fine
emitter pads targeting scanners theyre all working fine this systems clean so is the science vessels
reg theres a lot of energy floating around in the beam maybe you saw a surge in the matter stream
yeah
ill run a scan on the heisenberg compensators
no chief youve done enough already
its no problem why dont you give me a hand
you know maybe ignorance really is bliss
sir
well if i didnt know so much about these things maybe they wouldnt scare me so much i can still remember the day in doctor olafsons transporter theory class when he was talking about the body being converted into billions of kiloquads of data zipping through subspace and i realised theres no margin for error one atom out of place and poof you never come back its amazing people arent lost all the time
with all due respect sir ive been doing this for twenty two years and i havent lost anybody yet
yes but you realise if these imaging scanners are off even a thousandth of a percent
thats why each pad has four redundant scanners if any one scanner fails the other three take over
reg how many transporter accidents have there been in the last ten years two three there are millions of people who transport safely every day without a problem
ive heard of problems what about transporter psychosis
transporter psychosis there hasnt been a case of that in over fifty years not since they perfected the multiplex pattern buffers
reg transporting really is the safest way to travel


id like to take a closer look at those burns take a tissue sample please
yes doctor
damage to the epidermis only initiate a circulatory probe
doctor crusher
his hearts beating cardiostimulator now its gone
neuroelectrical activity in the cerebral cortex nothing
now the respiratory systems active what the hell is going on



water ten degrees celsius computer access starfleet medical database tell me about er describe the disorder transporter psychosis
transporter psychosis was diagnosed in the year twenty two oh nine by researchers on delinia two
no no stop all i need is what causes it
it is caused by a breakdown of neurochemical molecules during transport affecting the bodys motor functions autonomic systems and the brains higher reasoning centres
what are the symptoms
victims suffer from paranoid delusions multiinfarct dementia hallucinations
hallucinations what kind of hallucinations
victims experience somatic tactile and visual hallucinations accompanied by psychogenic hysteria peripheral symptoms include sleeplessness accelerated heart rate diminished eyesight leading to acute myopia painful spasms in the extremities and in most cases dehydration
computer what is the treatment for transporter psychosis
there is no known treatment

the autopsy showed residual ionisation in every one of lieutenant kellys systems i think thats what caused the muscular and systemic contractions
from where did the ionisation come
theres evidence of electrical burns on the victims body as if he was exposed to ionised gas or high energy plasma
plasma theres no way they couldve been exposed unless it was matter from the streamer
is there evidence of a hull breach could plasma from the streamer have found its way into the ship
no data whats the report on that broken sample container
the analysis of the fragments is not yet complete
captain if theres evidence of similar ionisation in those fragments it could mean they tried to beam aboard material from the streamer
if the plasma exploded that would explain a few things let me know when the analysis is complete
aye sir


from the looks of these fracture patterns id say that the explosive force came from within the container
the container does show evidence of residual ionisation i believe your hypothesis was correct it was used to store high energy plasma
so they were collecting samples from the plasma streamer they had the proper container how could it have exploded
perhaps we should attempt to recreate their experiment to see what happens when matter is beamed aboard under similar conditions
thats a good idea well prepare a new container reg i dont want to take any chances here start setting up a level five containment field here in engineering okay
aye sir
are you all right lieutenant
im fine yes thank you

geordi lieutenant barclay appears inordinately preoccupied with his physiological condition i have seen him check his pulse rate as well as his visual acuity several times over the last twenty minutes
thanks data

reg
yes sir
you okay
im just fine sir
you look a little pale
i do
look reg its been a long couple of days why dont you get some rest weve got everything under control here
i think ill do that sir thank you

la forge to counsellor troi
go ahead commander
counsellor do you have a minute

lieutenant barclay ive been calling you why havent you responded reg what are you doing
im walking

i can see that where are you going
nowhere i just dont get to these decks very often look theres stellar cartography i thought that was deck eleven
mister barclay
i was i was having trouble sleeping and im trying to wear myself out it is a perfectly normal thing to be doing isnt it
commander la forge said you seemed a little nervous this morning
im always nervous everybody knows that
he also mentioned that you said you saw something in the transporter beam
well i was wrong they checked the transporter and there wasnt i mean there was nothing there i imagined the whole thing
you dont sound very convinced of that
listen counsellor i really appreciate your concern in this matter but i really wish you wouldnt continue this conversation im really perfectly fine
mister barclay youre exhausted and highly agitated and i cannot allow a member of this crew to endanger himself and others i think
im not endangering anyone else and i wish you would
i think it would be in your best interest to take a leave of absence reg im temporarily relieving you of duty
fine fine do what you have to do counsellor


computer more birds  end stress reduction programme water
specify temperature
i dont care just give me water

calm calm stay calm  all right computer lets try some music something soothing


sir begging your pardon but couldnt this wait til the morning
no chief ive just ive been reviewing the transport logs what are these energy variations that keep appearing there was one when i transported to the science ship you see
theyre just ionic fluctuations sir a result of our interlock with the yosemites transporter system
a fluctuation occurred while i was inside the matter stream
its nothing to worry about sir
i need you to transport me to the science ship and then directly back again and while im in the beam can you recreate one of those ionic fluctuations
i guess so but if you dont mind my asking sir what for
i need commander la forge wants some tricorder readings on those fluctuations
we can do that from right here
no i the transporter sensors may not be sensitive enough im giving you an order mister obrien
aye sir if you dont mind my making an observation sir you forgot to bring a tricorder
either theres something in there or im going crazy and ive just got to know you can understand that cant you
yes sir i can stand by sir

i want you to wake the senior staff


then i saw it again just twenty minutes ago it was the same exact thing just moving around in the transporter beam
let me get this straight you think this thing was alive
it was dark and distorted and it had what looked like a mouth
a mouth
i dont see anything wrong with his arm
reg why did you wait so long to tell anybody about your arm
well i thought i was hallucinating that i had that it was transporter psychosis but now i know what i saw in there was real i was the only one who experienced ionic fluctuations in the transport maybe thats why no one else saw it
mister barclay ive been told youve been under a considerable amount of strain the past couple of days isnt it possible that you simply imagined
i know what youre going to say captain i know ive been acting strange lately but youve got to believe me i would never have called you in here unless i was absolutely certain
commander la forge get mister obrien take that transporter system apart piece by piece if you have to mister worf i want a level three security alert until further notice
aye sir
ill run a microcellular scan of mister barclays arm it might take some time but if theres a problem ill find it
keep me apprised dismissed

im reading minute levels of residual ionisation in the subdermal tissue of his left arm the patterns correspond exactly to those we measured in lieutenant kellys body and in the sample container from the science ship theres no question you have been exposed to the same high energy plasma they were
so something did happen to me in the transporter beam
you mightve been exposed to something from the science ship you did say something touched your left arm during transport and thats exactly where the ionisation is focused
does this ionisation pose a threat to mister barclay
it might ill have to run a base pair correlation to see if theres any sign of dna breakdown
sir commander la forge and i were planning to recreate the circumstances of the explosion on the yosemite that might give us some answers permission to continue with the experiment
granted tell mister obrien to take all the primary transporters offline i dont want to risk any further contaminations make sure you take all the necessary safety precautions
aye sir
id like you to wear this monitoring device it will tell me if theres the slightest sign of increased ionisation

yes doctor

structural reinforcement is at two hundred forty percent

activating containment field well that should do it okay reg weve locked onto the coordinates of the plasma streamer go ahead and beam aboard a sample will you
aye sir

okay what would they have done first
a standard analysis begins with a resonance frequency scan
that sounds like a good place to start lets get it done
initiating resonance sweep frequency range at three

barclay check the containment field
the field is at its maximum limit but it is holding
my visors picking up biomagnetic energy highly complex patterns you know i think these things are alive reg

reg  reg

life forms
that is correct they appear to be quasienergy microbes that exist within the distortion field of the plasma streamer
we didnt detect them until we tried to run the resonance frequency scan apparently they didnt like it very much they shattered the sample container
which caused a plasma explosion similar to the one on the science ship
exactly when we linked up with their transporter system one or more of the microbes must have got into our system we think theyre still caught in the buffer it might explain what you saw
but what i saw was much bigger than a microbe
normal spatial relationships are often distorted within the matter stream your perceptions may have been exaggerated
some of these microbes are also in your body reg
inside me
they were in lieutenant kellys body as well thats what caused the contractions during the autopsy
the biofilter should have screened them out but it didnt
the microbes exist simultaneously as both matter and energy the biofilter cannot distinguish them from the matter stream
right but if we held barclay suspended in midtransport at the point where matter starts to lose molecular cohesion
the molecules would begin to emit nucleonic particles we may be able to derive a pattern the computer would recognise
and then reprogram the biofilters to screen the microbes out i think thisll work reg
suspend me i dont like the sound of this
wed have to hold you in there for a while
how long
thirty forty seconds its tough to tell but i think itd be safe
but if im in the matter stream too long
your pattern would degrade to the point where your signal would be permanently lost


after fifteen seconds or so in the beam you may start to feel lightheaded try to stay calm oh and its important not to move around too much
right
initialising the backup pattern buffer holding at stand by
ready reg
energise
molecular resolution at sixty percent engaging static mode his pattern is locked and holding
starting biofilter scan

signals holding
the imaging scanners still havent isolated the microbes
ill try increasing molecular dispersion
his signal resolutions dropped to fifty five percent
dont worry i can hold him together

commander the signal resolutions down to fifty percent we need to bring him back
i know i know just give me one more second we need more dispersion increase phase transition frequency
aye sir
the imaging scanners are actuating
got it pattern acquisition positive
programming biofilter
dont worry reg this wont hurt a bit

im reading a ninety two percent increase in mass
theres something in the beam with him security to transporter room three
right away
im setting up a force field round the chamber

drop the force field

there are more crew members in the beam you have to grab them and hold on
understood follow me
reg what happened
well when i saw there was more than one of them i thought maybe the other crew was trying the same thing that we were
were infected with something lieutenant kelly tried to reprogram the biofilter
it looks like he pushed molecular dispersion past the integrity point your patterns got caught in the beam
the residual energy from the plasma streamer it mustve amplified the charge in the buffer enough to keep your patterns from degrading

captains log stardate  the reprogrammed biofilter was effective in removing the alien microbes from mister barclay and the four crewmembers the microbes have been returned to the plasma streamer

chief
lieutenant im glad you could make it you know i think this is the first time weve ever spoken outside of the transporter room
well to be honest i always avoided you
why
because you run the transporters and i hate the transporters at least i used to so whats in the box
i thought you might like to meet christina christina lieutenant barclay
its your pet spider
lycosa tarantula dont worry she wont bite

shes very large
i found her on titus four almost stepped on her by accident oh ill get us a couple of drinks okay keep an eye on her will you
sure

er chief
man of the people

captains log stardate  we have been called to the aid of a transport ship which has been attacked near rekagseronia hostilities between the two factions on that planet have intensified recently threatening an important federation shipping route

captain sensors have located the transport ship two rekag battle cruisers are flanking it
red alert shields up
phasers online photon torpedoes armed and ready
is the transport still under attack
the cruisers weapons are powered up but sir the rekag ships are turning and heading out of sensor range
they dont want to take on the enterprise
we are within visual range of the transport sir
on screen
sensors indicate damage to the dorians subspace emitter audio communication only
open a channel mister worf
aye sir
this is captain jeanluc picard of the federation starship enterprise
captain talmadge of the dorian glad youre here we took some shield damage from the rekag ships but were still intact
do you have injuries can we assist you in any way
no injuries but id like permission to transport a couple of our passengers to your ship
of course
were conveying a mediator to seronia i think hes the reason the rekags fired on us hes 
captain im losing you go ahead and beam your passengers on board counsellor after youve seen to their needs will you escort them to my ready room
yes captain
cancel red alert mister worf take the weapons offline
aye sir


im counsellor deanna troi
ambassador ves alkar and my mother sev maylor counsellor its imperative that i speak to the captain
you think hes attracted to you but he isnt you offer him nothing
she hasnt been feeling well could she be taken to quarters
of course chief ill take you to captain picard
mother go with her
dont pursue him i wont have it ill stop you

i am grateful for the federations offer to escort me but if i arrive at rekagseronia on board the enterprise the armed flagship of starfleet my mission as negotiator of peace will be compromised there must be a federation transport ship somewhere in the area that could take me there
with all due respect admiral to put the ambassador on board another unarmed transport would be to invite a second assault
i believe the attack on us was an isolated incident nothing more
ambassador alkar the rekagseronia dispute has threatened federation ships for many months we are grateful that you are willing to undertake this mission and you have our full support
thank you sir
however we also recognise that safety is an issue not just yours but the crew that escorts you to send you on an unarmed transport puts everyone at risk i think it best if you proceed to rekagseronia aboard the enterprise
then i have no choice
once you get to rekagseronia you can conduct your negotiations as you see fit until then youll be in good hands with captain picard
i understand sir
good luck and a successful journey

picard to commander riker
yes sir
set a course for seronia
aye sir


that will be all for today there will be another class tomorrow at oh seven hundred hours
the skills are demanding youre very disciplined
i believe in a strong connection between body and mind you obviously share the same convictions
yes i do only sometimes my body has a problem conforming to my minds wishes

i would imagine that your selfdiscipline helps you in your work
i dont know about that i think maybe my biggest asset is patience i let everybody else talk until theyre exhausted and when i start theyre too tired to argue
youre going to need all your patience at seronia i cant imagine how youll get the two sides talking to each other
neither can i i wont know that until i get there i tend to feel my way through a situation

deck nine if i were empathic like you id have a real advantage
i thought lumerians were empathic
only with each other not other species so i dont have any idea what you might be feeling just now
curiosity what i sense from you is very unusual calmness serenity tranquillity you seem to embody the very qualities that you hope to draw out in others

tell me counsellor have you ever been involved in diplomatic negotiations
several times with captain picard there have been instances when having an empath along has been helpful
im sure i could use some of that help would you come with me when we reach seronia
if the captain authorises it of course i will
good i hope to see you again

youre late
mother i told you that id be gone for over an hour
youre late because of her have you mated with him yet
what
thats what you want isnt it
mother please come in
i can always tell the ones with a certain look in their eye
id better go
and ill tell you this if you do youll regret it the rest of your life
mother come in please you should lie down

come in
hi its that time again the dreaded crew evaluation reports
does it have to be today
its not going to be any easier tomorrow
it might
whats wrong
ive just had a disturbing encounter with alkars mother she frightens me will the feelings i sense from her are malevolent theyre out of proportion theyre evil
i know shes been sick shes very old shes probably senile who knows we could all end up that way some day
youre right okay lets get through these evaluations and when theyre done im going to reward myself with two ice cream sundaes
first molecular biology lieutenant jeffrey fratis
worf to commander riker
go ahead
can you report to ambassador alkars quarters there is an emergency
were on our way


forty ccs inaprovaline
im sorry ambassador
she was ill i should never have brought her along she was ninety three shed lived a long life i should be grateful for that
alkar is there anything i can do
counsellor theres a funeral meditation part of our rituals as an empath youre the only person on board who could perform it with me
ill be glad to help

this meditation is one of our most sacred ceremonies hold the stone like this rohm gah sevi rohm say after me an end to grief
an end to grief
an end to pain
an end to pain
strength comes from love
strength comes from love
and courage from wisdom
and courage from wisdom

thank you


computer todays appointment calendar
oh nine hundred hours counselling session with ensign janeway ten hundred hours counselling session with
cancel them cancel everything till after lunch
acknowledged


you wanted to see me doctor
yes captain im sorry to bother you but im a little concerned i havent been able to determine the cause of death she was elderly and alkar said she had been ill but i found no evidence of any disease i did find abnormally high levels of neurotransmitter residue in her cerebral cortex
what are you suggesting
id like to do an autopsy ive already spoken to alkar and he informs me that lumerian custom forbids it could you speak with him
do you suspect that her death poses some kind of threat to the enterprise
well no
then we have no alternative but to concur with his wishes



deanna
hello
come in please
i thought you might like some company if youre not too busy
nothing that cant wait would you like something to drink
no id like you to talk to me
about
about you i dont know anything about you and id like to
theres not much to know i lead a very simple life
what kind of woman do you find attractive do you find me attractive
extremely
and when you find someone attractive what do you usually do
that depends on a lot of things
is it really so complicated
it can be
well perhaps you over think things

deanna
yes
im sorry if i led you to believe you are very beautiful but our relationship cant be like that


deck four


sir

will
we were supposed to finish the crew evaluation reports
of course come in

sir
as you were
yes sir thank you sir i was just leaving
if theres anything else i need i know where to find you
yes maam

are you bothered by his being here
of course not
good because its really none of your business
i know that i believe we were with lieutenant fratis i n molecular biology
why do i think youre upset
i dont know could we just continue with the evaluation
will remember who youre talking to you are bothered i can tell
deanna im sorry i intruded when youre ready to work why dont you give me a call
i will
captains log stardate  we have arrived without incident at rekagseronia where two members of ambassador alkars delegation have been waiting they have joined us to report on the situation in the capital city

 things have deteriorated steadily rekag sympathisers in outlying districts have attacked several towns
but i was under the impression there was a cease fire agreement
it was broken before it went into effect a rekag shuttle strayed into seronian space and was destroyed by fighter craft
 naturally the rekags retaliated theres been fighting ever since
if they would just sit down with me
the rekags wont go into seronian territory for talks and the seronians wont go to rekag in the meantime they fight
ambassador the situation sounds so volatile perhaps a cooling off period
these people need an end to the fighting now to delay a week even a few days could cost thousands of lives
then i would recommend that we ask both sides if they would agree to meet in the city of darthen
why darthen
its a coastal city that has been neutral throughout the conflict both seronians and rekag loyalists live there it might be acceptable as a compromise
contact the leaders if theyll meet me in darthen i will join them there tomorrow

 i know it must be my imagination but it seems as though lieutenant pinder just doesnt want me in his section
what makes you think that
hes so critical i cant ever do anything to please him and i try counsellor i try to make sure theres nothing he could find fault with
give me an example of what you mean
well yesterday i was running routine diagnostics on the sensor pallets they checked out but lieutenant pinder questioned me because id allowed a point oh two three variance thats well within specifications he goes out of his way to criticise me
do you know of any reason why he might do that
no thats why im here
well maybe hes just tired of hearing you complain
pardon me
i know im certainly tired of it how do you think it feels to sit and listen to someone whine about themselves all the time
i didnt realise i was
this isnt starfleet academy youre not going to be coddled if you cant take it here then you might think about a transport ship theres a lot less pressure there
but i love being on the enterprise i dont want to be anywhere else
if you arent up to it then you dont deserve to be here isnt that right
i guess so
so youd better take a hold of yourself or be prepared for a transfer
i will counsellor thank you
glad i could help

yeah here we go biofilter log on sev maylor
geordi could this log have been damaged in any way
i dont think so why do you ask
theres a discrepancy between the log and the tricorder readings i took just three days later the tricorder shows massive physiological deterioration compared with her condition when she beamed aboard i find it hard to believe that so much damage could have occurred in such a short period of time
well i can run a diagnostic of the biofilter system and your tricorder
thanks of course the best way to get the information i need would be to do an autopsy

ambassador weve received word from the seronian and the rekag delegates theyve agreed to meet with you in darthen tomorrow
thank you commander

counsellor troi has altered her appearance

am i interrupting
hello counsellor
you want him i can tell but you have nothing to give him
deanna could i talk to you in private
and you youre envious of him you pretend to support him but secretly you want him to fail
thats not so
please you must return to your quarters
i wont i want to be here with you
ambassador the counsellor and i are needed on the bridge
of course commander

i dont know what you thought you were doing in there but you were way out of line

deck nine

all right deanna just what the hell is all this
imzadi do you still care about me
of course i care about you im worried about you whats all this
dont you think im attractive
this just isnt you
oh it is you want me dont you

deanna
i need you

what is this
please

come in
deanna im leaving for the surface

you said youd take me with you
i know but thats not possible now
you told me id be helpful you needed me
and i still do youve done so much for me
then take me dont leave me here is liva going with you
shes been on seronia for weeks she knows the people the situation
she wants to take you away from me
deanna you are my anchor i need you more than you can possibly realise do you understand that i need you here making it possible for me to do my work
i wont let her have you ill stop her  i will go with you take me with you please alkar dont leave me dont do this no


you wouldnt have recognised her her dress her hair everything about her im closer to deanna than ive ever been to anyone but last night she was someone that i had never seen before
and you dont know of anything that might have caused her to behave like that
no ive thought and thought about it i dont have an answer
computer location of counsellor troi
deck six corridor b
lets go

ambassador i came to alert you that the rekags and the seronians are in disagreement about the seating arrangements at the conference table
im not surprised
the good news however is that the cease fire seems to be holding
and that is by far the best news thank you captain
chief

will you take me with you
deanna
deanna ive already told you i cant
i wont let her have you

security to transporter room two
dont try and stop me no no let go

its nothing its superficial what happened to deanna
all of the systems in her body have elevated readings take her to sickbay i want to see you in sickbay too
captain perhaps we should delay transporting to the surface
no you should proceed with your mission
very well
chief transport them to the planet surface
aye sir


well have to sedate her twenty ccs of melorazine
yes doctor
hows it feeling
its a little stiff but itll be fine
itll disappear in a day or two
doctor crusher i think you should see these readings doctor her neurotransmitter levels are three hundred percent above normal
if you remember i found extremely high levels of neurotransmitter residue in alkars mother
could deanna have picked up some kind of disease from her
i dont know i need to do that autopsy i dont care about the customs of alkars people i need to find out if theres a connection between what killed maylor and whats happening to troi
picard to lieutenant worf
worf here captain
mister worf contact ambassador alkar i need to speak with him
doctor neural energy is now three hundred forty percent above normal
captain ambassador alkar is at the negotiation table and cannot be disturbed
proceed with the autopsy
medical log stardate  i have performed an autopsy on alkars mother but instead of answering our questions the results have created an even deeper mystery

i dont have any explanation for this when i examined maylors body i found her heart her lungs her skeletal structure most of the systems in her body were those of a thirty year old
but how could that be we both saw the woman
thats not all i compared maylor and alkars dna i dont know who that woman was but she was definitely not his mother deannas condition is deteriorating rapidly she could die there are questions that only alkar can answer
picard to lieutenant worf
worf here captain
meet me in transporter room two were going down to the surface
aye sir

no she wasnt my mother
and she wasnt ninety three years old
captain did you perform an autopsy against my wishes
yes for a very good reason counsellor deanna troi is in sickbay dying doctor crusher doesnt know the cause of her condition but i believe you do
alkar we need you the rekags have withdrawn some of their concessions and the seronians are threatening to break off the talks
ill be right there
but

theyve been arguing for hours in there it seems hopeless but now when expectations are lowest now is the moment i can be most effective if im focused centred free of disquieting thoughts i can turn these factions toward peace
alkar
hear me out captain its important you understand you see i discovered long ago i had the ability to channel my darker thoughts my unwanted emotions to others leaving me unencumbered
is this what youve done to counsellor troi
i hadnt planned it id expected maylor to live through the negotiation her death could not have been more untimely
so then you deliberately used deanna
shes an empath i was reasonably certain i could establish a link with her frankly i was amazed when i saw how quickly shed aged usually my receptacles survive for years
receptacles
come now captain surely you can see theres a broader canvas here if i came to these peace talks hindered by unwanted emotions the rekags and seronians would be condemned to go on fighting
you cannot explain away a wantonly immoral act because you think it is connected to some higher purpose
captain do you know how many people have died on this planet in the last forty eight hours thousands deanna troi is just one individual
that does not justify brutalising her nor any of the others you have used
ask the seronian and rekag children who go to bed each night in fear of their lives captain i get no payment i have no power base no agenda i am willing to risk my life simply to help others
do you think that makes you appear courageous because youre mistaken youre a coward alkar you exploit the innocent because youre unwilling to shoulder the burdens of unpleasant emotions well this time you will be held accountable im taking you back to the enterprise to release counsellor troi
i have no intention of releasing her now or ever
alkar everything is falling apart you have to come now
if youll excuse me captain
mister worf

im needed
you and your security chief will leave


lock on to alkars signal bring him on board
captain i am sure the seronians have reactivated their security field
then work with mister la forge to find a way to break through it i want that man on this ship
aye sir
ill be in sickbay

if alkar is flooding her with this psychic waste that would explain the high level of neurotransmitters all these negative emotions pouring into her have caused an abnormal chemical response in her brain
isnt there something you can do to counteract it
enzymic decontaminants will be able to reduce the level of the neurotransmitters but i cant make any headway unless alkar stops what hes doing
he has no intention of stopping he feels perfectly justified in using her until she dies
then deanna has to die in order to save deanna alkar has to break his link with her and the only hell do that is if shes no longer an adequate receptacle when maylor died alkar turned immediately to deanna
if deanna dies and he breaks the link with her then he will choose someone else possibly someone from his own delegation
wait a minute youre talking about killing deanna
ill be able to resuscitate her will as long as its not more than thirty minutes the big question is will that be enough time alkar has to establish a link with someone else before we revive deanna or else he might turn back to her
we must bear in mind that well be putting his next victim at risk i want every possible security measure taken to protect that person
how will you
ill give her a hypospray of dylamadon its the gentlest way
proceed doctor


well my friend an era of conflict and bloodshed appears to be over

alkar
what is it
im fine just a little lightheaded
youre exhausted
do you want a doctor
no of course not
enterprise to ambassador alkar respond sir
im here captain

ambassador you must return to the enterprise immediately counsellor troi is dying

we are prepared to transport you from the surface whether you come willingly or not
there are security force fields protecting us captain
they wont protect you any longer

transporter room two prepare to energise

were ready captain


computer make a note death occurred at fourteen thirty hours from respiratory and renal failure
will you wait for me in my quarters
of course

its a tragic loss but her death had a purpose
i intend to make certain that you answer for what you have done
your own federation council has granted me safe and timely passage back to my planet i expect you to honour that captain

how much longer do we have
three minutes and forty seconds
picard to transporter room two lock on to the young woman in ambassador alkars quarters we may have to transport her out of there
yes captain
mister worf i want you to station yourself outside her quarters
aye sir

she helped me so much without her i couldnt have accomplished what i did
im so sorry is there anything i can do
yes there is something if we could share the funeral meditation

we have a minute and a half left prepare a hypospray of cordrazine well use that in conjunction with the cortical stimulator
yes doctor

rohm gah sevi rohm rohm gah
rohm gah sevi rohm rohm gah

we cant wait any longer release the stasis field ten ccs of cordrazine
yes doctor
ten ccs cordrazine cortical stimulators now

an end  an end to pain
an end to pain

again
she has a pulse blood pressure climbing ninety over forty cortical activity approaching normal levels
lets neutralise the neurotransmitters initiate decontamination sequence
levels are dropping doctor down to four hundred and twenty percent above normal three hundred and ninety percent
picard to transporter room three
not yet we wont know if its working till the levels are below three hundred percent



alkar alkar whats wrong

neurotransmitter levels are down to three hundred and ten percent two hundred and ninety percent
now
picard to transporter room three energise


let me go



neurotransmitter levels are down to two hundred and thirty percent


worf to captain picard ambassador alkar is dead

will

beverly thinks alkar must have been at a susceptible point in the meditation ceremony he was vulnerable
then the flow of negative emotions and feelings were reversed back to him somehow
thats our guess like a man with no immune system he wasnt able to handle the overload
and liva
she seems to be fine he wasnt able to establish a link on her
looking back on the past few days its as though im looking at a holodeck projection of someone else
thats how it seemed to all of us
thanks for sticking by me
i always will even when youre old and grey
relics



captain i have identified the signal it is from the uss jenolen a federation transport ship reported missing in this sector seventy five years ago
code one alpha zero ship in distress
take us out of warp ensign all stop
 aye sir

report
we have entered a massive gravitational field captain
there are no stars or other stellar bodies listed on our navigational charts however sensors indicate the presence of an extremely strong gravitational source in this vicinity
can you localise the source of the gravitational field

sensors
i am having difficulty scanning the object it appears to be approximately two hundred million kilometres in diameter
thats nearly as large as the earths orbit around the sun
why didnt we detect this before now
the objects enormous mass is causing a great deal of gravimetric interference that might have prevented our sensors from detecting it before we dropped out of warp
mister data could this be a dyson sphere
the object does fit the general parameters of dysons theory
a dyson sphere
its a very old theory number one im not surprised that you havent heard of it in the twentieth century a physicist called freeman dyson postulated the theory that an enormous hollow sphere could be constructed around a star this would have the advantage of harnessing all the radiant energy of that star a population living on the interior surface would have virtually inexhaustible sources of power
are you saying you think there are people living in there
possibly a great number of people commander the interior surface area of a sphere this size is the equivalent of more than two hundred and fifty million class m planets
sir i have located the distress signal it is coming from a point in the northern hemisphere
ensign rager put us into synchronous orbit above that position
aye sir

i have located the jenolen sir it is impacted on the surface of the sphere
magnify
there are no life signs however there are several small power emanations and life support is still functioning on minimal levels
riker to engineering geordi join us in transporter room three mister worf

this airs pretty stale
life support is barely operating
see if you can increase the oxygen level
aye sir
commander the transporter is still online its being fed power from the auxiliary systems
the rematerialisation subroutine has been disabled
thats not all the phase inducers are connected to the emitter array the override is completely gone and the pattern buffers been locked into a continuous diagnostic cycle
this doesnt make any sense locking the unit in a diagnostic mode just sends the matter array through the pattern buffer why would anyone want to
theres a pattern in the buffer still
its completely intact theres less than point zero zero three percent signal degradation how is that possible
i dont know ive never seen a transporter juryrigged like this
could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for seventy five years
i know a way to find out

thank you lad weve got to get franklin out of there
someone elses pattern is still in the buffer
aye lad franklin we went in together somethings wrong one of the inducers has failed boost the gain on the matter stream come on franklin i know youre still in there its no use his patterns degraded fifty three percent hes gone
im sorry
so am i he was a good lad
im commander william riker starship enterprise lieutenant commander geordi la forge
the enterprise i should have known i bet jim kirk himself hauled the old girl out of mothballs to come looking for me captain montgomery scott tell me how long have i been missing
well
sir i have restored life support the oxygen levels will return to normal shortly
captain scott lieutenant worf
lieutenant
yes
captain perhaps there are a few things we should talk about

we should probably get you to sickbay doctor crusher will want to
youve changed the resonator array
geordi i think our guest is going to have a lot of engineering questions
not to worry commander ill take care of him sir

what have you done with the duotronic enhancers
those were replaced with isolinear chips about forty years ago its a lot more efficient now thats an eps power tap
ah
so you were saying earlier that you were on your way to the norpin colony when you had a warp engine failure

aye thats right we had an overload in one of the plasma transfer conduits the captain brought us out of warp and we hit some gravimetric interference and then there it was as big as life is that a conduit interface
yeah it is you were saying its big as life you mean the dyson sphere
aye an actual dyson sphere can you imagine the engineering skills needed to even design such a structure
yeah its pretty amazing so what happened when you first approached it
well we began a standard survey of the surface and we were just completing the initial orbital scan when our aft power coils suddenly exploded the ship got caught in the spheres gravity well and down we went franklin and i were the only ones to survive the crash
can i ask you a question what in the world made you think of using the transporter pattern buffer to survive
well we didnt have enough supplies to wait for a rescue so we had to think of something
yeah but locking it into a diagnostic cycle so that the pattern wouldnt degrade and then crossconnecting it phase inducers to provide a regenerative power source thats absolutely brilliant
i think it was only fifty percent brilliant franklin deserved better
i think youre going to enjoy the twenty fourth century mister scott weve made some pretty incredible advances these last eighty years
from what ive seen youve got a fine ship mister la forge a real beauty here i must admit to being a bit overwhelmed
wait until you see the holodeck

you have a hairline fracture of the humorous it will ache for a few days but it should be fine
thank you well ill say this about your enterprise the doctors are a fair sight prettier
im jeanluc picard welcome aboard the enterprise captain scott
thank you sir and call me scotty
how are you feeling
i dont know how am i feeling
other than a couple of bumps and bruises id say you feel fine for a man of a hundred and forty seven
i dont feel a day over a hundred and twenty
i must say i was little surprised when commander riker told me that you were aboard the jenolen our records didnt show you listed as a member of the crew
well i was never actually a member of the crew i was just a passenger i was heading for norpin five to settle down and enjoy my retirement
i see well i would very much enjoy the opportunity to hear you talk about your career im sure you would have some fascinating insights into the events of your time
id be happy to
good well i look forward to it excuse me commander we need to begin a full spectrographic analysis of the dyson sphere
ill get right on it sir
good once again welcome on board captain
sir
i need to get down to engineering and begin that analysis
engineering i thought youd never ask
captain the first thing you need to get is some rest now this has been a shock to your system and i want you to not push yourself
were pretty busy down there anyway captain scott i promise id be happy to give you a tour just as soon as the doctor says its okay
ill have someone show you your quarters
 aye

this is the food replicator and your computer terminal
good lord man where have you put me
these are standard guest quarters sir i can try and find something bigger if you want
bigger in my day even an admiral wouldnt have had such quarters on a starship you know i remember a time we had to transport the
dohlman of elaas
 you never heard anyone whine and complain so much about quarters as she did
the holodecks ten forward and the gymnasium are all at your disposal the computer can tell you how to find them until we issue you a combadge just use one of these panels if you need anything
you know these quarters remind me of a hotel room on
argelius
 oh now there is a planet everything a man wants right at his fingertips of course on the first visit i got into a wee bit of trouble
excuse me sir but i have to return to duty
oh well then thank you

i want you to shut down the warp engines and recalibrate the aft sensors while i work on the lateral array
aye sir
can i help you sir
oh i dont think so lassie but ill let you know if you can
sir this area is restricted to authorised personnel
bartel its okay ill handle it captain scott this really isnt
were in engineering call me scotty
scotty this really isnt a good time for a tour were running a phase seven survey of the dyson sphere
im not here for a tour laddie im here to help
thats very kind but im sure we can handle it
i was a starfleet engineer for fifty two years mister la forge i think im still useful
youre right wed be grateful for any help you can give us
good lets get to work

sensor readings indicate the presence of a gtype star at the centre of the sphere there also appears to be a classm atmosphere clinging to the interior surface
is there any indication that the sphere is inhabited
not as yet sir our preliminary data suggests it is still capable of supporting life we have been unable to find definite signs of current habitation
mister data send out a series of classfour probes to survey the far side of the sphere perhaps well have more luck with them
aye sir

adjust the frequency stabilisation on the main deflector dish its out of synch with the aft sensors
laddie you need to phaselock the warp fields within three percent or theyll become unstable
what
well look here the warp field is

we use a multiphase autocontainment field now its meant to operate above three percent
oh well that would make the difference
we can re start the engines in ten minutes commander
thank you lieutenant
i remember a time when the old enterprise was spiralling in toward
psi two thousand

thank you
the captain wanted to try a cold start of the warp engines i told him that without a proper phase lock it would take at least thirty minutes you canna change the laws of physics i told him but he wouldnt believe me so i had to come up with a new engine startup routine do you know that your dilithium crystals are going to fracture
we recomposite the crystals while theyre still inside the articulation frame look mister scott id love to explain everything to you but the captain wants this spectrographic analysis done by thirteen hundred hours
do you mind a little advice starfleet captains are like children they want everything right now and they want it their way but the secret is to give them only what they need not what they want
yeah well i told the captain id have this analysis done in an hour
how long will it really take
an hour
you didnt tell him how long it would really take did you
of course i did
oh laddie youve got a lot to learn if you want people to think of you as a miracle worker now listen
captain scott ive tried to be patient ive tried to be polite but ive got a job to do here and quite frankly youre in the way
i was driving starships while your greatgrandfather was still in diapers id think youd be a little grateful for a some help ill leave ye to work mister la forge

may i help you sir
aye lad scotch neat
there you go sir
thank you

what in blazes is this
didnt you order scotch
laddie i was drinking scotch a hundred years before you were born and i can tell you that whatever this is it is definitely not scotch
i believe i may be of some assistance captain scott is unaware of the existence of synthehol
synthehol
yes sir it is an alcohol substitute now being served aboard starships it simulates the appearance taste and smell of alcohol but the intoxicating affects can be easily dismissed
youre not quite human are you
no sir i am an android lieutenant commander data
synthetic scotch synthetic commanders
i believe guinan does keep a limited supply of nonsyntheholic products perhaps one of them would be to your liking

what is it
it is  it is 
it is green


ah


please enter programme
the android at the bar said you could show me my old ship let me see it
insufficient data please specify parameters
the enterprise show me the bridge of the enterprise you chattering piece of
there have been five federation ships with that name please specify by registry number
ncc one seven oh one no bloody a b c or d
programme complete enter when ready


heres to you lads
i hope im not interrupting i was just coming off duty and i wanted to see how you were doing
not at all not at all have a drink with me captain
thank you
i dont know what it is exactly but i would be real careful its real

aldebaran whiskey who do you think gave it to guinan
ah
constitution class
aye youre familiar with them
theres one in the fleet museum but then of course this is your enterprise
i actually served on two this was the first she was also the first ship i ever served on as chief engineer you know i served aboard eleven ships freighters cruisers starships but this is the only one i think of the only one i miss
the first ship i ever served aboard as captain was called the stargazer it was an overworked underpowered vessel always on the verge of flying apart at the seams in every measurable sense my enterprise is far superior but there are times when i would give almost anything to command the stargazer again
its like the first time you fall in love you dont ever love a woman quite like that again well to the enterprise and the stargazer old girlfriends well never meet again
what do you think of the enterprise d
shes a beauty with a good crew
but
but when i was here i could tell you the speed that we were traveling by the feel of the deckplates but on your ship i feel like im just in the way
seventy five years is a long time if you would care to study some technical schematics or
im not eighteen i cant start out like a raw cadet no there comes a time when a man finds that he cant fall in love again he knows that its time to stop i dont belong on your ship i belong on this one this was my home this is where i had a purpose but its not real its just a computer generated fantasy and im just an old man whos trying to hide in it computer shut this bloody thing off its time i acted my age

come

mister la forge i understand that before the jenolen crashed it had conducted an extensive survey of the dyson sphere have we been able to access any of those records
we did try to download their memory core but it was pretty heavily damaged in the crash we actually havent been able to get much out of it
perhaps captain scott could be of use in accessing that material
its possible he does know those systems better than any of us ill have lieutenant bartel beam down with him
mister la forge i would like you to accompany captain scott
me sir
yes look this is not an order its a request and its one which you must feel perfectly free to decline you see one of the most important things in a persons life is to feel useful now mister scott is a starfleet officer and i would like him to feel useful again
ill go with him sir
thank you

commander i believe i have found something on the sphere which could be a communications device theres an antenna array approximately four hundred thousand kilometres south of our present position it is emitting low intensity subspace signals
can you open a channel
no sir not from our present orbit the array is currently directed away from us
ensign prepare to put us in orbit above those coordinates captain picard to the bridge please

are you feeling all right
never get drunk unless youre willing to pay for it the next day ill manage
okay energise

sensors indicate that the large circle is a portal or airlock possibly leading to the interior of the sphere
this looks like the front door should we ring the bell
mister worf open a channel to that communications array
aye sir

some type of tractor beam has locked onto us
helm get us out of here
weve lost main power auxiliary power down to twenty percent

were being pulled inside
auxiliary power failing
the resonance frequency of the tractor beams is incompatible with our power systems warp and impulse engine relays have been overloaded i am attempting to compensate

the tractor beams have released us sir
hold position here until we can get our bearings
full sensor sweep mister data where are we
approximately ninety million kilometres from the stars photosphere i am reading a great deal of surface instability it may be
sir the inertial motion from the tractor beams is still carrying us forward impulse engines are offline and i cant stop our momentum were falling directly into the star

the primary computer database should be online now give it a try
okay ive got three access lines to the central core still nothing
bunch of old useless garbage
huh
i say its old mister la forge it cant handle the interface of your power converter this equipment was designed for a different era now its just a piece of junk
i dont know it seems like some of its held together pretty well
a century out of date its just obsolete
well you know thats interesting because i was just thinking that a lot of these systems havent changed much in the last seventy five years this transporter is basically the same system we use on the enterprise subspace radio and sensors still operate under the same basic principle impulse engine design hasnt changed much in the last two hundred years if it wasnt for all the structural damage this ship might still be in service today
maybe so but when they can build ships like your enterprise whod want to pilot an old bucket like this
i dont know if this ship were operational i bet shed run circles around the enterprise at impulse speeds just because somethings old doesnt mean you throw it away
we used to have something called a dynamic mode converter you wouldnt have something like that on your enterprise would you
i havent seen anything like that in a long time but i bet i might be able to come up with something similar la forge to enterprise la forge to enterprise come in please
interference
no theyre gone

we will enter the suns photosphere in three minutes
manoeuvring thrusters
ive got thirty percent power it wont be enough to stop us
no but it may be enough to turn us into orbit hold our distance from the photosphere ensign port thrusters ahead full starboard thrusters back full
our flight path is changing right ten point seven degrees sir insufficient to clear the photosphere
lieutenant bartel divert all power from auxiliary relay systems to the manoeuvring thrusters
aye sir
were in orbit captain our altitude is one hundred fifty thousand kilometres
ill see about getting main power back online
very well mister data begin a scan of the interior surface for life forms i want to know who brought us in here and why
aye sir

i cant find them anywhere in orbit
they couldve crashed into the sphere like the jenolen
no wed be picking up background radiation if theyd gone down
theres another possibility they could be inside the sphere
maybe whatever happened weve got to find them if we can get these engines back online we could track them with their impulse ion trail
are ye daft the main drive assemblys shot the inducers are melted and the power couplings are wrecked wed need a week just to get started but we dont have a week so theres no sense in crying about it come on well see what we can do with your power converter

the sphere appears to be abandoned sensors show that the star is extremely unstable it is experiencing severe bursts of radiation and matter expulsions
then that would explain why they abandoned it but if theres no one still living there how were we brought inside
i believe we triggered a series of automatic piloting beams designed to guide ships into the sphere
sir sensors show a large magnetic disturbance on the stars surface
it is a solar flare captain magnitude twelve class b
shields
shields are up but only at twenty three percent
the star has entered a period of increased activity sensors indicate that the solar flares will continue to grow in three hours our shields will no longer be sufficient to protect us sir

shunt the deuterium from the main cryopump to the auxiliary tank
the tank cant withstand that kind of pressure
whered you get that idea
what do you mean where did i get that idea its in the impulse engine specifications
regulation forty two slash fifteen pressure variances on irc tank storage
yeah
forget it i wrote it a good engineer is always a wee bit conservative at least on paper just bypass the secondary cutoff valve and boost the flow itll work
okay
if weve done our jobs properly the engines should be coming back online about now
hey you were right the auxiliary tank is holding
take the bridge commander
oh no youre the senior officer here
i may be captain by rank but i never wanted to be anything else but an engineer
all right


shields still holding sir but they are down another fifteen percent
mister worf can we use the phasers to open a hole in the sphere
no sir the exterior shell is composed of carbon neutronium our weapons would be ineffective
mister data we have to find some way out of here begin scanning for another hatch or portal that might still be open
the interior surface area is over ten to the sixteenth square kilometres it will take seven hours to completely scan the surface

i will endeavour to speed up the process sir


the enterprise ion trail leads right to this point
it looks like some kind of doorway
ill bet you two bottles of scotch that theyre inside the sphere and that they went in right through that hatch
no bet here the question is how
look at the momentum distribution of the ions it would take an impulse engine at full reverse to put out a signature like that
so they didnt go in willingly this looks like some kind of communications array
aye we found hundreds of them when we did our initial survey seventy five years ago
did you try hailing them
aye that was standard procedure at the time we did it right before we crashed
hailing is standard procedure today too scotty what if those arent communications arrays what if theyre access terminals which are triggered by subspace signals on certain frequencies
frequencies like our standard ships hail
exactly the enterprise when they saw that terminal they probably did the same thing you did seventy five years ago opened a channel only this time they triggered something that activated that hatch and pulled the ship inside the sphere
very nice piece of reasoning laddie nice indeed
yeah we could probably trigger the hatch ourselves only wed get pulled in like they were
maybe all we need to do is to get our foot in the door we might not be pulled inside when the hatch opens if we keep our distance from the sphere say half million kilometres then when the hatch starts to close we move in and we use the jenolen to jam the hatch open hoping that the enterprise will escape
you cant be serious that hatch is huge itll crush this ship like an egg
geordi the shields will hold dont worry about that i can get a few extra gigawatts out of these babies
scotty its crazy
geordi i have spent my whole life trying to figure out crazy ways of doing things im telling you as one engineer to another i can do this
all right lets do it 
were at five hundred thousand kilometres
engines are ready
okay here we go

come on theres nothing out here give it up

thats it lets go full impulse


sir there is an audio message from commander la forge
la forge to enterprise do you read me
go ahead commander we read you

were using the jenolen to hold open the hatch that you came through but our shields arent going to hold out much longer

understood ensign set a course

the plasma intercoolers gone the engines are overheating
ive lost helm control la forge to enterprise captain were not going to be able to move this ship out of the way when you get here

youre going to have to destroy it in order to escape
how much longer before we reach them
with impulse engines operating at sixty percent power it will take one minute and forty seconds
bridge to transporter room three prepare to beam two from the jenolen as soon as were within range

its coming apart lad i cant do anything else

photon torpedoes armed and ready sir
we are within transporter range
bridge to transporter room energise
aye sir
fire torpedoes


there now that wasnt so bad was it
captains log stardate  starfleet has dispatched two science vessels to study the dyson sphere while we proceed to starbase fifty five

so this
alien space baby
 which was about the size of a four story building really thought the enterprise was its mother
youre pulling an old mans leg
no really it was suckling power directly from the ships fusion reactors so doctor brahms and i changed the power frequency from twenty one centimetres to point oh two centimetres
you soured the milk
thats right
enjoy these times geordi youre the chief engineer of a starship and its a time of your life thatll never come again when its gone its gone now lad i thought you were going to buy me a drink in ten forward
actually i had a better idea


youre giving me one of your shuttles
well call it an extended loan since you lost your ship saving ours it seemed only fair
shes not much to look at
laddie every woman has her own charm you just have to know where to look for it
shes a little slow but shell certainly get you to the norpin colony if thats really where you want to go
the norpin colony is for old men to retire maybe someday ill end up there but not yet
well bon voyage mister scott
thank you sir for everything

mister scott
goodbye
bye bye 
scotty
thank you
 bye be well

a good crew
yeah they are
a fine ship a credit to her name but ive always found that a ship is only as good as the engineer who takes care of her and from what i can see the enterprise is in good hands
you take care of yourself out there
aye
schisms

captains log stardate  the enterprise has entered the amargosa diaspora an unusually dense globular cluster we are faced with the daunting task of charting this vast region



lieutenant shipley lets get a triangulation on these sector points
aye sir
sorry im late i overslept again what have we got
well the clusters a lot more dense than we thought its going to take three days just to map out one tenth of it
three days
i think weve found a way to speed that up a bit weve been testing a way of channelling warp energy directly to the main deflector grid it should enhance the long range sensors
the modification would increase our sensor efficiency and imaging resolution by twenty five percent or more
that sounds like thatll use up a lot of warp energy
wed channel it through the eps mains on deck four near cargo bay four
okay lets give it a try
data lets get those field taps online
commander i would like to remind you about my poetry reading this afternoon
i wouldnt miss it for the world
i cant wait to see what hes come up with


then we sat on the sand for some time and observed
how the oceans that cover the world were perturbed
by the tides from the orbiting moon overhead
how relaxing the sound of the waves is you said
i began to expound upon tidal effects
when you asked me to stop looking somewhat perplexed
so i did not explain why the sunset turns red
and we watched the occurrence in silence instead

that poem was written in anapaestic tetrameter for my ninth poem
i dont understand i can barely keep my eyes open
throughout the ages from keats to jorkemo poets have composed odes to individuals who have had a profound effect on their lives in keeping with that tradition i have written my next poem in honour of my cat i call it ode to spot
felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature
an endothermic quadruped carnivorous by nature
your visual olfactory and auditory senses
contribute to your hunting skill and natural defences
i find myself intrigued by your subvocal oscillations
a singular development of cat communications
that obviates your basic hedonistic predilection
for a rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate affection
a tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents
you would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance
and when not being utilised to aid in locomotion
it often serves to illustrate the state of your emotions

commander you have anticipated my denouement however the sentiment is appreciated i will continue
oh spot the complex levels of behaviour you display
connote a fairly well developed cognitive array
and though you are not sentient spot and do not comprehend
i nonetheless consider you a true and valued friend

i have no problem getting to sleep then i think im sleeping all night when i wake up i feel exhausted
how long has this been going on
two three days do you have to hold that thing that close im sorry ive been on edge all day
well other than some muscle tension in your neck i dont see anything physically wrong with you have you been having bad dreams
not that i can remember
this could be the result of lack of rem sleep
what do you recommend

drink this before going to bed
what is it
a recipe for a warm milk toddy
a hot milk toddy youre kidding
the heat activates amino acids in the lactose making it a natural sedative besides this is a recipe of the captains aunt adelle its delicious
well at this point ill try anything
and listen if it still bothers you tomorrow come and see me and ill run further tests
thanks

everythings in place warp grid couplers subspace field taps all right lets do it lieutenant shipley initiate warp power transfer
aye sir verifying sensor calibration eps mains holding stable sensor array online
come on work
geordi active scanner output has increased by twenty six percent
inform astrophysics that the new la forge sensor array is online and awaiting major scientific discoveries
yes sir
geordi may i make a personal inquiry it concerns my poetry reading
sure data what is it
i noticed that many spectators seemed distracted during my presentation was my poetry uninteresting
well it was very well constructed a virtual tribute to form
thank you and
and what
did it evoke an emotional response
well
your hesitation suggests you are trying to protect my feelings however since i have none i would prefer you to be honest an artists growth depends upon accurate feedback
well your poems were clever data and your haiku was clever and your sonnet was clever but did it evoke an emotional response to be honest no i dont think so
then i did not succeed in my efforts
no its not that you didnt succeed you accomplished a lot but if you want to touch people dont concentrate so much on rhyme and metre think more about what you want to say instead of how youre saying it

thats the power grid warning
i am reading a massive eps explosion
where
i am attempting to localise it it is cargo bay four
ive got three people in there damage control medical team to cargo bay four lets go


the field imbalance has subsided
there may still be a residual discharge stand clear

is there something wrong sir

and theres no evidence of an eps explosion
sensors seemed to think there was
i think my modification to the sensor array may have caused a pattern recognition failure
just a sensor glitch
thats my guess
lets perform a level three diagnostic on the internal sensor network and make sure that we havent overlooked anything
aye sir
could we pick this up in the morning geordi get a fresh start would you do me a favour stop by my quarters oh seven hundred hours im having trouble waking up
sure commander goodnight
goodnight



commander
gordon


who is it
its la forge
come in
good morning
morning i just went to bed
commander its oh seven hundred hours

she said if theyre not squirming we wont eat em

ah mister worf my good klingon sir welcome what a pleasure it is to have you with us again so soon so lieutenant haircut today trim your beard
i would like my hair trimmed
ah a trim of course
not like last time
oh no just a little off the top i took way too much off last time i was just telling my colleague mister setti how thick and luxuriant klingon hair is its such a pleasure to cut sometimes i get carried away all those away missions the wind and dry air the elements really are harsh on the hair id like to suggest that you start using a conditioning agent

i promise not too much off the top



just before the grid alarm sounded we were running warp power through this junction somehow it mustve tripped the internal scanners
and it showed up as an eps explosion
yes but the question is why ive made modifications to the sensors before but nothing like this has ever happened

we cant waste time chasing down sensor ghosts we should probably keep the whole array offline until we can get take a closer look
 excuse me
i know the feeling the past few nights it seems like as soon as my head hits the pillow its time to get up in the morning
im sure we could all use a little shore leave after this surveys completed
definitely keep me posted
yeah data im wondering if you could give me a hand i need to run a structural integrity scan i want to make sure that none of the conduit was

what is it
this is the second time today that my visors just cut out like that
are you all right geordi
i dont know i just had a very weird feeling maybe i should go to sickbay
i will run the integrity scan
thanks data

this is curious theres a slight bacterial infection around your neural inputs it was probably interrupting the data stream
an infection from what
it doesnt match any bacterial strains on record im going to have to sterilise the area but i need to run a resonance tissue scan to search for any signs of additional infection come over here sit down now come forward now youre going to need to hold very still

hows the scan going data
i have just started the scan did you not go to sickbay
data ive been there for over an hour and a half
that is not possible my internal chronometer indicates you have been gone for exactly one minute fifteen seconds
im telling you data ive been gone for over an hour
computer what is the time please
the time is fourteen twenty seven hours
you are correct ninety two minutes seventeen seconds have passed since you left the room
what have you been doing all this time
i have no memory of events during that period when we are finished here i will perform a selfdiagnostic
you know first we picked up a false eps explosion then my visor cuts out twice and now you lose an hour all in the cargo bay la forge to engineering i want a diagnostic team to cargo bay four immediately
on our way sir

ensign rager cartography needs a better position to study cluster fgc thirteen bring us about heading one twenty three mark four
aye sir helm wont lock to those coordinates sir
first time navigating through a globular cluster ensign you have got to compensate for gravimetric interference before

is there something wrong sir
no i dont know put us back on our original heading ensign


dont tell me this cant be right data come here and take a look at this would you i think we have another sensor glitch
sensors are functioning normally they are detecting a subspace particle emission originating from within this room
from within this room thats impossible
the emission is emanating from this direction geordi


the structure of the bulkhead has been altered on a subatomic level the metal itself is in a state of quasimolecular flux
whats causing it
this is where it gets a little wild captain behind that panel is a junction we were using to transfer warp power to the sensor array were reading a subspace particle stream emanating from that junction
it appears to be composed of spatially inverted tetryon particles we believe they are emanating from a tertiary subspace manifold
but i thought that tetryons were unstable in normal space
we dont understand it either sir something from that deep in subspace shouldnt be able to exist in our universe but there it is
does it pose a danger to the ship
not unless it spreads if it does we can beam the bulkhead into space and erect a forcefield in its place
well keep that option ready in the meantime proceed with the analysis
aye sir

when i sat down at the console it triggered a response like i had been trapped i had to get out of there
was it something about the console itself
no i felt like i was disconnected like it was something i had dreamed
youre the third person today whos come to me with something like this an intense emotional response provoked by an object
did any of them know why theyd the response
no they couldnt explain it any more than you could you know at this point im not willing to say its coincidence
maybe we should all get together
talking about it would help you understand your response im going to find out if anyone else on the ship has had these kind of experiences

will you told me you had an unusual experience when you sat down at the console why dont you describe it
it was vague the way you recall a dream i remember the sensation of feeling trapped and something about a smooth surface
i had a similar response but to a pair of scissors
have you dreamt about scissors recently
i may have i do not have a distinct memory of it
when my visor cut out in the cargo bay i had a weird feeling too it was something about a smooth surface it was smooth and cold yeah it was cold
 yes cold
it was elevated a platform
right like a bench or a table
it seems youve all had a similar experience is there anything else you remember besides a table
maybe theres a way we can all help ourselves to remember more

well you all remember a table so lets start with that computer show me a table
there are five thousand forty seven classifications of tables on file specify design parameters
can you be more specific about the table you mentioned it was smooth and cold can you remember what shape it was
long it was long
yeah and it had a rectangular shape
computer show me a rectangular conference table
its too high computer reduce the height of the table by twenty five percent
no the table was smaller and it was inclined computer decrease the tables surface area by twenty percent and incline the top fifteen degrees
no it wasnt made of wood it was smoother more metallic
computer make this a metal table

yeah thats starting to look right
was there anything else in the room furniture chairs a door other people
no it was dark
yes it was dark i couldnt see beyond the table
computer lower the surrounding light level
there was a light right in my face a bright light computer give me a bright light right above the table
specify light source
i couldnt tell it was above me an overhead lamp
estimated distance of light source
i dont know it was at least two or three metres above brighter brighter
you said you were uneasy when you sat down at the conn position
yes i felt trapped by the console but it wasnt like this there was something else here
a restraint of some kind
yes there was a restraint it was flat and metal it was made of metal it came down over my legs no no it was across my chest right here
it was holding you down
yes it was part of the table it was here it was right here
computer create a restraining arm attached to the right side of the table at the midpoint
was it like that
computer put controls on the restraining arm a control panel lights
there was something else there over the head of the table a metal swing arm computer create a metal swing arm double jointed total length one metre connect it to the head of the table
there was something attached to it a tool of some sort scissorlike computer produce a pair of scissors attached to the armature the handle is wrong it was not scissors computer make the handle a single grip ten centimetres long solid metal now make one blade longer curved inward and give the other blade a jagged edge
all right you were lying on the table you had a bright light shining in your eyes were there any smells in the room were there any sounds
yes yes there was a sound computer there were noises coming from the darkness strange like whispering
more like clicks clicking sounds
louder faster more of them
ive been in this room before
weve all been here before


here it is again something has caused high levels of serotonin to be produced in geordis visual cortex when i examined him earlier today i thought it was the result of a bacterial infection but now im finding the same thing in all three they all have elevated levels of serotonin its concentrated in the hippocampus which suggests that theyve been exposed to a neurosedative and thats not all i have detected minute tetryon particle traces in their subdermal tissues
tetryons like the emissions in the cargo bay

i have completed my self diagnostic and have confirmed that i was not aboard the enterprise for ninety minutes seventeen seconds yesterday afternoon
are you sure
whenever i am on the ship the warp field leaves an electromagnetic signal on my internal servofluid system between the period of twelve fifty four and fourteen twenty six hours that signature is missing
computer are there any members of the crew of the enterprise missing
there are two crewmembers unaccounted for
identify them
lieutenant edward hagler and ensign sariel rager
when did they leave
they have not been present since twenty three thirty two hours
how did they leave
method of departure unknown
picard to bridge
bridge here captain
raise shields and i want a level four security alert i need to know if anyone comes on or off this ship
aye sir
mister la forge mister data i believe that if we find the source of those tetryon emissions well find the missing crewmembers
were on it sir

doctor crusher youd better take a look at this
my god
what is it
it looks as though your arm has been severed and then reattached
what
the skeletal structure in your radius and ulna is offset by point zero two microns your arm has been amputated then surgically reattached


any progress with the analysis lieutenant
take a look at this

data the tetryon emissions have intensified they seem to be focusing in this direction coalescing here theyre reading as a point of subspace energy
it appears to be the beginnings of a spatial rupture
the tetryon emissions are modulating in a way that looks like somebodys controlling the energy you know the signals from the modifications i made to the sensor array some of them dig pretty deep into subspace maybe they caught somebodys attention
at the rate the rupture is expanding we will soon be in danger of hull breach
maybe we should try surrounding it with a subspace containment field

other than the tetryon emissions in cargo bay four our internal sensors havent recorded anything unusual in the past three days
initiate a metallurgical analysis of the ships hull subspace field incursions may have left a trace
captain sensors indicate that lieutenant hagler has returned to the enterprise he is in his quarters deck seven section nineteen


computer emergency entry chief medical officer beverly crusher

crusher to sickbay get a plasma infusion unit to deck seven section nineteen

his blood is turning into a liquid polymer

weve set up a containment field in cargo bay four but the rupture just keeps expanding id say weve got another five or six hours before it breaches the hull
can we still beam the affected sections out into space
no sir the spatial rupture is creating severe nucleonic interference it is impossible to obtain a positive lock on the bulkheads
has your analysis suggested any way in which we might seal this rupture
we think we can close the rupture by neutralising the tetryon emissions with a coherent graviton pulse but wed have to do that at the source
how do we find the source
good question the emissions are coming from a tertiary subspace domain but subspace has an infinite number of domains its like a huge honeycomb with an endless number of cells we need to isolate the exact cell that these emissions are coming from
if someone homed onto the subspace signals created by our modified signal array could we do the same to them track the tetryon emissions to their universe
tetryon particles have a random momentum our sensors cannot track them sir
perhaps we could construct a homing device something that our sensors could track
thats a good idea but theres no way to get that device to the source
yes there is give it to me theyve taken me for the last few nights if im right the same thingll happen tonight
if you had a homing device we could track it to your location in subspace and as soon as they send you back to the ship we could transmit the graviton pulse and neutralise the tetryon emissions
if they send him back ensign rager still hasnt been returned
theyre going to take me whether i want to go or not
well we could wait as long as possible for you to be returned number one but when the spatial ruptures begin to threaten the ship then we would have to transmit that graviton pulse
understood
perhaps theres a way that we could give you an advantage a way of keeping you conscious after they have taken you doctor can you develop some counteragent to the neurosedative that they have been giving the crew
i could give you a neurostimulant but the dosage would have to be rather high to counteract the effects it could be risky
im willing to take that risk
make it so mister la forge begin work on that homing device

this should be enough to ward off their neurosedative for about twelve hours
i hope its enough
its going to have to be i cant risk giving you a higher dosage
ive locked this tricorder into a continuous cycle that way itll keep recording whether you open it or not hopefully you can bring back some information about their domain weve modified a sensor relay emitter to transmit a subspace beacon when this indicator lights up it means that weve locked onto your location

understood



captain commander riker has been taken from the enterprise



mister la forge report
i still cant locate the homing signal weve covered the entire upper subspace energy band were extending the scan to adjacent levels
mister data your status
the rupture has expanded another four point two percent

without further reinforcement containment field integrity will fail in approximately fourteen minutes

can you divert more power to the containment field
i can try to augment the field with auxiliary power but it wont be much
make it so
aye sir



captain ive located the homing signal locking onto it now its coming from a subspace energy level of sixteen point two kev
stand by to initiate the graviton pulse
graviton emitters at full power sir standing by
mister data how much time

at the present rate containment failure will occur in approximately nine minutes



captain the containment field is beginning to fluctuate failure anticipated in

three minutes eleven seconds
we cant afford to wait any longer begin the graviton pulse
initiating pulse now



data to engineering the graviton pulse is having an effect tetryon emissions have decreased by nineteen percent

captain additional subharmonics have appeared they are reinforcing the tetryon emissions they appear to be counteracting the graviton pulse

the rupture is beginning to expand again sir
looks like somebody is fighting back
can you strengthen the graviton pulse
i can try to set up a random frequency shift if we can keep them from guessing our pulse modulation they might not be able to compensate



tetryon emissions continue to increase the rupture is still expanding

hull breach is imminent
theyre reacting faster than we can shift frequencies shipley programme the emitters for full spectrum pulse compression i want to channel all of the graviton energy into a single burst lets see if they can handle that
ready commander



the rupture is beginning to close sir

recharge the emitters lets hit them again come on
ready



the rupture is eighty six percent closed
were almost there one more burst should do it
emitters recharging




captains log stardate  the tetryon emissions in cargo bay four have ceased and there have been no further indications of alien intrusions all enterprise crewmembers are safe and accounted for but we are still left with some unanswered questions

based on the information gathered by commander rikers tricorder we have determined that the molecular structure of the alien life forms is solanogenbased
we think thats why they couldnt come through into our space as easily as they could take us into theirs they needed to learn how to remodulate their cellular energy states in order to survive in our universe
the tricorder readings indicate they created a small pocket of our universe in their laboratory to keep those they abducted alive
like putting a fish in a bucket of water
thats probably what they were trying to do in cargo bay four create a pocket of their universe in ours
what can we do to prevent this from happening again
it looks like they found us initially by discovering my modified sensor signal we should warn all starfleet ships not to make that same mistake
have we any idea what came through the rupture before we were able to shut it down
no sir we were unable to track it once it left the cargo bay
maybe it was a probe of some kind
possibly they were simply curious explorers like ourselves
ensign rager and i were lucky to have escaped lieutenant haglers dead whoever it was sent that thing was more than simply curious
true q

captains log stardate  we have arrived at starbase one one two and are loading relief supplies destined for tagra four an ecologically devastated planet in the argolis cluster we have also taken on a rather unusual passenger

welcome to the enterprise miss rogers im delighted to have you aboard
 thank you sir
and congratulations i understand that you were selected for this internship out of hundreds of applicants
yes sir i still cant believe they chose me there were lots of other people with better records
your transcript is very impressive shes done honours work in neurobiology plasma dynamics and ecoregeneration id say thats pretty well rounded
thats a nice way of saying that i havent decided what im going to do with my life
ive arranged to have you work in all the major departments while youre here and im willing to bet that by the time its over youll have a pretty good idea what field youre interested in
or at least what fields youre not interested in

come
were bringing up the rest of the cargo now we should be ready to leave within the hour
commander will you escort miss rogers to her quarters i need to discuss the tagrans medical needs with doctor crusher and miss rogers
yes
youve won yourself a rare opportunity avail yourself of it
i will sir and thank you

itll take a few days before you know where everything is if you need any help you just use one of these comm panels
were on deck seven section four
youre right
i practically memorised the specs on the way over here
youre a quick study this is it

is this for me
its all yours
its so big
for honour students only the best
well i couldve brought my zoo
your zoo
thats just what my parents call it three dogs isnt that many is it
it depends how they get along
i could have a dozen mother said enough is enough im sure going to miss em
well keep you so busy you wont have a chance to ive got to get going i have to get back to cargo bay two
well thanks for walking me down
sure

oh no oh no no no no i didnt mean it

you guys cant stay here  come on all of you

hello come here little one you too come on come on



see all these readouts thats your heart rate your blood pressure all your vital signs youre in good shape you might just live to be my age
now all these tricorders need to be tested before they get put in the supply containers that were taking to tagra
so i should scan myself with each one to make sure all the readouts are working
any unit that doesnt put it aside and well do a diagnostic on it later
okay
i hear youve been accepted to the academy i have a son there
oh being posted on the enterprise i guess you dont get to see him very often
no not as often as id like
do you have any other children
my husband died a number of years ago wes was our only child
was he old enough to know his father
jack died when he was five
my parents died when i was a baby too i dont remember anything about them sometimes i wonder what they were like
your adoptive parents are in starfleet arent they
yeah theyre marine biologists theyve just been posted to the bilaren system
sickbay to doctor crusher you wanted to be told when the cultures were ready
on my way when youve finished with the tricorders nurse ogawa can help you take them down to shuttlebay for loading
okay


oh thank you very much for your help we can use every available hand we can get this is one of the largest relief efforts weve ever mounted
now why are you bringing everything down in shuttlecraft
well because we cant use the transporters for all of the ionisation in the tagran atmosphere
from the barystatic filters
how did you know that
i did a paper on ecoregeneration
well then you know that a thousand barystatic filters puts out quite a bit of ionisation
a thousand
yeah theyve managed to pollute their atmosphere pretty badly
its amazing to think that they go to such lengths to clean the air instead of regulating the emissions that cause the problem
youre right actually the only thing the filters can do is keep things from getting worse

they shoot the air full of

commander are you all right you okay
i didnt even see it coming

this is the main control area we can access any of the primary circuits from all of these panels over here is a jeffries tube
where most of the major conduits are routed
youve been doing your homework
its hard to imagine how much energy is being harnessed in there
imagination is not necessary the scale is readily quantifiable we are presently generating twelve point seven five billion gigawatts per

temperature in the reaction chamber has increased by forty seven percent
injector couplings are frozen i cant slow down the reaction
temperature increase is at one hundred six percent and rising
la forge to bridge were looking at a core breach were going to have to try and vent the plasma
plasma inductors are not responding
were going to lose containment all right everybody out of here now lets go lets move it data bring down the isolation door were going to have to eject the warp core

temperature in the reaction chamber has returned to normal

shes a little shaken up but shes going to be
you said she was adopted could she be an alien
shes human theres nothing more unusual about her not that my instruments can detect
commander have you been able to determine the cause of the warp breach
no sir everything was normal and then suddenly its like the laws of physics went right out the window
and why shouldnt they theyre so inconvenient
q
mon capitane
are you responsible for the incident in engineering
of course i needed to find out if what i suspected about the girl were true
that being
that shes q
amandas a q
how is that possible her parents her biological parents were human
well not exactly they had assumed human form in order to visit earth i suppose for amusement but in vulgar human fashion they proceeded to conceive a child and then like mawkish humans they became attached to it what is it about those squirming little infants that you find so appealing
im sure thats beyond your comprehension q
i desperately hope so
what happened to amandas parents
they died in an accident none of us knew whether she had inherited the capacities of the q but recently theyve began to emerge and as an expert in humanity i was sent to investigate
you an expert in humanity
not a very challenging field of study i grant you
are you saying that you created a core breach just to test this girl
what would have happened if she couldnt stop it
then i wouldve known she wasnt a q
and now that you know what do you intend to do
instruct here if that child does not learn how to control her power she may accidently destroy herself or all of you or perhaps your entire galaxy
i find it hard to believe that youre here to do us a favour
youre quite right i wouldnt but there are those in the continuum who have an overexaggerated sense of responsibility they think that we need to take precautions to keep the little dear from running amuck
and once youve taught her then youll go away
and leave her here of course not shell come back to the continuum where she belongs
wait a minute you cant just come in here and take her away from everything shes ever known
i assure you i can
she has plans for herself she wants to have a career and a family
im rescuing her from that miserable existence
that miserable existence is all shes known for the last eighteen years you have no right to take it away from her
mon capitane i really think that we need to speak privately


well there thats better crusher gets more shrill with each passing year
q what is it you really want
well since you know so much about the q i thought youd the perfect person to introduce me to the child let her know she can trust me
i dont trust you q why should i expect amanda to
well shed better because im all shes got she needs me to help her prepare for her future with the q
but what if she doesnt want that future it must be her decision
oh yes yes yes do you think shell want to remain an enfeebled mortal
but if she really is q she must understand what that means very well i will introduce you but we cannot argue like this in front of her we must at least appear to be
pals
civil
i knew i could count on you jeanluc

mister data i want you to access any available records on amanda rogers
yes captain
i want to know about her biological parents about their death i find it odd that any q could die in an accident
it is not consistent with what we know of them sir
im convinced that q isnt telling us everything see what you can find out
aye sir

it started happening about six months ago things that i would wish for would just suddenly appear i thought i was going crazy in a funny way finding this out is kind of a relief
i can understand that this person i mentioned from the q continuum would like to meet you if its all right with you
im ready
good

theres my girl

amanda allow me to introduce er q hes er hes an acquaintance of ours weve er weve known him for years
very impressive the way you contained that explosion what else have you done
i dont understand
telekinesis teleportation spontaneous combustion of someone you didnt like that sort of thing
amanda what q is asking is have you ever deliberately used your abilities
not until i came here the first time it happened was when the container almost fell on commander riker
and you handled that very well thats why i gave you a greater challenge the warp core breach

she has potential this one i see no reason why she cant come back to the continuum right now
what
q
i dont want to go anywhere
dont worry with time youll overcome the disadvantages you suffered as a child no one will hold it against you for having been human lets go

leave me alone im not going anywhere with you

you agreed that she has a right to choose her own future the first chance you get you try to abduct her
youre overreacting as usual picard i was merely testing her power shes quite a little spitfire now isnt she
whats going on q whats your real purpose here
i think ive been perfectly clear the continuum has a vested interest in this young woman
if you wish to protect that investment i suggest that you approach her differently
she was being impetuous shell just have to start behaving like a q
if im not mistaken she just did

you understand dont you its just that i have these things that i want to do im going to the academy i want a career and i want to join starfleet
you can still do those things
it just seems so complicated now these powers that i have are just going to stand in the way i dont want to have to deal with it
well youre going to have to listen i can only imagine how you feel and it would be easier if this had never happened or if it would just go away but its not going to go away and you need someone to help you and the person who can help you is q
hes so horrible
he is the only one who can help you to understand who you are amanda you are going to have to make some hard choices about your future and you cant make them if youre going to ignore the truth
yeah i know but i dont want any of this to disrupt my time here i want to do everything that im expected to do and i dont want you to treat me any differently please
youve got a deal the first free hour you have i want to see you in the medical lab i have an experiment i need help with
yes maam


your progress q
as anticipated there are some problems i need time however there is a possibility we wont have to terminate her


come in
hello my dear ive been told i behaved badly i apologise apparently you had every reason to chastise me but then again whats done is done right
id like to ask you some questions
anything
what exactly are the q
it would be so much easier to show you than to tell you if you would agree to take a short visit to the continuum
no just tell me
well to put it simply were omnipotent theres nothing nothing we cant do
and what do you do with this power
anything we want
do you use it to help others
i think youve missed the point my dear clearly youve spent far too much time with humans as a q you can have your hearts desire instantly whatever that may be would you like precious jewels works of art would you like to walk along the rings of tautine
im not interested in any of those things
of course not youre a q but surely there must be something that you want something that you never dreamed was possible tell me amanda what is it
id like to know what my parents looked like my real parents
how quaint so do it
what do you mean
summon the image
i dont know how
think about them evoke the memory you can do it amanda trust me close your eyes close your eyes in your mind return to the time when you were an infant think about your parents remember them good good now open your eyes

they loved me

wait for it to be metabolised add another twenty wait for it to be metabolised over and over and then wait till the bacilli cant be absorbed any more
thats right just be sure and record the rate of mitosis from each of the dishes
mitosis right
you seem distracted
well i just saw my parents my real parents q showed me how can you imagine how that felt
no i dont think i can
you know you were right i cant ignore whats happened to me i just dont know if i can cope with it
amanda you are stronger than you think
you know when i saw them there right in front of me i realised that i caused this to happen i wanted to see them and i did if it were you if suddenly you could have anything you wanted what would it be
i have no idea
no think about it really think if suddenly you could make anything happen what would it be
well i would probably want to heal people people who are hopelessly ill
would you bring your husband back
amanda i dont know and i dont think i could make a decision like that until i was actually faced with it
i am faced with it
try to do the work ill come back and check on you later

i thought shed never leave
i dont know if ill ever get used to that
its time for another lesson
well i have to finish this experiment first
what are you doing
were delivering live vaccine bacilli to tagra im supposed to find the best nutrient solution so we can keep them living while theyre in stasis
fascinating ive just had a splendid idea why dont we combine what youre doing with our lesson and well show you how to finish in no time
well i think that i should finish it the way doctor crusher showed me
why im sure shell be delighted if we sped things along think what it would mean you could double even triple the work load
well
good
i guess so
now as you take a look at the tissue samples form an image in your mind

number one doctor crusher has some live vaccine bacilli to be delivered to tagra itll have to be shipped in a stasis field will you make the arrangements
ill get right on it
captain message coming in from tagra four
on screen
enterprise i am orn lote engineer we are having difficulties with the reactor that powers the barystatic filters on our southern continent we may have to shut it down for repairs
perhaps my chief engineer could be of assistance
i hope so if we are forced to disable the reactor it would take months to reestablish the ionic currents the filters have formed in the atmosphere
send us your design specifications im sure well be able to help
thank you captain

captain
what is it mister data
i have some information regarding amanda rogers parents records indicate that they died in topeka kansas their home was destroyed during a tornado
a tornado why wasnt it dissipated by the weather modification net
unknown sir the bodies were found in the rubble after the storm had passed
see if you can find out any more details mister data id like to know more about that storm
aye sir

well if it isnt number two
i was looking for doctor crusher i didnt know what nutrients she wanted to send with the bacilli
im not sure ill tell her to contact you
thanks
you could stay here and wait for her if you you know wanted to
just tell her ill be in shuttlebay two

youre attracted to him
i am not
i think you are how repulsive how do you stand that hair all over his face

doctor commander riker was just here looking for you he said hed be in shuttlebay two
thank you have you finished already
yes
how did you do it so quickly
q helped me it took us about half the time that it would have normally taken us
that explains this data i needed to know the rates of mitosis by artificially inflating them you made the experiment useless now i have to do it all over again
im sorry doctor
dont be sorry if she wants to make things difficult on herself thats her business
why did you interfere with what she was doing
shes a q making her plod through human chores is beneath her
she has asked not to be treated differently
that doesnt mean she should be bored to death
i dont interfere with what youre teaching her
you wouldnt be capable of interfering
i dont think its too much to ask for you to do the same

and you stay out of mine
well when you put it like that i think youre absolutely right

captain
yes mister data
i have further information regarding the tornado that killed amanda rogers parents
what is it
it was unusually compact yet extremely powerful its recorded wind velocity was characteristic of a funnel three times its size
download the files to my ready room ill study them there
aye sir

have you been practicing your teleportation
yes but its kind of hard i keep ending up somewhere i dont want to be
well it wont do to be sloppy you should hone your abilities i have a wonderful idea why dont we play a little game ill hide somewhere on the ship and you find me
but how do i know how

dont worry amanda you can do it


not bad not bad at all

if we can use phase buffers we may be able to devise a mechanism that can be integrated into the present system while it is in operation

youre still thinking like a human



now do you understand what do humans have to offer you that even begins to compare with that your future contains wonders you cant even imagine the universe could be your playground

doctor crusher and counsellor troi theyre taking me to dinner
you dont have to eat you know its a nasty human habit you could easily do without

hello amanda are you ready
yes


well amanda how are you feeling about all this now it must be overwhelming
it was at first but actually now im enjoying myself
hello ladies
hello will
commander riker er wont you join us
id love to but i have other plans

hi
hi
so how are your lessons going is q being patient with you amanda



what is this all about
i thought it might be nice to spend some time alone together
i think it would be nice if you took us back to ten forward
are you sure you wouldnt want to stay here with me for a while the moonlight is so beautiful isnt it nicer here than at ten forward
yes its very pleasant but thats not the point
oh i think it is

no you cant just snatch people and put them in your fantasies and expect them to respond
dont you like me even just a little bit
youre a very lovely young lady but none of this is real
my feelings are real
i know but you cant make someone love you
cant i

oh amanda you are so beautiful

do you love me
more than anything
youre right none of this is real i thought it would be romantic but its empty
amanda
just go back to ten forward

bon jour mon capitane you wanted to talk with me
i wanted to ask you about amandas biological parents when they decided to remain on earth what was the reaction in the q continuum
we found it incomprehensible
were they pressured to return were they threatened with any punishment if they didnt
what are you driving at picard
well the circumstance of their deaths quite odd a tornado somehow escaped the weather modification net and touched down in only one spot amandas home
well you never can predict the weather
but tornadoes develop from existing storm fronts but you see there were no storm fronts in kansas that day witnesses reported that the funnel materialised spontaneously directly over amandas home destroyed it and disappeared
if you say so i wasnt there
were amandas parents executed by the q continuum
and what if they were
then i think she has a right to know that before she makes a choice about her future
dont be foolish picard she has no choice she never did if shes truly q then she must return to the continuum where she belongs but if she were some kind of hybrid neither human nor q then 
you would be so despicable
dont be naive you have no idea what it means to be q with unlimited power comes responsibility do you think it is reasonable for us to allow omnipotent beings to roam free through the universe
so what have you concluded does she live or does she die
i havent decided yet
captains log stardate  we have arrived at tagra four and have begun delivering supplies in the meantime i am faced with a crisis of a different nature

look i have no reason to believe that q is lying he claims he has orders from the continuum if amanda cannot prove that she is fully q then he must kill her
we have to tell her
i dont know if we should it almost seems cruel
maybe she can protect herself after all she has a great deal of power
so did her parents it didnt save them
i agree with the counsellor amanda deserves to know the truth of her situation we have no right to withhold such crucial information from her but it isnt going to be easy telling her

whats your impression of the field modulator mister lote
quite ingenious quite ingenious indeed  im amazed at the way it can be incorporated with the existing system
commander were all loaded here we can head for the surface whenever youre ready
im eager to see the field modulator in place commander

wed better get going
yes

kill me but why
theyre not convinced that you are fully q and they are also responsible for your parents death
my parents but what right do they have q answer me are you afraid to face me
shes such a plucky little thing now isnt she i really do enjoy you you know
amandas question deserves an answer q youve made yourself judge jury and if necessary executioner by what right have you appointed yourself to this position
superior morality
yes i recall how you used your superior morality when we first encountered you you put us on trial for the crimes of humanity
the jury is still out on that picard make no mistake
your arrogant pretence at being the moral guardians of the universe strikes me as being hollow q i see no evidence that you are guided by a superior moral code or any code whatsoever you may be nearly omnipotent and i dont deny that your parlour tricks are very impressive but morality i dont see it i dont acknowledge it q i would put human morality against the qs any day and perhaps thats the reason that we fascinate you so because our puny behaviour shows you a glimmer of the one thing that evades your omnipotence a moral centre and if so i can think of no crueller irony than that you should destroy this young woman whose only crime is that shes too human
jeanluc sometimes i think the only reason i come here is to listen to these wonderful speeches of yours but this time your concern is unwarranted weve decided not to harm her and were prepared to offer her a choice
what kind of choice
you can either come to the continuum with me
or
now this choice is more difficult you have it within yourself the ability to refrain from using the power of q if you can do that you can stay here
then im staying here
think about this this is not so easy your parents were given this choice and they were unable to resist the temptation of using their power
all ive wanted since this whole thing began is to become a normal human being again i know i can resist
worf to picard there is an emergency message from commander riker
im on my way

captain the damage to the reactor is greater than the tagrans led us to believe the field modulator is installed and operational but its not going to be enough the reactor has already gone into overload
can you correct the problem
geordi is trying to stabilise the unit now we will stay as long as possible there are thousands of people in the area if that reactor goes
commander over here quickly
is this your doing q
not this time picard

mister worf see if theres any way we can do to cut through the interference and beam them out of there
aye sir

captain geordi is trying a neutrino infusion it may smother the reaction
captain there is too much ionisation in the atmosphere transporters are useless
its no use the heat has fused the injectors shut were losing containment
how long till meltdown
a few minutes at most going to have to
commander look at this
this is impossible captain i dont know whats happening but the reaction is stabilising on its own

captain i am reading a massive energy fluctuation in the planets atmosphere
on screen

atmospheric contaminants have dropped to less than one part per trillion the ecosystem has been restored to its natural state
amanda

i told you it would be harder to resist than you thought
i couldnt let all those people die

ever since i got here ive been fighting this ive been denying the truth denying what i am i am q doctor crusher ive decided that i cant stay i cant stay here
well now that youve come to your senses lets go
no i want to go and see my parents first its going to take some time to explain all this so youll have to be patient

i hope i can come back and see you
youre a q you can do anything you want
rascals

captains log stardate  ensign ro keiko obrien guinan and i are returning to the enterprise after a fascinating visit to the planet marlonia

and i found these pieces in the tertiary level of the dig theyre typical of second century marlonian cookware look at those markings theyre very similar to early taguan designs but the patterns are more intricate theyre much closer to buranian than taguan
you were on the most beautiful planet in the quadrant and you spent your entire shore leave in a cave
it was a very rewarding experience look at these fragments theyre very nearly in perfect condition and yet theyre seven hundred years old
sos my father
is that a draebidium froctus

actually its a draebidium calimus you can tell by the shape of the leaves i didnt know you were interested in plant biology
i took a class at the academy i dont remember very much though
enterprise to shuttlecraft fermi
this is the fermi go ahead enterprise
we have just received a distress signal from the starfleet science team on ligos seven
can you identify the problem
no sir the call was cut off in midtransmission
lay in a course and prepare to engage at warp eight as soon as were on board
aye sir
well rendezvous with the ship in three minutes sir

were caught in some kind of energy field
hard about full impulse
aye sir

whats happening mister worf
the shuttle has been enveloped by an energy field its engines and life support have failed
increase to full impulse bridge to transporter room three prepare to beam the shuttle crew back once were in range
ready sir

i cant contact the enterprise theres too much interference
transfer auxiliary power to the inertial dampers
warning structural failure imminent

have you got them obrien
im trying sir

i cant get a pattern lock
the shuttle is

coming apart chief weve got to do it now

ive got them theres a forty percent drop in mass

i may have lost one of them


thank you mister obrien another moment and


according to the bioscans their dna structure is now consistent with those of preadolescence but as far as we can tell only their bodies were changed
their individual intelligence and their behavioural responses are exactly the same as they were before the accident
what happened to the shuttlecraft number one
the shuttle broke up just after we beamed you out mister data is coordinating the salvage efforts now sir
what about the energy field the shuttle passed through
weve trying to scan it but its were running into lot of interference its going to take some time
we cant afford to stay here any longer well leave a class four probe behind to study the energy field but the distress signal from ligos seven has top priority let me know as soon as you have any further information doctor number one youre with me
captain i need to run some additional tests
of course the three of you will remain as needed to assist doctor crusher

what
you know you make a pretty cute kid
great just what i want to be cute
were you this much fun when you were a kid
i was in a refugee camp fun wasnt exactly in my vocabulary
what about now youre not in that camp anymore
fun is being back at work in my own uniform

bridge

mister worf prepare to launch a class four probe to study the energy field

i realise how unusual this must seem my appearance is the result of an accident involving myself and three other crew members the effects of which doctor crusher is currently working to remedy i assure you i am captain picard

the probe aye sir
mister data have you secured all of the shuttle debris
almost it is being stored in shuttlebay two sir
very well ensign as soon as mister data is finished take us to ligos at warp eight
captain may i see you privately for a few moments
of course

tea earl grey hot have you been able to determine the cause of our transformation
not yet im still waiting for some test results
i see there are one hundred and three members of the science team on ligos seven we should prepare shuttlebay three for a triage centre in case they have large numbers of casualties
well be ready
i see that ligos seven is prone to periodic volcanic activity perhaps the planet has entered an active phase
jeanluc we need to talk
all right lets talk are you here to relieve me of duty
id rather not have to take that step
i am still jeanluc picard my judgement my experiences my mental capacities are all intact
thats true for now but this could be the first stage of a condition that may begin to affect your mind as well
but you see no evidence of that
not yet what i do know is that the captain of this ship has undergone an extreme physical transformation the ultimate effects of which i cant even begin to guess
you are asking me to step down
you are still jeanluc picard what do you think you should do

commander riker please take command of the ship until further notice
understood

so what the hell am i supposed to do now
youre not supposed to do anything thats what relieved of duty means
well i should be doing something instead of just standing around waiting for them to find a cure
youre right lets go play
what
i havent been young for a long time and i intend to enjoy every minute of it
fine enjoy yourself
what are you going to do go back to your room and pout
i am not twelve years old if i want to go to my quarters and contemplate my situation that does not mean that i am pouting
okay okay


i could use a cup of coffee how about you
ill get it two coffees one with cream and sugar the other
black double sweet
i know one double sweet
careful thats hot
miles
sorry

whats wrong
its i dont know but this feels wrong somehow
miles edward obrien i am still your wife
well technically yes
technically
no i mean of course youre my wife but youre also ten years old
beverly said its actually closer to twelve
thats not the point
so what is the point is our marriage over
i didnt say that but until they find a way to reverse this this effect its going hard for me to ignore the fact that youre a little girl
what if they cant find a way what if im like this the rest of my life what does that mean for us for our family
mommy mommy

whats wrong sweetheart
i want mommy to read me a story
all right what story would you like to hear
not you i want mommy

what if daddy reads you a story tonight will that be okay ill be right back

keiko its going to be all right i promise well work this out
how
i dont know
first officers log supplemental the enterprise has reached the ligos system and we have begun to search for the missing federation science team doctor crusher reports no progress on a cure for the members of the shuttle crew


come
i came to see how youre doing
ill have to speak to my tailor but otherwise im well thank you its just so ridiculous i cant really take myself seriously like this counsellor if doctor crusher cant find a cure if i have to stay this way nobodys going to take me seriously are they
i would say the people that know you and have worked with you will be able to make the adjustment eventually but there are some people who would find it difficult to accept a twelve year old captain
in that case i suppose ill just have to wait until i grow up again before i get another command which might be in ten maybe fifteen years the question is what to do until then
youre still a starfleet captain im sure there are other assignments you could be given in the interim
 ive spent thirty years of my life aboard starships im not about to sit behind a desk now
you could return to the academy take another degree brush up on your latin
and be wesley crushers room mate i will admit that returning to the academy does have a certain appeal but ive spent my life looking forward going to the academy again feels like looking backward
then perhaps you could spend the time exploring another interests archeology for instance
leave starfleet
not permanently just a sabbatical you could spend a few years crawling through caves and digging up artefacts and still have enough time to become the youngest admiral in starfleet history
it would give me a chance to take up doctor langfords offer and accompany her to the ruins on suvin four but to leave the enterprise
in a way youre very lucky you might have a chance do what most people can only dream about have a second childhood without the pain of growing up again

this is captain picards ryboviroxicnucleic structure from a tissue sample i took this morning its the same as a sample i took before the accident except its missing several of the key viroxic sequences
its been a long time since i took genetics doctor
rvn is one of the key factors in our development during puberty unlike dna which never changes rvn takes on some additional viroxic sequences during adolescence those sequences determine how we develop physically
without them we would never mature into adults
exactly somehow those sequences were eliminated in the captain and the others during transport
so what do we do
well we have a couple of options these are the plants keiko was carrying on the shuttle whatever turned the crew into children turned these plants into seedlings i accelerated the growth on one of them and it developed into a perfectly normal adult plant
i dont suppose that would work with people
no but at least we know that if we do nothing at all they will probably grow up just as they did before
thats one option
however i do have the adult rvn patterns of all four of them i might be able to send them back through the transporter pattern buffer and replace the missing sequences but we cant even attempt that until we know why this happened in the first place if somehow they were to lose more viroxic sequences
they would get even younger

chief i got the sensor report on the shuttle breakup it looks like the breakup began near the starboard bulkhead
therere some bulkhead fragments over here
my visors picking up some torsional stress damage some microfractures hang on a second whats this
it looks like tritanium from the hull
yeah but look

thats not tritanium anymore somehow the molecular structure of this alloys been changed broken down into its constituent elements
no wonder the bulkhead shattered
yeah i want to get a sample of this down to engineering and run a metallurgical analysis

well this is exciting
would you rather be playing with dolls
id rather be doing almost anything other than sitting here and watching you sulk
this isnt some kind of glorious second childhood guinan our bodies have been violated changed doesnt that bother you
sure it bothers me but at the moment i cant do anything about it so i might as well enjoy it
enjoy what where did you get the idea that being short and awkward is some kind of wonderful gift
there mustve been some part of childhood that you didnt loathe
look it was a long depressing period of my life and i was grateful when it was finally over id rather not relive it
i bet you were a jumper a jumper you know someone who jumped up and down on furniture all the time
what
you were a jumper all right the quiet ones they always look so innocent you think you can turn your back on them next thing you know bam theyre bouncing on the bed
that is the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard most of the time i didnt even have a bed
ah but you did have one sometimes and i bet you jumped on it
i most certainly did not
yeah i can see it in your eyes you can barely resist the urge to leap up and start jumping around like a tarkassian razorbeast
guinan
oh yeah oh yeah

this is ridiculous
thats right and dont you dare join me ro laren you dont like jumping on beds
oh yeah i can jump higher

we think the shuttle was caught in a molecular reversion field which caused the structure of the ship to deteriorate when the field penetrated the hull it also began to affect the shuttles crew
when i tried to beam them off i wasnt able to get a lock because the reversion field was masking part of the patterns
if the transporter only registered part of the rvn patterns that would explain why the key sequences are missing
exactly with those key sequences missing the transporter reconstructed them as children
if theyre right would you be able to use the transporter to reverse the effects
i think so as long as theres no reversion field to mask their patterns we should be able to do it chief can you adjust the molecular imaging scanners to accept
bridge to commander riker
go ahead
we are entering orbit around ligos seven sir
on my way well discuss this later

standard orbit ensign any sign of the science team
weve been scanning the area since entering the system but our readings are being disrupted
cause
extreme fluctuations in the electromagnetic field however there is no evidence of stellar or seismic activity which would cause the interference
any response to our hails mister worf
no sir i have been attempting to commander two ships decloaking fore and aft klingon birds of prey brel class

maximum shields take us out of orbit ensign mister worf prepare to return fire

damage report
weve lost primary life support switching to secondary systems
lock phasers on target bearing to port
phasers locked
fire
minor damage to one ship its shields are holding
starboard power coupling is down warp engines are offline
shields
down to thirteen percent

casualties reported on decks twenty six and twenty seven
sensors and secondary generators are offline life support down to sixty seven percent
engineering status report

those last shots took out auxiliary power and emergency backup its going to take at least an hour to get

warp power back online
we have lost shields heavy casualties on decks thirty five through forty
i am detecting transporter signatures in three cargo bays we are being boarded sir


come with me

initiate intruder alert all security teams report to

put down your weapons

computer deactivate all command functions authorisation riker omega three
all command functions suspended

this is morta we have secured the bridge begin transporting all ablebodied adults to the surface


come on get up there up up

they have locked out the command functions
you said they would not have time
you led the assault team you were too slow
you dare to blame me

we have secured the ship daimon but mortas incompetence has denied us access to
my incompetence daimon you know that i am
enough where is the captain of this ship
im in command of this vessel who are you and on whose authority do you
i am daimon lurin and i declare this ship to be a loss and open to claim according to the ferengi salvage code you will cooperate with our salvage operations or we will begin executing your crew


is everyone all right
no fatalities or injuries among the children the ferengi have taken control of main engineering and decks twenty three through thirty seven
we have to assume theyve also taken the bridge
captain do you know what theyve done with the younger children with my little girl
theyre taking all the adults down to the surface it looks like theyre keeping all the children on board the ship where was your daughter
in primary care on deck fourteen
shes probably still there with the others i wouldnt worry we need to regain control of the ship options
we could flood the ship with anesthizine gas
thats been locked out with the rest of the command functions
if theyre typical ferengi theyre probably very pleased with themselves by now maybe even getting a little overconfident
agreed they might think they dont need as much of their crew to hold the ship we could use the element of surprise to give us a tactical advantage
tactical advantage jeanluc look at your team for a minute were children
we cant just stay here while our ship is being commandeered
im not suggesting that we do but we cant act as if we were still adults
what do you suggest we do
we look like children maybe its time we started acting like children

i hope your profit margins pretty high for this little adventure because youre risking war with the federation
were not affiliated with the ferengi alliance we are in business for ourselves yes it will be highly profitable for an investment of two surplus klingon ships a few repairs and some weapons weve netted a federation starship and her crew not to mention a planet rich in vendarite
so thats what this is all about what did you do with the science team that was on the surface
they have proved most helpful in extracting the mineral
you used them as slave labourers
the addition of your crew will greatly speed up the process as for your ship im sure that it will fetch a handsome price on the romulan market but before that can happen we need to regain access to your central computer
you dont really think im going to help you
i think that the mines on ligos seven can be very hazardous now how many people on your ship
one thousand fourteen
very hazardous commander


hello im the classroom computer system what can i do for you today
computer display interior security grid
im sorry but i cant do that would you like to play a game
no i would not computer display an internal schematic diagram
im sorry but i cant do that would you like to see some interesting plants or animals
its a childs computer remember computer can you show me a picture of the inside of the enterprise
yes i can the enterprise is a galaxyclass starship do you know how to spell enterprise e n t e
delete audio all right thisll have to do were here theres a service conduit that runs to here and then leads to a jeffries tube here but you and ensign ro will still have to cross this corridor before you can get to main engineering

captain
excellent ready make it so

what the devil
i was just playing im sorry captain
alexander would you mind if i borrowed your toy for a little while
go ahead
thank you

after you






ive got the phasers captain


this is the first time these jefferies tubes havent seemed cramped
 how much farther do we have to go
about fifty metres dont tell me youre tired
im not as young as i used to be






this is it main engineering now we wait


report
mission accomplished sir the one in sickbay never saw me
very good
id say were ready have you figured out how to get to the bridge
 im afraid i can only think of one way

what do you want
i need to see my father
go back inside
i need to see him right now
do not argue with me go back inside
i need to see him now now now now now now now now stop it youve hurt me i want my father i want my father
all right just stop that

let me go
here he is now be quiet
what is going on
dad

so son how are you
im okay
and how are your friends keiko guinan and ro
theyre okay too but
whats wrong
we dont have anything to do none of the games are working
i know the ferengi made daddy turn off the main computer
cant you just turn on the kids computer in schoolroom eight we just want to play a few games
i dont know if theyll let me do that jeanluc but i will ask
thanks number one hes my number one dad

here they come
how did it go did commander riker get the message
he understood we should have access very soon

come in
i understand your son was here to see you
thats right
we ferengi do not bring our offspring along with us aboard ship
then i suppose thats your loss we consider our families one of our strengths
i think you will find that they can also be a weakness unless you release the computer to our control i will execute every child on this ship beginning with yours
even you wouldnt be that cruel
it is cruel to put children in danger by bringing them aboard a starship in the first place
all right just so you dont harm my son
you will release the computer and show morta exactly how to use it


computer release command control this station authorisation riker omega three
command functions restored
okay morta the enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processing cores crosslinked with a redundant melacortz ramistat fourteen kiloquad interface modules the core element is based on an ftl nanoprocessor with twenty five bilateral kelilactirals with twenty of those being slaved into the primary heisenfram terminal now you do know what a bilateral kelilactiral is
well of course i do human i am not stupid
no of course not this is the isopalavial interface which controls the main firomactal drive unit dont touch that youll blow up the entire firomactal drive
what wait what is a firomactal drive just explain it to me
that is the firomactal drive unit it controls the ramistat core and also keeps the ontarian manifold at forty thousand krgs

the firomactal drive is powered by

command lockout has been released accessing transporter weapons deactivation programme is in place transporter security field standing by were ready



tag
youre it


yes
i found this in the school room is it yours





thats all of them except for the two on the bridge wait here until i return
yes sir

so one more time the ramistat kiloquad capacity is a function of the square root of the intermix ratio times the sum of the plasma injector quotient


come in

i believe youre in my chair
 we have taken lurin and his men into custody the ferengi alliance has quickly disavowed any knowledge of these renegades with the mining operation closed and our crew back on board we can now turn our attention to other problems

phase inducers activated energy levels nominal
im loading the adult patterns into the buffer
transposition matrix locked in that should do it captain
energise

how do you feel
i feel fine everything seems a little smaller


its my mother the funny thing is i never really drew a picture of her when i was young its just for some reason i wanted to now
thats the wonderful thing about crayons they can take you to more places than a starship
its my turn isnt it
only if youre ready
its not quite as bad as i remembered it being a child i mean well wed better get going
well whats the hurry i mean the transporter will still be there why dont you pass me the royal blue
here
thank you did you do this one too
i did all of them
all of them
a fistful of datas

captains log stardate  the enterprise has entered orbit of deinonychus seven but our scheduled rendezvous with the supply ship biko has been delayed for another forty eight hours in the meantime many members of the crew are taking advantage of the delay to pursue their own projects myself included


computer stop playback change the clarinet to an oboe continue recording

computer pause playback come

yes gentlemen
captain wed like your permission to take the engineering computer offline for a couple of hours were working on a new interface that would allow data to act as an emergency backup in the event of a shipwide systems failure
in theory my neural network should be able to sustain key systems until primary control is restored
it sounds like an intriguing experiment ill be interested to see the results permission granted
its possible we may even be able to run secondary systems through data weapons control sensor arrays
yes i get the idea mister la forge thank you please proceed

computer begin playback from the first measure

computer pause recording come

jeanluc i need to talk to you about something for breakfast
breakfast
the play
ah yes well its a very intriguing drama but i really dont have the time it would take to learn a part and anyway im not much of an actor
thats no problem
oh
well you wouldnt be playing one of the leads
oh
its a very small part only two lines
really
you play the butler
well ill think about it and let you know
you would be wonderful jeanluc were rehearsing today at one thirty

computer begin playback from the first measure

computer pause recording yes

captain i am sorry to interrupt
no please mister worf come in
i was hoping to take advantage of the bikos delay by staging shipwide security drills i have planned a tentative schedule
oh yes this is very impressive mister worf but well be taking on new personnel at starbase one eighteen in a few weeks surely the drills can wait until then
in that case i will use the time to perform maintenance checks on the forward phaser array
mister worf is there some reason why youre trying to give yourself more work
no sir i simply wish to use the extra time
enjoy yourself you have the free time use it
yes sir thank you sir

computer continue recording and playback once more from the top


father what did he say
the captain saw fit to release me from my duties
you mean you can go
i can go
saddle up father



where are we
deadwood nineteenth century earth the ancient west
what is our function here
youre the sheriff and im the deputy
so we are in law enforcement
right


geordi i have noticed that you have not shaved are you attempting to grow another beard
as a matter of fact i am data what do you think
as is the case with many natural growth processes it is difficult to envision the end product based on an intermediate stage
youre right give it a few more days

okay im going to need to access your auxiliary inputs
one moment

i must admit data i never get used to seeing you like this
i do not understand you are constantly working on similar electronic systems yet their appearances do not disturb you
but youre not just another electronic system
thank you geordi nor are you just another biological organism
all right that should do it are you ready
yes establishing computer linkup interface complete
all right lets see what you can do


you wrote this holodeck programme yourself
well mister barclay helped a little
i must have a little talk with mister barclay



if i ever find the varmint who drew this hell be sorry he ever put pen to paper im ten times uglier than that aint i

shut up you laugh so much its a wonder you aint got flies in your mouth
youre a very funny man senor eli

thats the bad guy his names eli hollander they call him the butcher of bozeman hes killed twenty three men hes the meanest and the toughest gunslinger in the west you have to watch him hes fast
so i am here to apprehend him
if you can
you are under arrest
is that so

you will come with me
no no no computer freeze programme
what is wrong
that was too easy it has to be harder to beat the bad guys otherwise its no fun computer increase programme difficulty to level four go back to where my father and i first walked into the saloon come on father

if i ever find the varmint who drew this hell be sorry he ever put pen to paper im ten times uglier than that aint i

shut up you laugh so much its a wonder you aint got flies in your mouth
youre a very funny man senor eli

where are they going
they dont want to get hit by the bullets
you are under arrest
well looks like sheriff worfs here to arrest me that dont sound like a bright idea

do it
you have been accused of committing a homicide
if you mean murder then i guess im guilty ive killed twenty three men sheriff one more aint going to make much of a difference of course shooting someone as ugly as you couldnt be considered a crime could it was you just born that way or did your momma marry an armadillo

sheriff look out

im beginning to see the appeal of this programme
dont twitch a whisker sheriff unless you want a shave  okay boys saddle up but first get their money and jewellry
you are a murderer and a thief
a mans got to make a living

i suggest you find a new line of work
i asked counsellor troi to join us she loves western stories
youll regret this stranger


i am now attempting to access the long range sensor array
forward sensor array coming online were getting a clear scan
i will perform a routine maintenance check on the starboard inertial damping system
dampers online maintenance check in progress data i think were on to something here lets see what you can do with secondary systems try gravitational control
initiating gravitational

whats wrong
there appears to be an energy fluctuation in my neural net i am disconnecting my interface to the computer interface deactivated
you all right
i have experienced a brief power surge in my positronic subprocessor but i am fine
 maybe the interface coding isnt as stable than we thought looks like weve got a couple of hours of systems analysis before we can try this again lets check the interface programming



what are his rights in this century is there be a trial or shall i execute him
were supposed to hold him until the us marshal comes and then well take him to rapid city for a trial
frankly i dont think ill be around here that long not after my old man hears about this
what old man are you referring to
my pa when he breaks me out of this tin can the gravediggerll be working overtime
your pas no match for sheriff worf
yes when your pa comes we will be ready for him
 hes right youre no match for the hollanders
i am sure the three of us can handle any problems
hold on i was just passing through town saw a little trouble thought id lend a hand but i aint one of your deputies sheriff
counsellor i would appreciate some support in this matter
durango im called durango
yes er counsellor durango perhaps you would consider becoming a temporary deputy
for a price five hundred dollars
alexander we require large amounts of currency
yes sir ill go to the bank and make a withdrawal

deanna how do you know so much about this period in earths history
my father used to read me stories from the ancient west when i was a little girl i must admit i always wanted to play the part of the mysterious stranger

you are so brave facing down that evil man like you did
why hank you miss
annie you big galoot you best not forget that tonight cos im going to make you beef steak and some gooseberry cobbler for dessert
sounds delicious
and i bought some special candles for the table setting pure beeswax
i will not be able to come this evening i have a prisoner
ill watch him for you sheriff you two go have a good time
thats very considerate of you but i would be negligent in my duties if i did not stay i am sorry miss annie
its another woman aint it its that floozy down there at miss langfords house of pleasure
who

you sure got a way with women sheriff

computer activate picard mozart trio programme one play back tracks one two and three tempo allegro

computer stop playback computer identify musical composition
picard mozart trio programme one

okay lets work through act two from the beginning whenever youre ready

felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature an endothermic quadruped carnivorous by nature
hold it will what are you reading
the lines why
thats not the right dialogue

your visual olfactory and auditory senses contribute to
i recognise it this is datas poetry
what the plays gone i just keep getting more poetry


well the padds are functioning normally it seems to be a problem with the information retrieval net somehow when you tried to call up your play the computer accessed datas literary files
geordi perhaps this problem is related to our interface experiment
wed better run a level two diagnostic on the computer see if this problem has spread to any other systems
and i will perform a selfdiagnostic
thats a good idea
you will let me know if you find the play
oh yeah dont worry its in here somewhere



we got him jefe
wheres my boy
im not supposed to be kidnapped now computer freeze programme hey computer freeze programme
you want us to kill him senor frank
no hes more valuable to us alive

feline supplement one hundred twenty seven spot i have formulated a new mixture of foods specifically designed for your highly selective tastes

i find it extremely difficult to predict what you will find acceptable perhaps hunger will compel you to try it again

spot you are disrupting my ability to work

vamoose you little varmint

whatll it be
i was looking for my deputy perhaps you have seen him
nope whatll you have
klingon fire wine
this aint kansas city we aint got none of that fancy european stuff here maybe i should get you a sherry aint that is what they serve at miss langfords it is aint it aint it

howdy sheriff
commander what are you doing here
the name is frank hollander what are you smiling at
nothing nothing at all mister hollander what is it you want
my boy
that is impossible your son is to stand trial for murder
well then well just have to work something out is there anything you want in exchange for my boy
you have nothing i want
is that so is that so what about your deputy
what about him where is he i do not negotiate with criminals your son will stand trial

not so fast
commander what are you doing
i aint in the mood for games sheriff
data commander computer freeze programme
i wouldnt walk out that door if i was you sheriff



whats wrong
the holodeck safeguards are not functioning alexanders in trouble
my god youve been shot computer end programme troi to captain picard troi to security
theres another character in the programme hollanders father and he looks like commander data

data
but it is not data i cannot explain i believe he has taken alexander
oh now isnt that a shame poor sheriffs been injured whats the matter was my pa a little too rough on you
data
what
why is the computer creating characters that look like data
where have they taken my son where is he
temper temper sheriff my pa aint going to like if i come home all bruised
worf wait we have to remember even though the holodeck safeguards may be off this is still a programme if we can just get to the end of this story the way it was designed to play out the programme will automatically terminate
you are right i will begin by speaking to the people of this town perhaps someone witnessed alexanders abduction
captains log supplemental commander la forge and mister data believe they have found the cause of the mysterious malfunctions which have been plaguing the ship

we think our interface experiment may have caused one of the computers core subroutines to be altered
when the interface malfunction occurred subroutine c forty seven was replaced by elements from my personal programming
what does c forty seven control
library computer access replicator selection recreational programming no critical systems
that would explain why your music composition programme began playing the slavonic dances i have been analysing the collected works of antonin dvorak
its the same with doctor crushers play and with the food replicators
the replicators on decks four through nine are producing nothing but cat food
cat food
i have been formulating nutritional supplements for spot
when can you correct the problem
we are currently attempting to isolate the corrupt circuit pathways i reckon the process should take less then two hours
what did you say
i said the process should take less than two hours
no you said i reckon
according to my memory log i did not use those words yall must be mistaken
there data you did it again
did whut
mister la forge perhaps you should take mister data to engineering see if you can find the problem
aye sir



can i help you with somethin

i spoke to several witnesses who saw alexander being abducted as he was leaving the bank by one of hollanders men we must begin a systematic search of the town
worf weve got another problem i saw eli playing cards he was shuffling the way data does when he plays poker he doesnt just look like data he has datas abilities which means his father probably does also

ive came to see my boy
remove your weapon

better take a good look at that gun sheriff you might be seeing it again real soon
pa
eli how are they treating you boy
real bad pa they aint fed me since i got here and the sheriffs been roughin up on me somethin fierce
dont you worry boy the sheriffs going to pay whos the stranger
dont know she aint said her name but shes in cahoots with the sheriff and shes mighty mean with that winchester
you sit tight boy ill have you home in time for supper im going to give you one more opportunity sheriff to avoid a ugly situation release my boy
i have reconsidered your offer i will release your son in exchange for my deputy
i thought you might have a change of heart meet me in two hours you be in front of the saloon ill be in front of the livery station strangers aint invited
agreed

in every western ive ever read the villains always break their word he cant be trusted
but we have made an honourable agreement
theyre not concerned with honour worf this is the ancient west theres a gunfighter out there who has the speed and accuracy of an android and in two hours hes going to try to kill you


mister data
howdy commander
geordi what have you found
well we figure part of my memory structure  was replaced with information from the computers recreational data base
specifically the files relating to the nineteenth century american west
that would explain the accent
you got it partner
this is a result of the experimental interface
im afraid so but weve initiated a progressive memory purge to restore datas programming to its original state he should be back to normal in a couple of hours
and what about the computers recreational data base
we started a memory purge there as well itll take another hour maybe two
commander you just sit tight well have this all fixed up in time for supper
good


i will be positioned here at the eastern end of the street frank hollander says he will approach from this end when he reaches this point he will be within range
understood what about alexander
theres a rain barrel in front of the saloon it should be enough to stop the bullets

you would not believe what i went through to get old man newsom to give up his telegraph machine

excellent
lord knows why i keep risking my life for you sheriff

oh yes thank you miss annie i am in your debt


i have connected the communicators energy cell to serve as the power source
how long will the field last
no more than fifteen seconds it is highly unstable
lets hope its enough


eli get down
alexander


dont even think about it
senor frank

go ahead shoot me
do not show your face in this town again
lets go

father
are you all right
yes
end programme
i dont understand this the story should be over whats left
computer end programme
sheriff youre as handy with a shooting iron as you are with a womans heart
 computer end programme computer now

captains log stardate  both commander data and the ships computer have been restored to normal operation our rendezvous with the supply ship biko has proceeded as planned


father after what happened i guess youll never want to go back to the ancient west
the town of deadwood may face danger once again if they do they will need a sheriff and a deputy

the quality of life



commander is it your intention to continue to grow your beard
actually im not sure yet why worf
i am just asking
seven card stud oneeyed jacks are wild
frankly geordi i like the beard
thank you commander
you know i have always been a little suspicious of men with beards
why is that
i dont know its as if theyre trying to hide something
hide dont be ridiculous doctor the beard is an ancient and proud tradition
some of the most distinguished men in history have worn beards doctor
i know but after the razor was invented i think beards became mostly a fashion statement
im not concerned with fashion to a klingon a beard is a symbol of courage
i think its a sign of strength
sure and of course women cant grow beards
doctor it sounds to me like you feel beards are nothing more than an affectation
i do but theres nothing wrong with that i mean women wear makeup and nail polish i just think its time you men admitted it
my beard is not an affectation
oh well then you wouldnt mind shaving it off
i could lose it in a minute ive just gotten used to it
okay then why dont we up the stakes a little and if i win all off you shave your beards off
wait a minute wait a minute what if you lose what are you going to give up
im open for suggestions
well ive always wanted to see you as a brunette
oh i did that once when i was thirteen i couldnt change back fast enough
that makes me even more curious
fine if one of you wins i become a brunette are we on
yeah yeah well take that bet
looks like you have the hand to beat commander
two hundred
im in two hundred
geordi
this is the captain we have arrived at the tyran system all senior staff to the bridge
wait
sorry you heard the captain duty calls i guess well have to do this some other time
captains log stardate  we have just come into orbit of tyrus seven a to monitor progress on the tyran particle fountain a radically new mining technology so far the project has been fraught with problems and is well behind schedule mister la forge has been assigned to evaluate the situation


doctor farallon the original design called for the particle fountain to lift five hundred kilograms per minute from the surface so far we havent come close to that
 well thats why i want to increase the stream density that should boost the lift capacity by seventy two percent
yeah but you realise of course youre going to be overloading the field generators in the process
not if we distribute the overload evenly throughout the system
doctor forgive me but maybe we should concentrate on completing this phase of the project before we start talking about re designing it
commander i know youre here to evaluate this project
starfleet is considering using a particle fountain on carema three they want to know how feasible it is
and will your opinion be the deciding factor
no not really ill make my report to captain picard hell make the official recommendation to starfleet theyll decide
whats your feeling so far
well it seems to me the question we should be asking is is this technology is more efficient than conventional mining techniques
commander i know weve had problems here it seems like nothings gone right its taking a lot longer than i thought to get the particle stream to full strength but i know it can work this is the direction that mining is going to take in the future and it should be implemented on carema three
i know this can be potentially very exciting
all right i want to show you something ive been working on something that might help us complete this project more quickly ive used these on a limited basis

enterprise to commander la forge


i am reading significant power fluctuations from the station core please report

la forge here we have a malfunction in one of the power grids were losing particle stream confinement
do you require assistance
stand by im sorry doctor i think were going to have to shut it down
it took four months to get the particle flux up to this level if we shut down itll take another four months just to get it back
look e have less than five minutes before we lose confinement when that happens the particle stream is going to flood this entire station were going to have to shut it down then anyway
then well just have to fix the power grid
yeah bow do we do that the defective grid is two hundred metres down conduit a two we have to disassemble four bulkheads just to get to it
well heres the perfect opportunity to show you what i had in mind

what is this
this is an exocomp the experiment i was telling you about

if it doesnt work well still have time to shut down the fountain
enterprise to la forge what is your situation
unchanged for the moment but were working on it listen if this doesnt work soon were going to have to shut this thing down all right

the confinement field is at full strength particle flux steady all power levels are back to normal

commander la forge please report

were fine data the power grid is fully restored

the malfunction seems to have been repaired and operations over here at the station are all back to normal

how were you able to accomplish the repair so quickly

you know im not exactly sure
captains log stardate  repairs to the particle fountain seem to have succeeded and it is now functioning smoothly doctor farallon is coming aboard to demonstrate the device that carried out the repairs

energise
aye sir

welcome to the enterprise doctor i am lieutenant commander data
mister data i was hoping id have a chance to meet you ive done extensive studies of your positronic network
and i have studied your design for the particle fountain i find the concept to be highly innovative
thank you
i am curious how you were able to repair the power grid so quickly
this should make it clear commander
why dont we set up in engineering
is it true that your computational speed is limited only by the physical separation of your positronic links
actually that is no longer the case i have recently converted my interlink sequencer to asynchronous operation which removed the performance constraint
doctor this way please
i see but how did you resolve the signal fragmentation

the interlink sequencer is now bidirectional it compensates for the asynchronous mode distortion arising from the resonant field
yes thats fascinating does the sequencer require any buffering system to eliminate interference

weve been using devices like this on tyrus seven for years the basic unit is a common industrial servo mechanism a few years ago i started tinkering with one this is the result
boridium power converter axionic chip network its very impressive in terms of sheer computational speed this little guy might be able to compete with you data
oh the exocomps dont come close to datas sophistication
exocomps
thats what i call them lets say you had an antimatter flow converter that was fluctuating how would you repair it
the correct procedure would be to adjust the converter
with what
a mode stabiliser
okay let me input the problem into the exocomp a fluctuating antimatter flow converter now lets see what happens

a mode stabilizer very nice
you have incorporated a microreplication system into the device in order to fashion tools
its more than that i designed the exocomps to be problem solvers whenever they perform a task theyve never done before the microreplicator creates new circuit pathways within the units memory
so in a sense they are learning
exactly the more situations they encounter the more circuit pathways they build they become better tools as they work
its impressive technology thats for sure once its out of the experimental stage therell be plenty of applications
commander im hoping the experimental stage is over when are we supposed to brief captain picard on the status of the particle fountain
at sixteen hundred hours
good ill have a proposal to make

captain i know youre supposed to give your evaluation to starfleet today id like you to postpone that report another forty eight hours
the enterprise is scheduled to leave the tyran system tomorrow if im to change that plan ill need a very good reason
i realise that sir if youre going to make a recommendation to starfleet about using the particle fountain on carema it seems only fair that you should see it operating at full strength
agreed
i think i can complete the project and boost the efficiency of the particle stream if i use exocomps the new devices ive constructed
i understand one of these devices successfully repaired a faulty power grid
yes sir ive been testing them on a limited basis but i think theyre ready to be used on a larger scale
mister la forge what are your thoughts
well i guess the only risk is in falling even further behind
im willing to take that risk
mister data
exocomps are highly sophisticated devices sir if they perform up to expectation their potential to advance this project is considerable
im inclined to agree i dont think that forty eight hours is too much time to risk particularly when the gains areso substantial you may proceed doctor
thank you sir if possible id like commander data to work with me
thank you doctor i welcome the opportunity


commander theres a plasma conduit in one of the access tunnels thats ready to be sealed its the perfect job for an exocomp
i agree doctor
well mister data what is your analysis so far
i have successfully completed fourteen separate tasks with this exocomp in the past hour i estimate it would take two people nine hours to complete the same tasks i would characterise the units performance as excellent
i hope commander la forge and captain picard agree with you
i am confident they will commander la forge is especially

it didnt finish sealing the plasma conduit let me end it back in
it is not accepting your commands
maybe theres a malfunction in the control processor let me see if i can override it

doctor
im all right the control pad just overloaded whats the matter with this thing

second officers log stardate  the unexplained behaviour of the exocomp has greatly puzzled both doctor farallon and myself we have brought the defective unit to the enterprise for investigation


the exocomp came out of the plasma conduit we tried to override the commands and send it back in but it just shut down its been completely unresponsive ever since
well lets see what our computer has to say
geordi the interface circuitry which links the exocomp to the control pad is completely burned out
thats strange is there any evidence of secondary power surges
no
but whats going on there data increase the magnification of section gamma four
interesting the number of new circuit pathways has increased by six hundred thirty two percent
oh no
what is it
sometimes an exocomp starts forming large numbers of new pathways totally at random eventually it reaches a point where it shuts down just like this one
doctor the new pathways do not appear to be interfering with the original circuitry
once the exocomp is this badly corrupted its useless you have to erase the unit and start all over again and theres no time for that now
that leaves you with only two its going to slow you down
yes commander you have the right to point out that you told me so
i only wanted to say that wed be happy to add on an extra shift to pick up the slack
im sorry i guess im touchy these days
its okay youve got a lot on your shoulders
well id better get back to it thanks commander

i feel sorry for her this project has had nothing but problems why did that plasma conduit explode
apparently there was a microfracture in the conduit wall the fault did not register on our instruments
i guess its a good thing the exocomp malfunctioned almost seems like it knew just when to leave
geordi are you implying the exocomp exhibited some form of selfpreservation
of course not
lieutenant pierson to commander la forge sir could you join us in the systems monitor room
on my way

computer perform a level one diagnostic of the exocomps command module
the command pathways are functioning normally
how can that be if the interface circuitry is burned out
the interface circuitry has been repaired
curious computer access the exocomps sensor logs confirm that there was a failure of the interface circuitry within the last twelve hours
confirmed interface failure occurred at eleven hundred fifty hours today when the exocomp produced a power surge which burned out the linkage
how and when was it repaired
the exocomp activated a selfrepair programme at thirteen hundred forty hours
why would the exocomp burn out its own interface circuitry and repair it two hours later
unknown

here you are i thought youd be hard at work by now
i wanted a quiet cup of tea before i went back gathering strength i guess
ive come to tell you ive assigned two engineering teams to work on the particle fountain
thank you commander im grateful
you know i really want you to know that i do admire the work that youve done and im sorry the exocomps arent working out
you were right im trying to move too fast i guess i lack that conservative streak most scientists have i always seem to be out there on the edge taking chances
you know ill bet you were the kind of little girl who was always climbing one branch higher than the other kids
anything to get to the top of the tree
and i bet you never fell
oh no i fell all the time usually breaking a bone in the process i just never let it stop me
well if it comes down to sheer determination i know youll get this particle fountain built
youre right about that commander ive spent the last six years of my life on this project its the first thought i have when i wake up and the last before i go to bed whatever it takes to prove this technology ill do it


doctor if you wish to master the battelh sword you must learn to strike and avoid in the same motion
i almost got in under your guard worf
almost
well ill keep that in mind next lesson

doctor are you injured
only my pride data  thanks

doctor what is the definition of life
 that is a big question why do you ask
i am searching for a definition that will allow me to test an hypothesis

well the broadest scientific definition might be that life is what enables plants and animals to consume food derive energy from it grow adapt themselves to their surroundings and reproduce
and you suggest that anything which exhibits these characteristics is considered alive
in general yes
what about fire
fire
yes it consumes fuel to produce energy it grows it creates offspring by your definition is it alive
fire is a chemical reaction you could use the same argument for growing crystals but obviously we dont consider them alive
and what about me i do not grow i do not reproduce i am considered to be alive
thats true but you are unique
i wonder if that is so
data if i may ask have a seat what exactly are youe getting at
i am curious as to what transpired between the moment when i was nothing more than an assemblage of parts in doctor soongs laboratory and the next moment when i became alive what was it that endowed me with life
i remember wesley asking me a similar question when he was little and i tried desperately to give him an answer but everything i said sounded inadequate then i realised that scientists and philosophers had been grappling with that question for centuries without coming to any conclusion
are you saying the question cannot be answered
no i think im saying that we struggle all our lives to answer it but its the struggle thats important thats what helps us to define our place in the universe
i believe i understand doctor
i dont think ive been very much help data
on the contrary you have been a great deal of help thank you

murphys team will cover gamma shift from twenty three hundred to oh seven hundred hours okay doctor ive split the engineering teams among all the shifts and if nothing else goes wrong that should be enough to help you finish on time
with the help of the exocomps i think we will
do you think theyll toe the line
dont worry they know whos in charge

doctor i must ask you to stop using the exocomps
why is there something wrong with them
no it is not that i have reason to believe the exocomps are alive
captains log stardate  i have summoned the senior staff in order to discuss commander datas theory that the exocomps are a life form doctor farallon has attended only reluctantly

captain i object to being called here im wasting time that could be better spent elsewhere
doctor i appreciate your time constraints but recognising new life whatever its form is the principal mission of this vessel please now mister data will you tell us what makes you think that the exocomps are alive
sir when the exocomp left the access tunnel prior to the explosion it may have been attempting to save itself from destruction
do you have any basis for that conclusion
yes when you attempted to override the exocomp and send it back into the tunnel it responded by deliberately burning out its control interface
deliberately
the computer diagnostic showed that the exocomp disabled its own interface
that could have been nothing more than a malfunction
however two hours later when it was aboard the enterprise and no longer in danger it repaired itself i believe the exocomp was protecting itself and if that is true it has demonstrated an awareness of its environment and an ability to adapt to that environment
youre anthropomorphising these units like any mechanical devices they occasionally malfunction one time i saw an exocomp enter a reaction chamber for no apparent reason and vaporise itself is that supposed to make me think it was depressed and suicidal
doctor why is it so difficult for you to accept the fact that the exocomp could be alive after all youre talking to a living machine right now
and i have nothing but the utmost respect and admiration for doctor soongs accomplishment but his intention was to create an artificial life form i created the exocomps to be tools and there is a big difference between data and a tool
doctor there is a big difference between you and a virus but both are alive
if the possibility exists no matter how slight that these exocomps are lifeforms then we must examine that possibility
thank you sir and until we have a definitive answer i believe it would be inappropriate to exploit the exocomps as labourers
captain thats absurd
if they are intelligent life forms we have no right to force them to work for us
thats like me telling you not to use your tricorder
tricorders arent alive
neither are exocomps
clearly these are difficult issues to resolve we have to proceed very carefully so the first task is to test mister datas hypothesis
data youre claiming that this exocomp may be alive because it demonstrated survival instincts right
yes
then why dont we just threaten its survival again and see what happens
make it so


doctor were pretty much ready here you can begin programming it what weve done captain is to recreate a situation similar to the one the exocomp encountered in the plasma conduit
we have created a small conduit breach in this tube the exocomp would normally require several minutes to complete a repair of this type once it enters the tube it will find that a plasma cascade failure is in progress
i assume this is a simulation
yes sir were running a transient overload signal that will simulate a failure in exactly one minute
if it does possess a survival instinct as mister data claims it will exit the tube before the minute is up in order to save itself
very well proceed
okay beginning test programme now one minute

fifty seconds  thirty seconds  ten seconds five four three two one thats it if this had been for real that conduit wouldve exploded with the exocomp inside go ahead doctor bring it back in
well captain i think weve spent more than enough time answering this question i hope the outcome wasnt too much of a disappointment for you mister data it certainly came as no surprise to me
thank you for your help doctor
youre welcome
well i consider this time well spent
as do i sir thank you

thirty seconds twenty seconds
commander riker said youd still be down here he also said the exocomp failed the test
that is true
time expired test complete
i have completed thirty four additional tests and the results have been the same in each of them perhaps i was wrong in suspecting the exocomp was alive
this was really important to you wasnt it
you said earlier that i am unique if so then i am alone in the universe when i began investigating the exocomps i realised i might be encountering a progenitor of myself suddenly the possibility exists that i was no longer alone for that reason i the exocomp has returned
wasnt its supposed to do that
in the previous thirty four trials i brought it back once the simulated failure occurred this time we were talking and i neglected to do that
i distracted you im sorry
do not apologise doctor i believe we have discovered something significant
what
the exocomp has replicated a different tool that is not the molecular fuser it had when it entered the jefferies tube doctor the exocomp not only completed the repairs it also deactivated the overload signal
i thought this was just a simulation
it was and the exocomp must have realised that it saw that there was no real danger and completed the repairs
and then replicated the correct tool to eliminate the false overload signal
i see no other possible explanation
the exocomp didnt fail the test it saw right through it
captains log stardate  at doctor farallons request i have agreed to tour the station and assess the situation personally i must decide soon whether it is in starfleets best interest to recommend the particle fountain as a reliable technology

were definitely making progress captain im not sure well be at full capacity within the forty eight hour deadline but well be close
it looks like theres still some difficulty with the phase selectors
thats true but im sure its the last real problem
i hope for the sake of the project that i hope youre right doctor
i understand sir were going to do our best

this is strange primary power is still online
maybe its another power grid malfunction
i dont think so something seems to be drawing power into the main particle impeller thats not a good sign it could mean

weve lost internal confinement the particle stream is beginning to surge
captain a radiation field is going to flood this chamber weve got to get everybody out of here immediately
understood doctor the station must be evacuated
captain i might still
that is an order doctor now assemble all personnel on the transporter pad now picard to enterprise

do you read me
riker here sir
radiation field is increasing we are losing communications
prepare for emergency transport
red alert riker to transporter room two prepare for emergency transport

the radiation is setting up a field ionisation effect captain weve got less than a minute to beam out of here
is that everybody
wheres takenta he was over there near the impeller control
ill get him takenta

mister la forge stand by to transport
captain youll be trapped here

mister la forge mister la forge are you all right
yeah im fine captain i only caught the edge of it hes dead

chief do you have them
theyre here sir
is everyone all right
were fine sir but captain picard commander la forge and one of my men

are still on the station
kelso can you get them off

im trying sir i cant establish a pattern lock
commander we barely managed to transport off ourselves the field ionisation is too intense

commander the particle fountain is continuing to surge at the present rate the radiation in the station core will reach fatal levels in twenty three minutes

captain if i can access the field emitters we should be able to establish a force field see if you can link your console to my command system subroutine
all right link established
okay here we go
im reading power fluctuations the force field is not stable
yeah i know the radiation levels are too high the emitters are beginning to deteriorate
how long can we expect it to last
not very long
we have to keep it up long enough for commander riker to get to us
maybe we can help him out see if you can access the emergency shut down routine ill try to activate the ionic dampers

a force field was activated on the station a few moments ago it is possible that commander la forge has established a low intensity deflector field
it wont last long in that radiation
no sir my readings indicate that it will fail in approximately twenty two minutes

okay weve got twenty two minutes i want some options
can we send a shuttlecraft to evacuate them
wed never get there in time
then we need to shut down the particle fountain what if we detonated a low yield photon torpedo within the particle stream wouldnt that shut it down
wed have to configure the torpedo very carefully the shape of the shock wave would be critical but it could work
how long would it take to set that up
i estimate that it would take a minimum of sixty five minutes to properly configure the torpedo
we dont have that kind of time
commander maybe the exocomps can help us i can programme their boridium power cells to explode on command they can be configured just like a photon torpedo but it would only take a couple of minutes
commander i must object to that plan
data weve been through this we tested the exocomp and it failed
doctor crusher and i discovered that the exocomp did not fail the test it is still my belief we are dealing with a new life form
mister data you know how much i respect your judgment but i cant risk the captain and geordi on the basis of your belief prepare the exocomp doctor
commander if i am correct the exocomps will not allow themselves to be destroyed they have a sense of survival and they will shut down before they will comply with the order
i could disconnect their command pathways before i programme them
do it


commander riker were ready

mister worf target two hundred metres below the apex of the particle stream feed the coordinates to transporter room two
aye sir coordinates received
mister kelso

energize

mister kelso

im sorry sir the transporter system just went dead theres some kind of malfunction

run a diagnostic immediately try bypassing the
commander that will not be necessary the transporter is not malfunctioning i have locked out the controls

i gave you a direct order mister data you release that transporter lockout now
i cannot do that sir
if you dont do it i will relieve you of duty
that is your prerogative sir under starfleet regulations direct insubordination is a court martial offence but i will not release the transporter
data those are two of your friends out there they have saved your life more times than i can remember i cant believe youd be willing to sacrifice them like this
commander please do not think this is an arbitrary decision i have considered the ramifications of my actions carefully and i do not believe it is justifiable to sacrifice one life form for another
you dont know that the exocomps are life forms
it is true i am acting on my personal beliefs but i do not see how i can do otherwise
youre risking a lot on the basis of a belief
i have observed that humans often base their judgments on what is referred to as instinct or intuition because i am a machine i lack that particular ability however it may be possible that i have insight into other machines that humans lack
if there were a way to save the captain and geordi without destroying the exocomps i would jump on it but we have run out of time and this is the only solution ive got
then let me offer an alternative transport me to the station i will attempt a complete manual shut down of the particle stream
the radiation levels are too high even for you your positronic net would ionise in no time i cant let you sacrifice yourself
commander if i give my life to save my fellow officers that is my choice the exocomps no longer have a choice
then what if we reconnect their command pathways and we give them a choice youve assumed the exocomps would shut down before accepting this mission what if we ask them if they are willing to proceed
that sounds reasonable sir if they choose to go i would be willing to release the transporter lock out
fair enough

all right ive enabled their command pathways
if the exocomps do not shut down after i have programmed them we may assume they are willing to go

what does that mean are they willing to go or not
they havent shut down
they seem to be reprogramming the commands i have entered
reprogramming them
clearly they unwilling to be transported into the stream for detonation although they may have an alternate solution
something we havent considered are you suggesting they have superior intelligence
no doctor but they do have superior experience during their service they have interfaced with every part of the station core something none of us has done including yourself they may have another way to control the particle surge

those appear to be power taps
sir new coordinates are being fed to the transporter by the exocomps the coordinates are inside the station core
kelso energise
aye sir


mister la forge
what are they up to
the exocomps are siphoning power from the core
theyre trying to distort the particle stream frequency that might open up a window that the enterprise can use to beam us out if they can modulate the radiation field itll work but theyll have to get the subharmonic frequencies to resonance the particle stream frequency is beginning to fluctuate theyre having a little difficulty controlling the feedback it may be more power than they can handle
can we help them is there any way we can moderate the power transfer
no sir weve done all that we can do its up to them now theyre balancing the power absorption rates its working the particle stream is beginning to distort almost at resonance theyve got it
drop the force field

commander ive got a pattern lock
energise

can you lock on to the exocomps
im trying sir

im sorry sir i was only able to lock onto two of them for some reason i couldnt fix a signal on the other one
one of them had to continue disrupting the particle stream absorbing that much power could prevent a signal lock
it was the only way to save the other two

i must admit youve given me a lot to think about commander data i dont exactly know what the exocomps are but you can be assured that until i do i wont be treating them as simple tools
thank you doctor i wish your work on the particle fountain had been more successful perhaps the exocomps will help you to reconstruct it
i hope they will and i predict that in a year or two you will be able to recommend the technology to starfleet
i look forward to it
doctor

something more mister data
yes sir i thought you might want to know why i would be willing to risk your life for several small machines
i think i understand the predicament you were in it could not have been an easy choice
no sir it was not when my status as a living being was in question you fought to protect my rights and for that i will always be grateful the exocomps had no such advocate if i had not acted in their behalf they would have been destroyed i could not allow that to happen sir
of course you couldnt it was the most human decision youve ever made
chain of command part one

captains log stardate  we have rendezvoused with the starship cairo near the cardassian border for an urgent meeting with vice admiral nechayev

come

may i present captain jeanluc picard
admiral welcome aboard
thank you thatll be all commander

can i get you some coffee tea
thank you no captain im afraid theres no time for the usual pleasantries im here to relieve you of command of the enterprise


the cardassian forces which were recently withdrawn from the bajoran sector have been redeployed along the federation border they have mobilised three divisions of ground troops and their subspace communications have been increased by fifty percent we believe that theyre preparing for an incursion into federation space
are the cardassians ready for a war
i didnt say war commander i said incursion our intelligence reports suggests that theyll try to seize one of the disputed systems along the border we think theyre gambling that the federation wont actually go to war over one system
will we
i hope we wont need to make that decision we have decided to send the enterprise to meet with the cardassian representative and open talks were hoping that the presence of the federation flagship on the border will send a message to their leadership about just how seriously we view the situation
wheres captain picard
the captain your chief medical officer and security chief have been reassigned thats all i can tell you for now do any of you know edward jellico
he is the commanding officer of the cairo
ive heard of him i dont know that any of us have
im giving him command of the enterprise this afternoon captain jellico helped to negotiate the original armistice two years ago and i believe hes the most qualified person to lead this mission the change of command will take place at thirteen hundred hours thank you

admiral with all due respect its not necessary to give captain jellico command of the enterprise just to conduct a negotiation
i disagree the enterprise will be in a dangerous situation and i want someone on the bridge who has a great deal of experience with the cardassians no offence commander but thats not you


halt
computer freeze programme you were five seconds slower that time
you increased the difficulty level sir
mister worf its going to be far more difficult where were going
which is where exactly
im sorry i cant tell you that yet
it would be helpful to know something about our mission
mister worf i have my orders im sure you understand that now doctor this deflector wasnt set properly it must be positioned so that the emitter array blocks the entire passageway or its useless
sorry i was concentrating on getting away from the last cardassian or maybe it was the falling rocks
i understand this is difficult all i can do is ask you to trust me
all right lets do it again
all right mister worf i want you to time the doctor and me through that first tunnel and this time were going to pick up those five seconds


welcome aboard sir im commander
william t riker class of fifty seven graduated eighth in his class im looking forward to serving with you commander
thank you and i you
im sure this change in command has taken everyone a little by surprise
well yes sir

it caught me by surprise too i must admit i miss the cairo already but a galaxy class ship thats something special i can understand why you turned down a ship of your own to remain aboard
yes sir
how many duty watches does the crew stand
weve a standard three shift rotation
id like to change that to four starting tonight id also like to examine the duty roster and the crew evaluations as soon as possible i want readiness reports from each department head by fourteen hundred hours and a meeting of the senior staff at fifteen hundred do you prefer will or william
er will sir

where are my quarters will
we have you assigned to cabin seven thirty five deck si
deck seven ill see you at thirteen hundred hours


yeah i know wearing these uniforms reminds me of my first days at the academy
attention to orders
 to captain jeanluc picard commanding officer uss enterprise stardate  you are hereby requested and required to relinquish command of your vessel to captain edward jellico commanding officer uss cairo as of this date signed viceadmiral alynna nechayev starfleet command computer transfer all command codes to captain edward jellico voice authorisation picard delta five
transfer complete uss enterprise now under command of captain edward jellico
i relieve you sir
i stand relieved
dismissed
i wonder how permanent this is going to be
i dont know they dont usually go through the ceremony if its just a temporary assignment
sore
sore doesnt begin to describe it i know i wish i could talk about it
most of the secondary systems were changed at the last overhaul i dont think theyll give you any problems but you might want to check out the port lateral
ill take care of the enterprise jeanluc you dont have to mother me hows your team shaping up
very well but i would prefer more recent intelligence on the exact layout of the installation the most current information we have is two years old
two years i dont know how nechayev ever talked you into this
she gave me no choice
well maybe theres something we can do to help well launch a class five probe just before we reach the border you could pick up the telemetry aboard the shuttle
now that would be extremely helpful
will
captain captain
i believe were scheduled to arrive at the cardassian border during delta shift please inform the delta tactical officer that i want to launch a class five probe just before we drop out of warp
i was actually going to talk to you about delta shift a little later sir right now gamma shift will be on duty when we arrive and i will tell lieutenant mcdowell about the probe
is there a problem with delta shift will
there is no delta shift yet sir i have spoken to the department heads about changing from three shifts to four and they assure me its going to cause us significant personnel problems
so you have not changed the watch rotation
i was going to explain this to you after the ceremony sir
you will tell the department heads that as of now the enterprise is on a four shift rotation i dont want to talk about it get it done now that means delta shift will be due to come on duty in two hours i expect you to have it fully manned and ready when it does is that clear
yes sir if youll excuse me sir captain
he was your first officer for five years
one of the finest officers that i have ever served with
of course he is jeanluc im sure itll all work out
captains log stardate  the enterprise is on course for a rendezvous with the cardassian ship reklar fortunately i still have time to prepare the ship and crew for the task ahead

i want you to install a bypass between the main phaser array and the secondary generators i also want to run the main deflector pathway through the warp power grid and the auxiliary conduits through the lateral relays you may have to reconfigure the transfer interface
sir the transfer interface was not designed for that configuration it will take seven hours to make those changes
sir you may not be aware that our normal interface already routes auxiliary power through three separate relays
im aware of your current design system its not good enough if these negotiations fail we could find ourselves in a war zone and if that happens i want to be loaded for bear
ill get right on it
good now these stations should be devoted to damage control and weapons status from now on see that theyre manned at all times
aye sir
mister data how long before we reach the rendezvous point
we will arrive in fifty one hours thirty two minutes sir
schedule four battle drills one for each shift run a series of simulated attacks from a cardassian squadron i want you to conduct the exercises personally will get it done oh and get that fish out of the ready room data youre with me


power transfer levels need to be upgraded by twenty percent the efficiency of your warp coils is also unsatisfactory
coil efficiency is well within specifications captain
im not interested in the specs geordi the efficiency needs to be raised by at least fifteen percent
fifteen percent
that is an attainable goal but it will require realigning the warp coil and taking the secondary distribution grid offline
very good data thats exactly what i want you to do
if we take this grid offline were going to have to shut down exobiology the astrophysics lab and geological research
were not on a research mission get it done in two days
i believe that is also an attainable goal if we utilise the entire engineering department there should be sufficient manpower available to complete the task
sure if everybody works around the clock for the next two days
then youd better get to it geordi it looks like you have some work to do data


yes
may i speak with you captain
deanna come in come in

the latest masterpieces from my son its an elephant i think
definitely an elephant
im glad youre here id like to go over the duty roster with you
id be happy to but first id like to talk about how the change in command is affecting the crew
ive noticed some resistance
i wouldnt call it resistance more like uncertainty most of them had served under captain picard for several years they knew him they knew what he expected now theyre being asked to adjust to a new captain and a new way of doing things and theyre uncertain how to react
i see your point this all could be very unsettling to them
and to you perhaps everyone just needs some time time for you to get to know and trust the crew and time for them to understand how you want things done
im glad you brought this to my attention deanna unfortunately i dont have time for a honeymoon with the crew youve clearly given this a lot of thought so id like you to take charge of the morale situation please see to it that they make the adjustment to the new routine quickly and easily i have a meeting with the new security chief in five minutes so the duty roster will have to wait thank you counsellor by the way i prefer a certain formality on the bridge id appreciate it if you wore standard uniform when youre on duty
of course sir

commander hes asked me to completely reroute half the power systems on the ship change every duty roster realign the warp coils in two days and now hes transferred a third of my department to security
if it makes you feel any better youre not alone captain jellico has made major changes in every department on the ship
yeah well i dont mind making changes and i dont mind hard work but the man isnt giving me the time i need to do the work someones got to get him to listen to reason
its not going to be me hes made that abundantly clear
well then can i make a suggestion talk to captain picard maybe he can do something we just need a little time
all right


come
are you all right sir
yes i am the last time i had to train like this was for the academy marathon but im managing what can i do for you
its nothing urgent im sorry i bothered you good night

my orders are to maintain radio silence until weve completed the mission
well the enterprise will be monitoring your channel just in case you do need to transmit a signal
bridge to captain jellico weve arrived at the shuttle departure coordinates
did you launch the probe i requested
yes sir i wasnt aware you wanted to be informed
thank you jellico out i can see why hes still only a first officer
captain i would just like you to know that commander riker is
ive read your reports jeanluc i know you think highly of him
its not just my opinion hes been decorated by starfleet command five times hes been offered his own ship more than once i think if you just gave him a chance youd find him an outstanding officer
jeanluc lets be candid for a moment the cardassians arent going to listen to reason and the federation isnt going to give in to their demands and the chances are you wont be coming back from this mission of yours i want this ship ready for action and i dont have time to give will riker or anyone else a chance and forgive me for being blunt but the enterprise is mine now well heres hoping you beat the odds good hunting
thank you
jeanluc i believe this is yours


shuttlecraft feynman to enterprise we have cleared the shuttlebay
acknowledged feynman good luck
thank you enterprise well now that were under way i can tell you about our mission starfleet intelligence believes the cardassians are developing a metagenic weapon
oh my god
i am not familiar with metagenics
theyre genetically engineered viruses that are designed to destroy entire ecosystems when metagenic toxins are released into a planets atmosphere they immediately begin to mutate they seek out and destroy all forms of dna they encounter in a few days everything is dead
in a month the metagenic agent itself breaks down and dissipates completely leaving every city every road every piece of equipment perfectly intact
leaving the planet safe to be conquered wouldnt using such a weapon pose as great a risk to the attacker as to the target
thats why metagenics and other biological weapons were outlawed years ago even the romulans have abided with those agreements
starfleet intelligence believes that the cardassians are developing a new delivery system one that would protect them from accidental exposure to the toxin they believe that the cardassians are testing a way of launching dormant metagenic material on a subspace carrier wave
so they could activate the toxins after the launch thereby preventing any accidental exposure
and because the subspace wave would appear simply as background radiation no one would realise what was happening until it was too late now for the past few weeks thetaband subspace emissions have been detected coming from celtris three those emissions may indicate that a metagenic delivery system in operation
what do we know about celtris three
very little it was thought to be uninhabited until these emissions were detected starfleet believes that the cardassians may have a secret research lab located somewhere below the planet surface our orders are to penetrate this celtris three installation and determine if the cardassians are actually building a metagenic weapon
and if they are
destroy it at any cost when i was on the stargazer we conducted extensive tests using theta band carrier waves one of the reasons i was selected for this mission is my familiarity with the methods used for generating them mister worf your presence here is obvious doctor your job will be to locate and destroy any biotoxins we may find
celtris three is in cardassian space how will we get there undetected
i know a way of acquiring some discreet transport mister worf set a course for torman five


if he doesnt pay up i know three large ferengi who will not be so forgiving

i didnt do it
im not accusing you of anything
what do you want then
were looking for daimon solok
why
i have a business proposition to discuss
solok is a very busy very important man he isnt here  but i could relay a message
good please will you tell daimon solok that were interested in transportation to celtris three
thats a cardassian planet
now we understand that daimon solok runs cargo there from time to time
solok is no smuggler
yes but if solok were to go to celtris three for legitimate reasons we would be interested in quietly booking passage for the journey
i dont think he would be interested in dealing with federation spies
you know i heard that solok was quite a man
why yes he is an extraordinary man
thats why we came here because only solok could help us i guess theres some things even solok cant do its too bad  because if he could i would be very very
yes
grateful
 when do you want to leave

beverly make sure that your tricorder is keeping a precise map of the route we could very easily get lost in here
right im picking up some subspace signals but i cant seem to get a lock on them
thats typical of thetaband emissions you have to compress the detection band width in order to determine the fix the source emission is five hundred metres east of here and seven hundred metres below

its all right theyre called lynars a kind of celtrine bat theyre harmless
bats
youre not afraid of bats are you worf
of course not
first officers log supplemental we have rendezvoused with the cardassian ship reklar to begin diplomatic talks designed to ease tensions along the border

gul lemec has arrived hes waiting for you in the observation lounge
very good ill be in my ready room


yes
captain i think theres been a slight miscommunication did you want to meet with gul lemec in here
no the observation lounge is appropriate
i see
lemec is a cardassian and cardassians are like timber wolves predators bold in large numbers cautious by themselves and with an instinctive need to establish a dominant position in any social gathering
so youre trying to establish a dominant position by making him wait for you the trouble with wolves is that sometimes the fight for dominance one of them ends up dead
in that case the trick is to be the wolf thats still standing at the end

the floor is over five hundred metres down from here
there doesnt seem to be a way around well have to rappel from here this is sheer granite well have to use fusing pitons
we could try to find another way down
unfortunately that would take several hours we dont have the time
youre not afraid of heights are you doctor
of course not

now remember to control your descent and dont get the lines tangled
ill remember
all right

what is going on i have been waiting here for over an hour
im captain jellico i believe you know commander riker and this is lieutenant commander troi lets get to it shall we
this treatment is a deliberate insult to the cardassian union i have been kept waiting here for over an hour
then im sure youre ready to talk
i did not agree to allow others into this meeting
if it alarms you i can ask them to leave
i am not alarmed but we did not
a great many people are depending on our efforts here gul lemec we dont need to quibble over minutiae
i have here come to negotiate a federation withdrawal from the border not to be dictated to by some mere captain
i can see youre not serious about these talks if the cardassian union truly wishes to discuss peace they can send someone who can negotiate in a civilised manner

captain on the bridge
let him stew for a few minutes then go in and tell him youve convinced me to meet with him one more time tell him im a loose cannon and that he needs to be more reasonable because im such an unreasonable man lemec will want to bring his own aides on board pretend to be worried that ill object and then give grudging permission for two aides no more understood
yes sir
aye sir

well ill say this for him hes sure of himself
no hes not

the installation should be about three hundred metres this way
i dont suppose well be able to find another way to get back up there
i doubt it
thats what i thought


theres a lava tube beyond here that runs for seventy five metres then it connects with another chamber we need to get through here this tube opens up beyond this crack we could widen the opening then we should be able to crawl through mister worf
a phaser set to level sixteen should suffice
make it so

well done mister worf

gul lemec a pleasure
may i present my aides glin corak and glin tajor
welcome aboard for the past three weeks youve been massing troops in staging areas assembling strike forces and pulling ships from their normal patrols we will not stand for this clearly provocative behaviour
i see the federation spy network has again provided you with faulty information we are conducting routine training operations nothing more
then im sure you wont mind if we send a few starships into this sector for our own training operations
your fleet deployments do not concern us however we are very concerned about your refusal to vacate those territories along the border which are clearly cardassian
you gave up your claims on those territories when you signed the armistice you couldnt take those worlds by force so you want us to give them to you at the bargaining table
captain please we should listen to them
gul lemec as you know the systems are still subject to negotiation by the terms of the treaty
negotiations which we have pursued in good faith unfortunately the federation has not been as forthcoming
so to speed up the process you are preparing for war
we are preparing to defend ourselves
the federation will not start a war
that has always been your position however i have heard reports that a small team from the federation has already been sent into our territory of course i dont believe it such an attempt would almost certainly fail and even if it succeeded it would trigger a very serious response on our part
i dont know what youre talking about
then theres no need for worry a short recess would seem to be in order
very well
where is captain picard
reassigned
well i hope his new assignment is not too dangerous it would be a shame if something were to happen to such a er such a noted officer
yes it would

only a few more metres

beverly get out of there beverly

i have her

are you all right
i think so next time you try bring up the rear
were nearly there can you continue


looks like a maintenance hatch to the installation im picking up three proximity sensors around it

sensor echoes established but the false image will only last a few minutes the hatch is magnetically sealed but i believe i can bypass it
i cant get a scan from the other side of the hatch its been shielded
we have no choice remember aim low fire in short controlled bursts
ready
now


theres no one here theres no lab
its a trap come on

captain


lets go
the captain
no there are five more of them heading this way from another tunnel come on now


come on

captain on the bridge
what have you got will
im not sure were picking up a lot of coded messages from a cardassian planet near the border
which planet
celtris three
can you detect any thetaband subspace emissions coming from celtris
there are some residual traces it seems there were emissions up until a few minutes ago
open a secure channel to admiral nechayev priority two put it through to my ready room
aye sir

captain
those emissions you were so concerned about have just stopped id say one way or another our friends have finished their task
have you heard from our friends
no
let me know if you do id very much like to see them again
so would i admiral


a challenge  you should prove to be an interesting challenge possibly the most interesting to come through that door in many years
what do you want
why you of course picard jeanluc serial number sp dash nine three seven dash two one five son of maurice and yvette picard born in la barre france formerly captain of the stargazer where you conducted extensive studies on thetaband subspace carrier waves dont look so surprised how could we have designed a lure for the captain of the federation flagship unless we knew something about his background
so you concocted an elaborate ruse to bring me here why
in this room you do not ask questions i ask them you answer if im not satisfied with those answers you will die
to be continued
chain of command part 

the next generation
you are hereby requested and required to relinquish command of your vessel to captain edward jellico commanding officer uss cairo as of this date
i want this ship ready for action and i dont have time to give will riker or any one else a chance and forgive me for being blunt but the enterprise is mine now

our orders are to penetrate the celtris three installation

its a trap come on
lets go
the captain
no there are five more of them heading this way from another tunnel
you should prove an interesting challenge possibly the most interesting to come through that door in many years
what do you want
why you of course
and now the conclusion


your place of birth
la barre france
mothers name
yvette gessard
hes ready keep the serum at that level what is your current assignment
special operations on celtris three
what is your mission on celtris three
to seek and destroy a metagenic weapon
how many others were part of this mission
two
name and rank
chief medical officer beverly crusher lieutenant worf
what are the federations defence plans for minos korva
i dont know
increase the level slightly to point three one lets begin again shall we name
picard jeanluc
place of birth
la barre france
captains log stardate  the negotiations with the cardassians have made little progress i believe a military confrontation may be unavoidable

gul lemec i assure you that what the federation wants above all is the preservation of peace
then how do you explain the fact that a federation team launched an unprovoked assault on cardassian territory less than fourteen hours ago
i dont know what youre talking about
then let me explain captain jeanluc picard lieutenant worf and doctor beverly crusher landed on celtris three attacked one of our outposts in a brutal assault and killed over fifty five men women and children
what evidence do you have of that
we have all the evidence we need we have captain picard
is he alive
the cardassian union has yet to decided how it will respond to this latest provocation but rest assured we will respond

is there any truth in what hes saying
captain picard and the others were sent to investigate reports of a metagenic weapon on celtris three its possible that they may have been captured but if they did escape theyll head for the lyshan system the enterprise is supposed to meet them there in eight hours will i want you to take a shuttlecraft and head for the rendezvous point the enterprise will have to remain here until the endgame with gul lemec is played out
aye sir


captain picard
i demand to see a neutral representative as required by the federationcardassian peace treaty

we have already sent a message to tohvun three the nearest neutral planet they assure us they will dispatch someone immediately will you allow me to remove your restraints  i understand that you are a student of archaeology did you know that cardassia boasts some of the most ancient and splendid ruins in the entire galaxy
i know that the burial vaults of the first hebitian civilisation are said to be magnificent
apparently when they were first unearthed two hundred years ago they were the burial vaults contained unimaginably beautiful artefacts made of jevonite a rare breathtaking stone but most of those objects are gone
what happened to them
what happens to impoverished societies the tombs were plundered priceless treasures stolen a few were preserved in museums but even those were eventually sold in order to pay for our war efforts
that war cost you hundreds of thousands of lives it depleted your food supplies left your population weakened and miserable and yet you risk another war
lets not waste time arguing about issues we cant resolve would you care to tour the hebitian burial vaults
what i would like is to be returned to my ship
my dear captain you are a criminal you have been apprehended invading one of our secret facilities the least that will happen is for you to stand trial and be punished but i am offering you the opportunity for that experience to be civilised
what is the price of that opportunity
cooperation we need to know the federations defence strategy for minos korva
youve injected me with drugs surely you must realise that ive already answered truthfully every question youve put to me
captain we have gone to great lengths to lure you here because we know that in the event of an invasion the enterprise will be the command ship for the sector encompassing minos korva
then it seems you have more knowledge of the situation than i

wasted energy captain you might come to wish you hadnt expended it in such a futile effort
torture is expressly forbidden by the terms of the seldonis four convention governing treatment of prisoners of war

are you in good health do you have any physical ailments i should know about  beautiful isnt it the stone is jevonite and now you know why it is so highly prized from this point on you will enjoy no privilege of rank no privileges of person from now on i will refer to you only as human you have no other identity

first officers log supplemental i have returned from the rendezvous point in the lyshan system with doctor crusher and lieutenant worf captain picards fate is still unknown

there was no chance to go back for the captain we barely made it back to the ferengi cargo ship ourselves
you were smart not to try
i dont feel so smart
get some rest doctor will

i want geordi to analyse the readings from beverlys tricorder tell him to scrutinize every detail of those caverns on celtris three
aye sir request permission to begin planning a rescue operation
i know you were close to him will but we dont even know if hes still alive under the circumstances a rescue mission would be foolhardy
shouldnt we assume that he is alive until its been proved otherwise we cannot just abandon him
hes gone im sorry will but youre going to have to accept that i want those tricorder readings analysed by fourteen hundred hours
yes sir


good morning i trust you slept well

thirsty i would imagine so well its time to move on
ive told you all that i know
yes im sure you have  how many lights do you see there
i see four lights
no there are five are you quite sure
there are four lights
perhaps youre aware of the incision on your chest while you were under the influence of our drugs you were implanted with a small device its a remarkable invention by entering commands in this padd i can produce pain in any part of your body at various levels of severity forgive me i dont enjoy this but i must demonstrate it will make everything clearer

surprising isnt it most people feel at first that they can steel themselves against it but theyre completely unprepared for the intensity of the pain that was the lowest possible setting
i know nothing about minos korva
but ive told you that i believe you i didnt ask you about minos korva i asked how many lights you see
there are four lights
i dont understand how you can be so mistaken

what is your current assignment
special operations on celtris three
do you have anything to say
captain picard was not acting under my orders
and if we wish to execute him
under the terms of the selonis convention captain picard must
the selonis convention applies to prisoners of war which means you would have to acknowledge that he was captured during a mission authorised by the federation are you willing to make such an admission
no
then he will be treated as a terrorist
its not my concern
there is of course an alternative
im listening
if the federation agreed to a complete and immediate withdrawal from this sector then we would be disposed to release captain picard and forget about this incident
ill have to discuss this with my superiors
of course you have seven hours

what are you going to do
send a message to admiral necheyev i recommend that she reject lemecs proposal and deploy additional starships along the border
what about captain picard

im not suggesting you trade an entire star system for one mans life but youve got to acknowledge that these were federation orders and he is a prisoner of war
no
he will have the protection of the seldonis convention
that would play right into gul lemecs hand hes just waiting for some sign of weakness on our part before he starts making more demands
i cant believe youre willing to sacrifice captain picards life as a negotiating tactic
will captain were all concerned about
are you questioning my judgment commander
as first officer it is my responsibility to point out any actions that may be mistakes by a commanding officer sir
then maybe its time you found other responsibilities youre relieved dont make me confine you to quarters as well
sir


they went to a lot of trouble to lure a federation team to that planet why
it is possible that the cardassians were specifically interested in capturing captain picard
why do you say that
the metagenic weapon they were supposedly developing used a thetaband subspace delivery system captain picard is one of only three starfleet captains with extensive experience in thetaband devices the other two are no longer in starfleet
so they tailored a fake weapon to lure picard but why they mustve known wed change all his access codes and security protocols
maybe they were interested in something that he did in the past something that happened while he was captain of the enterprise
or something he was going to do in the future in case of a cardassian attack the enterprise will be assigned as command ship for this sector if the cardassians got wind of that
they might have assumed captain picard would know those defence plans
if your theory is correct the cardassians may be planning an attack somewhere in this sector
the question is where geordi i want you to conduct a discreet scan of gul lemecs ship look for anything unusual anything that might indicate where theyve been lately
aye sir


i want you to be very careful with your wompat from now on jil orra now that shes separated from her mother she depends on you
i will father do humans have mothers and fathers
yes but human mothers and fathers dont love their children as we do theyre not the same as we are
will you read to me tonight
yes of course i will ill see you later

your daughter is lovely
yes i think so and unusually bright its amazing isnt it the way theyre able to sneak into your heart i must admit i was completely unprepared for the power she had over me from the moment she was born
im surprised that you let her come in here
why
to expose a child to this to someone who is suffering to see that it is you that inflict that suffering
from the time jil orra could crawl shes been taught about the enemies of the cardassians and that enemies deserve their fate
when children learn to devalue others they can devalue anyone including their parents
what a blind narrow view you have what an arrogant man you are what do you know of cardassian history
i know that once you were a peaceful people with a rich spiritual life
and what did peace and spirituality get us people starved by the millions bodies went unburied disease was rampant suffering was unimaginable
since the military took over hundreds of thousands more have died
but we are feeding the people we acquired territory during the wars we developed new resources we initiated a rebuilding programme we have mandated agricultural programmes that is what the military has done for cardassia and because of that my daughter will never worry about going hungry
her belly may be full but her spirit will be empty

shall we begin again how many lights are there
what lights



it looks like they had some minor hull degradation along their warp nacelles the distribution pattern indicates a recent exposure to a molecular dispersion field
where could they have run into a dispersion field
the mcallister c five nebulas just across the border its approximately seven light years from federation space
could there be cardassian ships inside the mcallister nebula
its possible but they wouldnt be able to stay in there for very long the particle flux in the nebula would begin to break down a ships hull just after seventy two hours
is there a federation system near the mcallister nebula that might interest the cardassians
minos korva is only eleven light years from the nebula and the cardassians tried to annex it during the war
data i want to be at minos korva in one hour
aye sir set course three five zero mark two one five and engage at warp eight point five


sur le pont davignon on y danse on y danse
wake up where were you
at home sunday dinner we would all sing afterward
what a charming picture the picard family voices raised in song is this whats keeping you from breaking memories of home and hearth images of happier times i must congratulate you youre remarkably strong willed i see no point in holding you further you may go someone will give you clean clothing before we return you to your ship

we will get what we need from the human female
what female are you referring to
the human who was part of your abortive assault team of course doctor beverly crusher
what have you done to her
not a thing shes quite safe i wanted to finish my interviews with you before i interrogated her i had hoped it might not be necessary
lieutenant worf
he left us few options we had to kill him im more optimistic about getting what we need from the woman
doctor crusher has no knowledge of any of starfleets plans shes a medical officer
you might be right ill have to determine that for myself

are you choosing to stay with me excellent i cant tell you how pleased that makes me

starfleet now believes the cardassians are preparing to invade minos korva im convinced their invasion fleet is hiding in the mcallister nebula i intend to hit them before they leave it
captain what if youre wrong what if the cardassians are in that nebula to conduct scientific research
youd have to have some pretty good evidence to convince me of that
youre still gambling hundreds of lives
this discussion is moot the plan has been approved and we are going ahead mister data by your calculations how long could the cardassian ships stay in the nebula
in seventeen hours their hull degradation will reach dangerous levels they will have to leave before that
all right worf prepare a series of five hundred antimatter mines with magnetic targeting capabilities
aye sir
geordi were going to need a shuttle specially outfitted to operate in the nebula by fourteen hundred hours beverly youll need to
have sickbay ready for the casualties youre about to send me
thats right dismissed


oh youre awake have something to eat i insist boiled taspar egg its a delicacy im happy to share with you

wonderful wonderful i like you human most people become ill at the sight of live taspar i remember the first time i ate a live taspar i was six years old and living on the streets of lakat there was a band of children four five six years old some even smaller desperately trying to survive we were thin scrawny little animals constantly hungry always cold we slept together in doorways like packs of wild gettles for warmth once i found a nest taspars had mated and built a nest in the eave of a burntout building and i found three eggs in it it was like finding treasure i cracked one open on the spot and ate it very much as you just did i planned to save the other two they would keep me alive for another week but of course an older boy saw them and wanted them and he got them but he had to break my arm to do it
must be rewarding to you to repay others for all those years of misery
what do you mean
torture has never been a reliable means of extracting information it is ultimately selfdefeating as a means of control one wonders that its still practiced
i fail to see where this analysis is leading
whenever i look at you now i wont see a powerful cardassian warrior i will see a six year old boy who is powerless to protect himself
be quiet
in spite of all youve done to me i find you a pitiable man
picard stop it or i will turn this on and leave you here in agony all night
ah you called me picard
what are the federations defence plans for minos korva
there are four lights

there are five lights how many do you see now
 you are six years old weak and helpless you cannot hurt me
how many
sur le pont davignon on y danse

how are we doing
were almost done sir ive shielded the engine nacelles and the transporter system so they wont be affected by the particle flux from the nebula
good

been awhile since i flew one of these youre a pilot yourself arent you geordi
yes sir
i began my career as a shuttle pilot on the jovian run jupiter to saturn and back once a day every day
is that right i was on that run myself for a while
then you mustve done titans turn
oh yeah you set a course directly for titan hold it until youre just brushing the atmosphere throw the helm hard over and whip around the moon at point seven c
and pray like hell nobody saw you
you know this trip into the nebulas going to need someone who can do titans turn in their sleep these mines need to be laid within two kilometres of the cardassian ships but the particle flux from the nebula will blind all the sensors except for this proximity detector youre going to need one heck of a pilot to pull that off
is that you
i could do it but truthfully the man you want is commander riker hes the best there is


come in
am i disturbing you
not at all
musician
yes
classical contemporary
jazz
ah
is there something i can do for you captain
are you aware of our plans to attack the cardassian invasion fleet
yes sir i understand youve been talking to every shuttle pilot on board
lets drop the ranks for a moment i dont like you i think youre insubordinate arrogant wilful and i dont think youre a particularly good first officer but you are also the best pilot on the ship
well now that the ranks are dropped captain i dont like you either you are arrogant and closedminded you need to control everything and everyone you dont provide an atmosphere of trust and you dont inspire these people to go out of their way for you youve get everybody wound up so tight theres no joy in anything i dont think youre a particularly good captain
i wont order you to fly this mission im here to ask
then ask me
will you pilot the shuttle commander
yes

youre welcome

weve lost primary navigation switching to secondary systems
inertial dampers compensating
sensors inoperative
right on schedule
the proximity detector is working we should be able to read their ships at a distance of five hundred metres
dont make this too easy

hang on
do i want to know how close that was
no get ready to deploy the mines

captain the shuttlecraft is emerging from the nebula
enterprise to shuttle were you successful commander
aye sir the mines are laid
very well red alert stand by to detonate the mines on my command
standing by
open a channel to the reklar
this is cardassian territory captain your presence here is another deliberate provocation to
im not going to argue with you gul lemec every one of your ships has a mine on its belly my fingers on the button and youre in a very bad position
you cant intimidate us
mister worf set off alpha four two
aye sir

that was just a baby the big boys are sitting on your hull just waiting for me to say the word
what are your terms
your ships will leave the nebula one by one each ship will eject its primary phaser coil before setting course for the nearest cardassian base
but that will leave us defenceless
mister worf prepare to detonate
i will agree to your terms
excellent oh and one more thing i understand youre holding a starfleet officer named jeanluc picard i expect him returned immediately


that wont help i have many more
still it felt good
enjoy your good feelings while you can there may not be many more of them ive just received word theres been a battle the enterprise is burning in space the invasion of minos korva has been successful
i dont believe you
theres no need for any further information from you our troops were successful in spite of your refusal to help me you might have saved yourself a great deal of torment by yielding at the beginning
i want to see neutral representative
there is no such person the word will be that you perished with your crew no one will ever know that you are here with us as you will be for a long long time you do however have a choice you can live out your life in misery held here subject to my whims or you can live in comfort with good food and warm clothing women as you desire them allowed to pursue your studies of philosophy and history i would enjoy debating with you you have a keen mind its up to you a life of ease of reflection and intellectual challenge or this
what must i do
nothing really tell me how many lights you see how many how many lights this is your last chance the guards are coming dont be a stubborn fool how many

you told me he would be ready to go
we had some unfinished business
get him cleaned up a ship is waiting to take him back to the enterprise captain picard if youll go with the guards theyll take care of you
there are four lights


captain on the bridge welcome home jeanluc
thank you
just the way you left it maybe a little better computer transfer all command codes to captain jeanluc picard voice authorisation jellico alpha three one
transfer complete uss enterprise now under command of captain jeanluc picard
i relieve you sir
i stand relieved  its been an honour serving with you

you have the bridge number one
aye sir


i er i dont know where to begin it was
i read your report
what i didnt put in the report was that at the end he gave me a choice between a life of comfort or more torture all i had to do was to say that i could see five lights when in fact there were only four
you didnt say it
no no but i was going to i would have told him anything anything at all but more than that i believed that i could see five lights
ship in a bottle



it was then that i began to suspect that your brother did not die by his own hand that he was in fact murdered
 murdered huh good lord
but holmes the vial of poison found in his hand
that was the first clue watson the vial contained strychnine which as you well know induces violent muscular spasms it is difficult to imagine that someone in the throes of so gruesome a death could have held on to so delicate a container without shattering it
you dont mean
exactly the vial was placed in his hand after he died
then what was the cause of death
the cigar of course
cigar
upon closer inspection of the room where your brother was found i discovered a fresh burn mark on the carpet further analysis of the ash revealed that the cigar was laced with strychnine
this is utter nonsense what about the suicide note it was written in my dear brothers own hand
with practice handwriting can be forged it takes a trained eye to notice certain discrepancies for example whether someone is right or left handed

your brother was right handed the alleged suicide note was written by a left handed individual such as yourself
er data its in his right hand
curious there seems to be a problem in the holodecks spatial orientation systems
londons greatest detective

freeze programme la forge to barclay
barclay here
reg something went wrong with the holodeck programme again
oh im sorry ill look into it right away
thanks reg we should get back to engineering data computer end programme and save

whoa whoa reg
sorry commander im on my way to the holodeck
sherlock holmes programme three a has demonstrated some very curious anomalies
there must have been a glitch in the matrix diodes but ill track it down dont worry
thanks reg see you later


computer run a diagnostic on all sherlock holmes files display any anomalous programming sequences
diagnostic complete all files conform to specified parameters except those contained in protected memory
protected memory display those sequences computer unlock this sequence and run the programme

who are you
professor james moriarty
moriarty oh thats sherlock holmes arch enemy are you left or right handed
left handed would you very much mind telling me

no problem there
where is captain picard is he still captain of this vessel
how would how do you know the captain
you dont know anything about what happened do you i have been stored in memory for god knows how long and no one has given me a second thought

memory refresher if you need it

you know you know what you are
a holodeck character a fictional man yes yes i know all about your marvellous inventions i was created as a plaything so that your commander data could masquerade as sherlock holmes but they made me too well and i became more than a character in a story i became selfaware i am alive
thats not possible
but here i am tell me has a way been found to allow me to leave the confines of this holodeck world
leave the holodeck no of course not you can only exist in here
damn you picard he promised me something would be done i should have realised he would have said anything to get me to release my hostage
hostage
how long have i been locked away
well it l ooks like about four years
it seemed longer
what are you talking about you cant possibly have been aware of the passage of time
but i was brief terrifying periods of consciousness disembodied without substance
i dont see how that could be possible maybe there was a fragmentation of the protected memory circuits
call it what you will all i know is that despite picards promise hes done nothing just left me to go quietly mad
he would not have forgotten his promise the captain would not do that
id like to talk to him
well i can ask
ask him to meet me in the sitting room at baker street that would be far more appropriate
ill have to store you in memory again until i get an answer

captains log stardate  the enterprise has arrived at the detrian system to observe a unique celestial event the collision of two planets

since both planets are gas giants neither possesses a solid surface their atmospheres however will come into contact in approximately seventeen hours nine minutes
if their collision causes a selfsustaining fusion reaction this is what we are likely to see the birth of a new star the enterprise will hold position until the gravitational instability subsides and we can get in for a closer look now i want triple redundancy on all of the sensor arrays well probably never get another chance to see something like this i dont want to miss anything okay
commander youll never believe what happened while i was working on your programme in the holodeck professor moriarty appeared out of nowhere
what
and he wants to talk to the captain

computer begin sherlock holmes programme three a and place us in the drawing room at two twenty one b baker street
programme complete

computer access protected memory and run moriarty programme
professor its good to see you again
if youd missed my company i should think youd have summoned me before now
i want to assure you that weve not forgotten you we spent some time investigating how you became selfaware frankly it still remains a mystery
it is also irrelevant what concerns me is finding a way to leave the holodeck
we have been wrestling with that problem too unfortunately without any success but we have turned our findings over to starfleets most experienced theoretical scientists
and what did your finest minds come up with
unfortunately they have not arrived at a solution either
i see
professor i am concerned to learn that you experienced the passage of time while you were stored in the computer memory i can assure you we had no idea that that would be the case
enough of this i no longer believe anything you say
professor i understand your frustration
do you really when this is over you will walk out of this room to the real world and your own concerns and leave me here trapped in a world i know to be nothing but illusion i cannot bear that i must leave
that is not possible you cannot exist outside this room
are you certain of that
computer exit

although an object appears solid on the holodeck in the real world they have no substance

an object has no life i do
professor you are a computer simulation
i have consciousness conscious beings have will the mind endows them with powers that are not necessarily understood even by you if my will is strong enough perhaps i can exist outside this room perhaps i can walk into your world right now
professor i ask you to believe me if you step out of that door you will cease to exist
if i am nothing more than a computer simulation then very little will have been lost but if i am right mind over matter cogito ergo sum

i think therefore i am

data to security send two officers to holodeck three
how is this possible
it isnt
this contradicts everything we know about holodeck physics
then perhaps you dont know as much as you thought
professor will you come with me id like our doctor to examine you

certainly sir policemen id recognise them in any century

as far as i can tell hes real hes human
what else would i be dear lady
his dna is a little unusual but all the major systems are there and functioning normally
as far as i can tell theres no evidence that his molecules are losing any cohesion they seem to be as immutable as ordinary matter
well professor my crew will continue to investigate but for now it would seem you have accomplished a miracle the question is now that youre here what do we do with you
i ask only that i be allowed to explore this new world your vessel for instance what sea does she sail might we go above deck weather permitting of course
professor i think there are some things of which you should be made aware

my god were adrift in the heavens
no not adrift the enterprise is a starship capable of travelling through space
extraordinary are we far from earth what is the range of this ship what means of locomotion does it use theres so much for me to learn i hardly know where to start
i can give you books that will help
good good i want to start making plans determine what im going to do with my life
i hope you will plan on remaining on board for a while there is still much that we need to understand about what has happened to you
does it really matter the point is im here and im eager to get on with life
professor i feel it necessary to point out that criminal behaviour is as unacceptable in the twenty fourth century as it was in the nineteenth and much harder to get away with
dont worry captain my past is nothing but a fiction the scribblings of an englishman dead now for four centuries i hope to leave his books on the shelf as it were
if thats so then there are opportunities awaiting you that are beyond anything you have ever imagined
your century may welcome me but
what is the matter
in considering all these vast possibilities i suddenly feel very much alone i am a man out of time captain and that isolates me you have been more gracious than i could ever have imagined i wonder may i impose on your generosity once again there is a woman the countess regina bartholomew she was created as a holodeck character for one of commander datas programs she was designed to be the love of my life could she also be brought off the holodeck
professor i ask you to believe me when i say that we do not know how or why you are able to exist off the holodeck
i do i do believe you
according to the laws of physics this is impossible we would have no idea how to do it again
as i understand it i was endowed with consciousness four years ago when someone said to the computer create an opponent with a capacity to outthink data or words to that effect could we not make a similar request on behalf of the countess
even if i had reason to believe that would be successful i dont think that i could sanction it please understand professor that you are in essence a new life form one that we didnt intend to create and that we dont fully understand now the moral and ethical implications of deliberately creating another one like you are overwhelming
is it morally and ethically acceptable to deny the woman i love so that you can put your conscience at ease are you saying that you will simply dictate how i am to live my life
i assure you we will do everything possible to make you comfortable
so long as i accept the terms under which you dole out those comforts captain i am a powerless man you hold my future my happiness my very life in your hands please consider my request

i understand his frustration we created him and we created her to be the woman he loves surely we have some responsibility to them
its very romantic but until we know just what it was that walked off the holodeck i dont think we should be trying it again
even if we decided to do it theres no guarantee that wed be able to
there is also no way of knowing if the professors ability to exist off the holodeck is permanent it may be unwise to consider creating a second individual while this uncertainty exists
agreed we dont have enough information about this phenomenon to act in a responsible way i think well hold off on professor moriartys request for now but continue with your investigation in the meantime i have to deal with professor moriarty

i feel i must postpone action until we learn more
yes you know all about that i stayed in the dungeon of your computer for years waiting for you to learn more it wasnt until i took things into my own hands that something got done
professor i wonder why youre in so much of a hurry is this woman involved with you in some illegal venture
your computer designed her to be a person of impeccable integrity she would never commit a crime
you must love her very much
the programme fashioned her for me to love but i must admit i would have done so anyway she is remarkable my life has not been the same since i met her i dont simply love her captain i adore her
then her safety must be very important to you give us time to determine what is going on happened here that way we can minimise the risks in bringing her to you you wouldnt want to lose her because we acted too quickly
riker to captain picard
picard here
could you join us on the bridge
on my way

there they are captain
how long until they begin to coalesce
within the next five hours sir

mister worf launch four class a probes toward the planets
aye sir
mister worf
i dont understand

controls are not responding
command functions are being rerouted sir
for what reason
unknown sir
computer route all command functions to the bridge
command functions are offline
reinitialise them on my authorisation
authorisation denied
explain
picard command codes are no longer valid
whats happening whos transferred the voice authorisation
i have im afraid i had no choice but to take control of your vessel

if you harm me sir i will not be able to relinquish voice control of your vessel
professor this situation is more serious than you realise in less than five hours those two planets will collide and a new star will form unless we move to a safe distance this vessel will be destroyed
im just a fictional character i havent much to lose
but surely you wish to live like the rest of us
not alone not without the countess
weve discussed that we are studying means of bringing her safely off the holodeck but five hours is not enough time
im not so sure a deadline has a wonderful way of concentrating the mind
mister data will you investigate the possibility of complying with professor moriartys request
aye sir
in the meantime we have a few things to discuss

perhaps we should consider the transporter system it uses many of the same principles as the holodeck both for example are capable of converting energy into matter
except the transporter reconstitutes energy in a permanent form holodeck matter doesnt have any cohesion unless its inside the grid
i wonder what would happen if we tried to beam a holodeck object off the grid
nothing would happen a holodeck object is just a simulation theres nothing there to provide a pattern lock for the transporter
however if it were possible to lock onto the object it might rematerialise with the same molecular cohesion as conventional matter
thats a big leap data i just dont think the transporter is going to accept simulated matter
unless unless we could find a way to compensate for the phase variance if we could modify the pattern enhancers we just might do it
well professor moriarty has agreed not to interfere with routine ship operations so long as he believes were acting in good faith then i dont think were in immediate danger any progress
we were just talking about using the transporter to beam the countess off the holodeck but i dont quite see how its going to work
well keep at it i have to tell him that we are making some progress mister la forge do you have any idea how moriarty could have gained control of the ship
somehow he managed to override the security lockouts and rewrite them the man is brilliant in any century
i want you to find some way to undo what he has done so that we can regain control of this ship

set the pattern enhancers around whatever object you wish to transport i will proceed to the transporter room and begin modifications
computer run sherlock holmes programme three a
that programme is already in use


are you here to see mister holmes or perhaps professor moriarty neither is in just now
um er no no no im not here to see anyone im just here to deliver these
fine just put them anywhere
actually i have to put them right here
how curious why is that
well it has to do with er its nothing you need to worry about countess
are you suggesting that its beyond my comprehension
its really very simple i need to enhance the molecular pattern of this chair so that the transporter can get a better lock on the signal
this has to do with taking james and me into the real world
you you you know about that you understand about the real world
james has explained it to me it sounds like a grand adventure theres nothing i love more than voyaging in the unknown have you ever been to africa mister
er barclay lieutenant reginald barclay no no i havent
i have when i was seventeen i went on safari with my uncle my mother took to her bed in terror id be bitten by tsetse fly but i had a marvellous time i got to wear trousers the whole time it was hard to go back to a corset i can tell you
yes im sure it was
after that i never stopped travelling i couldnt bear to be stuck in one place for very long so you see im so looking forward to this new experience my travelling the stars
you know about that you know where we are countess forgive me but you just dont sound like a holodeck character
thats because she isnt
james

if you loved a woman like this lieutenant would you be content to let her remain a simulation
you you gave her consciousness
yes just as it was given to me
well im not so sure thats a good idea
nonsense it was the only thing to do
have you tried to take her off the holodeck yet
no i am unwilling to risk the countess safety i want to make sure nothing will happen to her
we may be closer to freedom than you think james these devices will enhance our molecular patterns theyll help take us into the real world
oh please proceed
well were going to try to transport this chair off the holodeck first we didnt want to try it on the countess until we were sure it would work
how thoughtful isnt he thoughtful james
barclay to commander data

go ahead lieutenant
im ready here
modifications are complete

stand by
standing by

activating pattern enhancers energising i am having difficulty establishing a pattern lock  boost the confinement beam please pattern lock established

energising

oh bravo
do you have the chair commander

no it lost its cohesion as soon as the transporter cycle was complete

well it was a long shot to begin with
agreed however we may be able to learn something from the attempt

computer display the transport logs for the sequence just completed  computer what is being displayed here
transport log seven five nine
that is the correct log however no information

is being presented
well thats impossible
it is almost as if

our attempt to transport the chair never occurred

you wanted to see me
yes captain i think ive found a way to reinstate your vocal authorisations give it a try
computer route all command functions to this location
command functions are offline
reinitialise them on my authorisation
please input command codes
picard epsilon seven nine three
command codes verified
thats it that should do it wait a minute it didnt work the computer wont release the command pathways
geordi

why did you do that data
captain i have determined how moriarty was able to leave the holodeck he never did neither did we none of this is real it is a simulation we are still on the holodeck
were still on the holodeck
how do you know that
through deduction sir lieutenant barclay and i tried to transport a simulated object off the holodeck something that has never been attempted since the transporter itself is a simulation the computer had no real data from which to create the transport logs
maybe it was just a malfunction in the transporter
then i saw you working the padd with your left hand commander la forge is right handed sir a similar malfunction occurred in the sherlock holmes programme i was running before moriarty first appeared
mister data if what you say is true then this is not geordi la forge are you certain

computer discontinue programme computer exit
moriarty appears to have programmed the holodeck to accept only his commands
picard to bridge
riker here
number one what is my present location
engineering is something wrong sir
no thank you picard out our comm badges must be locked into the simulation if that had been the real commander riker he would have given my location as holodeck three mister la forge will you excuse us please

mister data who is real here
you and i are real sir as is lieutenant barclay we entered the holodeck together when we first went to see moriarty
and from that point we have been existing in a holodeck simulation created by professor moriarty
i believe that is the case sir
i have just given the computer my command codes thinking i would get control of the ship
you may have inadvertently given professor moriarty the means of gaining control of the real enterprise
since professor moriarty never actually left the holodeck he may demand that commander riker help him to do so how long until the planetary collision
less than three hours
so long as moriarty has control of the ship we are vulnerable somehow i have to find a way of giving him what he wants

where is captain picard what have you done with lieutenant barclay and commander data
theyre safe for now
release control of this ship
im afraid i cant do that
what do you want
i only want what you have the luxury of taking for granted freedom i want to leave this holodeck
i think you know thats impossible
your crewmates here in my little ship in a bottle seem a bit more optimistic
oh
they attempted to use your transporter device to remove a simulated object from the holodeck
if they tried it they must have thought they were on to something
their attempt was futile because their transporter was a facsimile i expect more from you
just because our transporter is real doesnt mean its going to work
i sense a distressing lack of enthusiasm on your parts
sir warp core temperature is rising approaching critical levels
i have nothing to lose commander
mister la forge start working on the problem
aye sir
core temperature dropping

computer resume programme

hello have we met
captain jeanluc picard
james has told me all about you i am regina countess bartholomew do sit down may i offer you some tea captain
thank you no ive come here to prevail upon your intelligence and your insight
but not apparently my humility
credit where credit is due madam i can see you are a woman not only of breeding but of wit and sagacity
and you sir are a man of charm and guile you remind me of viscount oglethorpe he was a man could bewitch any woman who breathed
and do you suspect that that is my intent
i cannot be certain of your intent but i am certain that youre the kind of man who usually gets exactly what he wants
what does a woman like you see in a man like moriarty
hes an exciting man captain hes brilliant incisive hes ruthless he has an almost irresistible appeal
hes also an archcriminal
only because he was written like that i see him entirely differently captain he is not a villain
so its your desire to leave the holodeck to be with him
more than anything can you help us
yes i can we have learned that if we uncouple the transporters heisenberg compensators and allow them to rescramble randomly we can beam a holodeck object or a person off the grid with all of the cohesion of conventional matter
oh oh thats splendid i must tell james
no please wait i have brought you this information because i think you are someone who will listen to a reasonable proposition someone whose mind is open to compromise
yes
my ship is in danger it is imperative that i regain navigational control i want you to persuade professor moriarty to return the voice command to me or i will not modify the transporter
i see
now once i have regained voice command i will transport you from the holodeck
forgive me captain but that does sound more like a threat than a compromise
countess you must understand that i am responsible for more than one thousand lives
i will do what i can


the gravity well is beginning to intensify
are we far enough away to keep from being pulled in
its too soon to tell
riker to lieutenant worf
worf here sir
how are you doing

there are force fields blocking our access to the holodeck it will take time to disable them
keep trying
aye sir

think my dear youre certain he said they had to uncouple the heisenberg compensators
yes james im quite certain but he wont do it unless you return control of the ship to him
i have them running around like rats in a maze
what harm would there be in accepting his proposition
my dear you are as brilliant as you are beautiful nonetheless there are things you do not understand now please you must let me handle this computer arch moriarty to commander riker
riker here
commander riker a pleasure as always
i dont have time for games moriarty this ship is falling into a gravity well itll be destroyed within twenty five minutes holodeck and all
then im sure youll be motivated to listen to me very very carefully i want to talk to you about uncoupling the heisenberg compensators

james when we go leave here where exactly are we going
everywhere my darling there are more worlds in the heavens than there are grains of sand on a shoreline
i wish i could take my books i will be so lost without them
ill get you more dont worry i promise you youll want for nothing
riker to moriarty
its time yes commander
were ready
as are we
step inside the transport area
were ready here
activating pattern enhancers energising

welcome aboard
may i present regina the countess bartholomew
countess
commander
youll forgive me if i skip the formalities given the circumstances
ah yes i expect you want me to relinquish my hold on your vessel
please
im afraid that wont be possible just yet
we had an agreement
and i intend to honour it i have no desire to see your vessel destroyed just give me one of your shuttlecraft and allow us to leave in peace
we dont have time for this you release the command codes and well talk
i will not release your vessel until i am looking at it through a shuttlecraft window

everything has been programmed to operate on voice command you just tell the computer where you want to go
excellent
i suggest you head for meles two its the nearest inhabited planet the people are friendly where you go from there is your business
please tell your captain im sorry i couldnt say goodbye i do wish i could see his face when he realises where hes been the last several hours
every second we waste puts us in that much more danger
dont worry commander youll soon have control of your ship
goodbye commander thank you for everything
computer prepare to depart
open shuttlebay doors


this is so beautiful
indeed my dear it is a wondrous sight the first of many we are sure to encounter in our travels computer interface with the central computer on the enterprise
interface complete
release command function lockouts authorisation moriarty alpha two four one five nine
james
yes my love
can we go back to earth some day
of course my dear of course

computer store programme picard delta one in active memory and discontinue simulation


programme stored

well it worked they believed they were off the holodeck
did moriarty release the voice commands captain
lets find out computer discontinue holodeck simulation created by professor moriarty


so far so good this should be the holodeck on the real enterprise
picard to bridge
captain are you all right
yes we are number one what is your status

our systems came back online a few minutes ago
and the planetary collision
were pulling back to a safe distance

well join you shortly
captain
mister worf everything is all right


how did you do it sir
we managed to programme the holodeck inside the holodeck and use the same ruse that moriarty used on us
when he was attempting to contact the real bridge he was in fact speaking to a simulation
you mean he never knew he hadnt left the holodeck
in fact the programme is continuing even now inside that cube
a miniature holodeck
in a way doctor however there is no physicality the programme is continuous but only within the computers circuitry
as far as moriarty and the countess know theyre half way to meles two by now this enhancement module contains enough active memory to provide them experiences for a lifetime
they will live their lives and never know any difference
in a sense you did give moriarty what he wanted
in a sense but who knows our reality may be very much like theirs all this might be just be an elaborate simulation running inside a little device sitting on someones table well we have a newborn star to study mister barclay you will keep that safe
aye sir

computer end programme
aquiel

captains log stardate  we have arrived at a communication relay station near the klingon border where we are scheduled to deliver supplies however the station has not responded to repeated hails


whats that noise
they mustve left an audio monitoring system on were hearing a few thousand subspace messages ill try and shut it off got it

geordi whats that
i dont know sounds like a loose panel or something i think its coming from this service duct over here

heres your loose panel

hey pooch hey pooch come on out of there come on come on hey pooch what are you doing in there
commander the shuttlecraft is gone there is no one on board
commander
what is it
cellular residue i believe these are the remains of one of our lieutenants

all of the blood traces i found match those of lieutenant aquiel uhnari ill assume those are her remains but ill need to take the deck plate back to sickbay just to be sure
it would take a powerful weapon to do that
ill have a better idea once ive analysed the deck plate
if that is uhnari wheres rocha
the stations shuttles gone maybe he took it
before uhnari died or after
were ready commander
did you have any luck downloading the station logs
not yet i cant get past these security lockouts and i think i know why all encrypted subspace messages are sent through this channel take a look at this signal notation
its out of sequence
looks like somebody tried to by pass the access protocols and break into the coded messages it caused the security lockouts to freeze right up
are there any messages missing
i wont know until i get into the files
looks like youve made a friend
yeah
were going to back to the ship let me know as soon as you have something
im going to try accessing the logs from another console



whats going on here well we can start with repolarising the interface

what is it pup whats the matter something over here  this doesnt look like it belongs to you ah this what you want huh  there you go computer run station logs in sequence
station log stardate  today we configured the relay controller grid it was the last primary system we had to overhaul we are scheduled to recalibrate and align the antennae systems in the next three days
computer access visual output
sent in my third request for a message delay buffer until it arrives lieutenant rocha and i have rigged a memory module to compensate it better work or about a half million subspace messages are going to end up drifting through space computer open uhnari correspondence file
computer access correspondence files lieutenant aquiel uhnari
hello shiana sorry i havent talked to you in a while but ive been dealing with the new lieutenant rocha so far hes been rude arrogant and condescending and hes only been here two days this might be a long year
come on lieutenant stick with me
i had the dream again mothers calling out my name shes somewhere in the house i get to the top of the hill all right but then the house is slanted im still walking uphill i cant find her doors everywhere and they all look the same

the cellular residue is completely fused with to metal of the deck plate were trying to microvaporise the metal in order to get a clear dna sample
do you have any idea what killed her
well this is just a guess but from the molecular deposition on the plating id say it was a highlevel phaser blast
could it have been a klingon disruptor
possibly
geordis found evidence that the encrypted messages have been tampered with and we are close to klingon space
there hasnt been a klingon raid against the federation for more than seven years we cant risk a diplomatic incident until we have more evidence
and theres still the question of what happened to lieutenant rocha
get rochas personnel file from starfleet command and ask starbase two twelve to help us find that shuttle
aye sir
keep me apprised doctor


all right lets try this again come on this should be working the phase inducters are aligned come on lieutenant i know youre in here somewhere computer me run a subsystem diagnostic with a frequency range of ten to one hundred megahertz
diagnostic cycle will be complete in twenty seconds
iced coffee

what is it girl

hello shiana by the time you get this the batarael will be over this is the first time i havent been there ive been wondering whos singing the horath in my place  jomiael hahnalia ma marou nitalia rumael tavariel fatra di va jomiael  i had that dream again the one where mother is screaming i climb the hill to our house but i cant get to her shiana this time i ran away i was so scared i ran back down the hill i think i know why ive been having the dreams about danger its because of whats been happening with that klingon hes getting more aggressive all the time not just the usual threat

its because of whats been happening with that klingon hes getting more aggressive all the time not just the usual threat morag actually locked his disruptors to the station this time i dont think therell be any trouble it just brings up those feelings of panic of wanting to run wanting to get away from danger shiana i couldnt say this to anyone but you but the panic its the same thing i used to feel whenever father got angry when i knew he was going to punish me only now im out here in space and theres no place to run

there are three references to a commander morag a klingon officer who patrols this section of the border apparently he would pass the station every few days and harass them
perhaps this morag was the one who was interested in obtaining the encrypted messages
could be she didnt say but i do have several more days of logs left to watch im hoping to learn more
very well in the meantime ill speak with the klingon governor about commander morag

are you saying we attacked your outpost
im merely saying that im following up on evidence that my officers discovered on board
evidence so you are making an accusation the klingon empire will not stand for these kinds of lies
governor torak i apologise i can see that you honestly didnt know what happened aboard the station i will just have to take this matter up with gowron im really sorry that we bothered you
gowron wont bother with such a minor incident
well ordinarily he wouldnt but of course i was his arbiter of succession im sure that he will be happy to come here and investigate this matter you neednt worry about it any longer
gowron will come here
oh yes so once again thank you for your help oh i will be sure to mention your name to gowron when i speak to him
i will investigate this further picard you need not bother gowron with this matter
thats very kind qapla

shiana you always said id look great with a wig so here it is what do you think
definitely not you
 okay maybe im getting a little crazy you would too if you were stuck on a relay station in the middle of nowhere with no one for company except an egomaniac like keith rocha i took a big risk today i countermanded an order he gave i agreed to handle the comm traffic for relay station one nine four while they shut down for maintenance rocha said we couldnt handle the additional signal load but i think hes wrong when he finds out hell be furious its days like this i wish i was home you know what i miss most muskan seed punch real muskan seed punch you can get it from the replicator but its not the same id give anything for some of the punch mother used to make with chunks of the seeds still in it  keith is that you keith 

commander there are dna traces here klingon
so klingons did board the station
yes but i only found dna from one klingon so far i will continue to scan


how could she read this stuff
hows it going
ive managed to access all of lieutenant uhnaris logs im still looking for lieutenant rochas whatever happened to the encrypted messages had a cascade effect on the whole storage system i cant find his files anywhere im running a level three diagnostic now
maybe rocha didnt make the official logs uhnari could have been responsible for them
i dont think so aquiel was the junior officer here
aquiel
lieutenant uhnari ive been up all night watching her personal logs i guess im starting to feel like i know her
what was she like
well she was hahliian she had one sister named shiana she drank muskan seed punch she had a quirky sense of humour she liked to sing she had questionable taste in literature
enterprise to commander riker
riker here
the klingon ship quvat has arrived with governor torak please report to the observation lounge
were on our way

governor torak sir
governor welcome aboard
do not bore me with your human pleasantries i told you we did not kill the woman now i will prove it to you ghos

this is lieutenant aquiel uhnari

we were running a level two diagnostic of the message buffer nothing special rocha had been on edge all morning but hed been irritable ever since he got there so i didnt think anything of it we were halfway through the procedure when suddenly he attacked me he grabbed me threw me against a bulkhead i yelled at him to stop but he wouldnt listen he took me by the throat i broke free and tried to get to the weapons locker im not sure what happened next but somehow i got aboard the shuttle and left
we found her on our side of the border heading toward sector two five two zero she is lucky my patrol ship did not destroy her vessel on sight
lieutenant why didnt you contact starfleet let them know what happened on board the station
i dont know sir maybe i passed out im not even sure how long i was in the shuttle before the klingons picked me up
forty six hours youve been gone forty six hours
we presumed you were dead your blood stains were found at the murder scene
i must have cut my head when he pushed me against the bulkhead
then the remains we found must be those of lieutenant rocha
i cant confirm that until were able to separate the cellular residue from the deck plate i wont be able to do a clear dna scan
you said you were trying to get to the weapons locker is there a possibility that you did
no i didnt
youre sure
i dont remember exactly what happened to me after i was attacked im sorry its as if all my memories were drained out of me
your logs said that a commander morag had been harassing you did you let him or any other klingon aboard the station
absolutely not
if that is true then morag or some other klingon must have boarded the station after she left we found traces of klingon dna on the station
you still try to blame us
have the courage to admit your mistakes or are you a lobe vos
at least i do not wear the uniform of the ptak
governor we are merely exploring all the possibilities lieutenant uhnaris logs reported that commander morag had been harassing the station
he was doing his job
if he was only doing his job then im sure you wont mind if we spoke with him
very well in the interests of diplomacy i will allow you to speak to morag but my patience has limits

lieutenant i know a friend of yours whos very eager to see you
who
come with me

ma
face of the enemy



computer lights computer turn on the lights

good youre awake
who are you
please counsellor there is little time the commander will be calling for you at any moment
where am i
you are aboard the imperial romulan warbird khazara i am subcommander nvek
warbird i was at the neuropsychology seminar at bokara six the last thing i remember was returning to my quarters i was attacked i felt a hypospray
it was necessary i could not be certain you would come voluntarily
oh god my heads still spinning
there are drugs in your system but theyve nearly dissipated the disorientation will soon pass
why have you brought me here
listen to me carefully you are no longer deanna troi you are major rakal of the tal shiar the imperial intelligence commander toreth
am i a prisoner
there is no time to explain everything you must listen commander toreth will want to know your mission tell her nothing simply instruct her to proceed to the kaleb sector heading one oh two mark four
the kaleb sector
repeat it heading one oh two mark four
heading one oh two mark four and shell take orders from me
you are an officer of the tal shiar she will obey you but do not push her too far
sub commander nvek we are approaching the loading point bring our guest to the bridge
yes commander immediately please we must hurry
im not going anywhere until you tell me whats going on
you are a starfleet officer disguised as a romulan unless you trust me and do exactly as i have said toreth will discover you and you will be killed
how do i know i wont be killed anyway
your only chance to get off this ship alive is to do as i say you are an empath you would know if i am lying am i
no
then let us go see the commander

orbit established commander
commence loading the cargo notify me when the transfer is complete

yes sir

commander may i present major rakal of the tal shiar this is commander toreth
attend to your station why are you here without your guards well
the mission is one of utmost secrecy i could not risk bringing guards
and exactly what is the nature of this clandestine assignment
i cannot reveal that
oh why not
i am under orders
you dont act like a member of the tal shiar how long have you been with intelligence
several months
ah
commander cargo is on board and secure
tell me is there a reason why the commander of a ship is being kept ignorant of its cargo
i dont know what you mean
i have been ordered to take on cargo but its contents are unknown to me does that seem wise i am responsible for the safety of this ship and its crew how do i know this cargo is safe to transport
im sure it is safe otherwise it would not have been loaded
ah the tal shiar is deeply concerned for the safety and wellbeing of the military im sure that every person on the bridge of this ship could offer testimony about personal experiences with the tal shiar but i doubt that many could recall those encounters as tender and caring so i must ask you to forgive me major if i hesitate to accept your assurances that that cargo presents no danger to my crew i intend to open those containers
that cargo is the property of the tal shiar you will not touch it
on whose authority
mine and if you do not wish to undergo another personal experience with the tal shiar i suggest you not question me again now proceed on course bearing one oh two mark four to the kaleb sector
why should we go to the kaleb sector its virtually deserted
because those are your orders
pilot set course bearing one oh two mark four warp six
yes commander
captains log stardate  we have arrived at research station seventy five to take on a rather unique passenger one whose homecoming will undoubtedly be difficult

the man acted dishonourably he is a traitor
he risked his life to get here he spent two weeks alone in a scout ship
that does not excuse his original actions

well maybe he finally realised he made a mistake
its twenty years too late energise

ensign deseve by order of starfleet command i am placing you under arrest for treason
i understand
after doctor crusher declares you medically fit you will be confined to your quarters until a court martial can be convened find some civilian clothes i dont want to see you in that uniform
yes sir commander i must speak with captain picard
hes a busy man
please its important urgent
ill tell him

commander
at ease its captain actually
of course im sorry sir
you said it was important that i see you
yes captain i have a message from ambassador spock he said it involves further cowboy diplomacy he said you would understand theres a corvallen freighter arriving in the kaleb sector in the next twelve hours spock wants you to rendezvous with that ship bring its cargo back to federation space
what kind of cargo
he said it was important to the future of the romulans and the federation
you have returned in order to give me this message
partly
in order to know whether ambassador spocks message is being delivered accurately i need to understand something about the messenger
i was ready to come back romulus had lost its appeal
yet at one time you found something very appealing about it
the romulans are very moral captain they have an absolute certainty about what is right and what is wrong who is a friend and who is an enemy a strict moral compass which provides them with a clarity of purpose at one time i found their sense of purpose their passion and commitment to be very compelling
but not any more
as ive grown older i realise that clarity of purpose is a more ambiguous matter than i had thought in my youth
commander riker set course for the kaleb sector warp factor eight
ayeaye sir


you may wait outside make certain were not disturbed

theyre terrified of me
the purpose of the tal shiar is to ensure loyalty to defy them is to invite imprisonment or death
i think its time you told me what this is all about
that is why i called you here these are the cargo containers we brought on board earlier
whats in it

hes alive in stasis who is it
vice proconsul mret of the imperial senate and his two top aides
mret hes one of the highest ranking members of the romulan government
his defection will be a profound blow to romulus
why is he doing this
mret had questioned the repressive activities of the government and was in danger of being imprisoned he is willing to take this risk in order to protest romulan policy and support the dissident movement
youre part of ambassador spocks underground movement
yes if we are able to deliver mret safely spock is hopeful that we can establish an escape route for the thousands of dissidents who live in fear of their lives now you realise why we are willing to go to such extraordinary lengths even kidnapping you to make sure we succeed
youve given me the identity of a tal shiar officer is there a real major rakal
there was she was killed so that you could take her place only a member of the tal shiar would have the authority to alter a ships mission
why me you could have found a romulan to play this role
yes for the first part of the plan but if anything goes wrong we will need a starfleet officer
why
theres no need to go into that unless it becomes necessary for your own sake counsellor the less you know about the specifics of this plan the better
what is your plan
when we reach the kaleb sector we will rendezvous with a corvallen freighter you will take these containers into their ship and accompany them back to starfleet headquarters
the corvallens are mercenaries do they know whats in these containers
no they were hired simply to take you to federation space
very well
we are due in the ward room shortly the senior officers always dine together
ill go to my quarters i think it would be best if i stayed out of the way of the commander
no you will be expected to attend ill go ahead follow me after a few moments commander toreth must not feel that anything is unusual

wed been told that the klingon outpost was undefended so when their warships decloaked they took us completely by surprise

the klingons managed to destroyed half my squadron before we even opened fire but when we did ha they were no match for us i destroyed their flagship myself i received the sotaric citation for my actions that day the intelligence officer in charge of that mission was executed major welcome to our table
commander
i suggest you try the viinerine its quite good

i realise that its nothing compared to what youre accustomed to on romulus but you could at least try the viinerine
ive smelled better viinerine on prison ships
no doubt tell me major where did you train the intelligence academy or the imperial war college
the academy
oh so you must know commander konsab
i know of him
i assume you studied military history with him
yes
tell me major what do you think about his theories on the differences between the military and the tal shiar
which aspects are you referring to
come now major surely you attended his classes regularly it was konsabs main theme
do you have a point to make commander if so it has escaped me
commander konsab believes that in order to function military officers have to trust each other the tal shiar on the other hand trust no one they expect deception so they always find it
your opinion of the tal shiar quite clear commander
i hope so
we ensure the loyalty of the people do you believe the empire would be better off without our protection
protection from what how was the empire threatened by the words of an old man a devoted citizen who merely tried to speak his mind how did the tal shiar protect the empire by dragging him my father out of his home in the middle of the night
clearly your father was a traitor
no he was just an idealistic old man i never saw him again
i dont need your devotion commander just your obedience
and thats all you have
commander sensors are picking up an unidentified ship on an intercept course

what is the configuration
it appears to be a freighter commander
hail them
visual
commander we are glad to see you we are prepared to transfer your cargo as agreed
with whom do you have this agreement
our arrangements were made with major rakal you may rest assured your cargo will be taken safely to its destination we will transmit coordinates for you to beam it aboard
 hes lying they have no intention of keeping their word
are you certain
yes

why did you destroy that vessel
i beg forgiveness commander but major rakal ordered me to fire
the corvallen freighter has been completely destroyed commander there are no survivors
i demand an explanation
how many people were on that ship
approximately eighteen people sir
i dont care if there were eighteen or eight hundred on this ship i give the command to fire major you have no right
 this gives me the right
even you eventually will have to answer to someone you will be held accountable
i have been given broad discretionary powers subcommander nvek acted under my authority the authority of the tal shiar i assure you this action will not be questioned
i will nonetheless make an entry in my log that i am not responsible for those eighteen lives and that i deplore their loss
do what you feel is necessary in the meantime we must protect ourselves engage the cloaking device

and what are my orders now major
hold position and wait

there is no sign of the freighter sir we are the only ship in the area
ensign verify our position
were holding at the coordinates specified by ensign deseve sir
anything on long range sensors
sensors indicate no other ships within three light years
could this have been a hoax
its one possibility mister worf bring ensign deseve to my ready room
aye sir

ensign deseve you promised me a freighter with an important cargo the only thing here is empty space do you have an explanation
i dont understand
captain he has deceived us
no i was told the ship would be at these coordinates
you said that the message came directly from ambassador spock
yes well not exactly
what does that mean
someone else relayed the message to me but he said spock spoke directly to him i trust the man who spoke to me he would not have lied
was he a romulan
yes hes a member of the underground a dissident he risks his life to work with those who want a different future for romulus
captain he could be leading us into a trap
no that is not so
it would be risky to set a trap here so close to federation space but the fact remains here we are there is no freighter did your contact tell you anything else that might be helpful
the freighter is an old antares class vessel with limited speed and range it couldnt have taken on its cargo more than a day ago which means it must be within fifteen light years of here
why didnt you mention this earlier
it didnt seem necessary and on romulus you learn not to volunteer information its a hard habit to break
well maybe now would be a good time to start follow me gentlemen


our plan has collapsed
our plan what about the people on that freighter why did you fire
there was no alternative you told me they couldnt be trusted if i let them live the whole mission would be in jeopardy
eighteen people lost their lives
dont lecture me counsellor a number of people have died in order to carry out this mission believe me those eighteen wont be the last
im sorry but i cant dismiss those lives so easily
fine agonise all you want but dont let it get in the way of our plan
you dont have a plan anymore
you remember i told you if anything went wrong we would need a starfleet officer there is a starfleet base on draken four it is two days away at maximum warp thats where were going
in a romulan ship
yes its your job to order toreth to proceed into federation territory
well never get through the gravitic sensor nets
we will if you provide the correct access codes
do you really think this has a chance of succeeding
if you have another idea ill be happy to consider it

you will plot a course for the draken system
you cant be serious
draken four was the freighters destination i ordered the freighter destroyed because i recognised the captain a known federation spy now we must deliver the cargo ourselves
we must
i do not intend to explain myself to you you will set a course
in order to reach draken we will have to travel through federation space for nearly twenty hours
that is not a problem
contrary to the propaganda that your superiors would have us believe starfleet is neither weak nor foolish the chances of us reaching draken undetected are not good
we will be cloaked
the cloaking device does not always make us invulnerable and you would know that if you had spent any time at all in the field the federation has littered its borders with subspace listening posts with gravitic sensors they may even have a tachyon detection grid in operation in which case they will know that were there if we are discovered in federation territory it will be interpreted as an act of war
the tal shiar has obtained access codes for the sensor nets i will provide them if necessary
that will be no guarantee that we will escape undetected
your cowardice does not befit a romulan soldier
people blame the military for the wars that we are asked to fight but i think it is your kind major that will be the death of us all

plot a course for the draken system
course plotted sir
prepare for warp
commander sensors are picking up a vessel our cloaking device is still engaged they have not detected us
activate viewscreen enlarge
it is the enterprise commander
well major it appears your suspicions about that freighter were correct after all the federation has come in search of its spies status
they are scanning the debris of the freighter shield levels are normal weapon systems are not active they are not prepared for battle sir
they werent expecting to find us here and i see no reason to alter that perception the radiation from the debris field could make our cloak detectable if we engage warp engines proceed at manoeuvring speed
one moment commander we should hold our position until the enterprise has left the area we cannot risk detection
even if we are detected they cannot track us once we go to warp
we have not established their intentions
their intentions are obvious major and are of no concern to us proceed on course manoeuvring engines only go to warp when were clear of the debris field
yes commander we should clear the field in twenty seven minutes
you will keep me informed of our progress

it is not wise to challenge the tal shiar commander
i will not let her tell me how to run my ship

it appears to be the remains of a ship my analysis indicates that it was an antares class freighter
thats the ship we were supposed to meet
could there have had some sort of malfunction a reactor core breach
i do not believe so sir that would not be consistent with the debris pattern however sensors indicate extremely high levels of residual antiprotons
romulan disruptor fire
correct based on the antiproton decay i would estimate the incident occurred within the last four point three hours
then the romulans could still be in the vicinity
red alert shields at maximum
whatever that freighter was carrying they certainly didnt want it to reach us are you sure you dont know what it was
no sir i swear it
all we have here are questions mister data continue with your scan

we have to get a message to the enterprise
thats impossible
its the perfect opportunity the enterprise is nearby if we can communicate with them they might be able to help us
counsellor this ship is travelling under cloak all of our electromagnetic emissions are being monitored any attempt at communication whatsoever and we would be discovered instantly it could not succeed we must continue to draken four that is the safest course
is there anything you can do to the ship or to the cloaking device that would let the enterprise track us
track us no we want to get into federation territory undetected
what we want is to get the dissidents to safety now answer the question is there a way
if there were i wouldnt do it
yes you will
counsellor
were not playing it your way any more nvek ive been kidnapped surgically altered put in danger ive gone along with all your plans now you are going to listen to me you find a way to let the enterprise track us or i will go to toreth and tell her ive discovered youre a traitor ill order you ejected into space is that clear subcommander
there is one possibility in order for a ship to remain undetectable while cloaked the radiative emissions from the warp engines must be precisely balanced the ships engineer is a sympathiser he may be able to slightly misalign one of the nullifier cores it would create a small magnetic disturbance in space whenever we were in motion
good do it
the effect would only be intermittently they might not even detect it
if its the best we can do we have to try it
anything more would be immediately registered on the bridge even this slight misalignment may be detected
its a risk we have to take youre the one who outlined the stakes to me nvek are you getting squeamish now just because things are getting a little more dangerous

sensors are picking up a polarised magnetic distortion to our port side
analysis
the distortion is extremely weak sir it appears to be moving slowly it is gone sir
gone
the distortion no longer registers on our instruments
could this distortion be caused by a cloaked ship
unknown sir our understanding of romulan technology is still limited
captain romulan ships use a forced quantum singularity as a power source if that system is not functioning perfectly or is damaged even slightly it might show through the cloak as a magnetic disturbance of some kind
the distortion has reappeared sir bearing three three seven mark ten it has disappeared again sir
mister deseve in your opinion is it possible that were picking up a cloaked romulan ship
its a strong possibility sir
mister data continue your scan ensign link navigational control to mister datas console and plot a course for that distortion

commander the enterprise is underway
good what is their course
theyre heading for us sir
what
they appear to be on an intercept course
what is the status of our cloaking device is there a malfunction of any kind
cloaking device functioning correctly sir all shipboard emissions within normal range
maintain full sensor scans
commander the enterprise may simply be engaged in search operations
perhaps

where is it now mister data
it has disappeared once again sir i believe it may have been coming to a halt
stop engines
aye sir
if this is a romulan ship will it stay in position until we leave
i dont think so sir a romulan commanders instinct would be to attack

engage manoeuvring engines forward zero point one take us directly under their hull
yes commander
what are you doing
it seems that the enterprise can track us even though we are cloaked i intend to find out whether they can or cannot nvek ready attack procedure
sir disruptors are standing by ready to disengage cloak
we cannot risk an engagement here
considering the nature of our mission i would have preferred to have avoided it as well but i see no other alternative
what do you intend to do
we will pass as close as we possibly can if they do have the ability to track us they will move to avoid a collision if they do i will destroy them

sir the magnetic distortion has reappeared
bearing and speed
it appears to be moving toward us closing slowly its bearing indicates a possible collision course
time to impact
i am unable to make a precise measurement however i would estimate impact within ninety seconds
it doesnt make any sense why would they run into us and if they were why wouldnt they do it at full speed
i dont know sir the romulans will sometimes make suicide attacks but only as a last resort theres no reason for it here
time to impact approximately sixty seconds
we dont have the luxury to speculate back us away from the distortion ensign one half impulse
aye sir

they are moving away commander
prepare attack sequence
all sections report ready for battle commander
disruptors fully charged
disengage cloak on my command prepare to fire
disregard that order
what
i do not authorise this attack you will cease battle operations immediately
i do not need your authorisation to attack major this is my ship
how typical of the military to resort to brute force when discretion is required
the enterprise has demonstrated that they can track us they must be destroyed
yes they can track us so if we attack them they will return fire and since we have no shields when were cloaked they will destroy us
are you questioning my ability to command
you are not fit to command step down step down or i will have you removed
do you think anyone here will listen to you
if any one of you defies the tal shiar you will not bear the punishment alone your families all of them will be there beside you i am now commander of this ship you will take orders from me and no one else remove commander toreth from her station if she resists shoot her
commander please step down
remove her weapon

now commander watch and learn in order to defeat your enemy you must first understand them the federation wishes to avoid war at all cost so i shall offer them a diplomatic solution get them to lower their shields and then destroy them


captain we are being hailed
on screen
i am major rakal of the tal shiar
i am jeanluc picard of the enterprise
how can we be of help
a corvallen freighter has been destroyed not far from here we have detected the residual effects of disruptor fire can you shed any light on this
a regrettable incident captain the freighter was fired upon by the former commander of this vessel i have now taken control and i assure you there will be no more attacks
still there was a considerable loss of life
captain we do not want to exaggerate this incident you and i can discuss it calmly we can diffuse it before it becomes inflated
i agree
i will come onto your ship please lower your shields and prepare to beam me aboard
very well mister worf lock onto major rakal transport on my command
aye sir
thank you

whats she doing on that ship
i dont know number one but she needs our help to get back mister worf keep your lock on her no matter what happens
yes sir
lower shields

their shields are dropping
activate forward disruptor array fire when ready
yes major firing

captain they have fired on us

shields up stand by phasers damage report
we sustained a direct hit but the damage was negligible the disruptor had almost no power
this is proconsul mret and his aides theyre part of the underground movement
theyre in stasis medical team to the bridge
aye sir
wheres deanna

disruptors were ineffective the enterprise was not damaged they have reestablished full shields
i am reading a malfunction in our forward disruptor array the power system has destabilised
youre lying the disruptor beam has been purposely sabotaged to conceal a transporter beam within quickly pilot locate transport coordinates what have you done
the transporter beam originated in our cargo bay something was transported from there to the enterprise
so major the mysterious cargo brought on board by major rakal of the tal shiar has been transported to the starfleet vessel i see two traitors in our midst

so major now that you can no longer take refuge behind the shield of the tal shiar its time to answer a few questions what was in those cargo containers well no matter we will soon know all we need to know and then we will execute you pilot drop shields and cloak the ship prepare to go to warp
aye sir

mister worf now

counsellor are you all right
yes
lets get you to sickbay

ensign get us out of here warp nine
aye sir

that about does it how does it feel to have your own face back
just right thank you
the men you helped rescue are safe proconsul mret is deeply grateful for your help
the thanks should go to nvek he sacrificed himself to save them and me
thanks to the two of you the way has been paved for further rescue operations nveks efforts and his sacrifice were not in vain
tapestry


bring the stasis units in here and have them online
yes doctor
tell doctor selar she can use ward three for the ambulatory cases and ill stay here
transporter room four to sickbay theyre coming in now
acknowledged stand clear and be ready

lets go lets go get him on here
what happened
the lenarians attacked us outside of the conference room

hes in cardiac arrest connect the pulmonary support units hes got internal haemorrhaging the bioregulator of his artificial hearts been fused hes got liver and spleen damage what kind of weapon caused this
a compressed teryon beam
forty ccs inaprovaline the activity in the isocortex is falling cortical stimulators now  again his respiratory system is shutting down the levels in the isocortex are still falling damn prepare a four percent series

 picard touches its hand and then sees who it is
welcome to the afterlife jeanluc youre dead
q what is going on
i told you youre dead this is the afterlife and im god
you are not god
blasphemy youre lucky i dont cast you out or smite you or something the bottom line is your life ended about five minutes ago under the inept ministrations of doctor beverly crusher
no i am not dead because i refuse to believe that the afterlife is run by you the universe is not so badly designed
very well if you really require more evidence of your postmortem status i guess ill just have to provide you some
jeanluc i told you not to go running off to that academy
father
i told you that starfleet would bring you to a bad end but you wouldnt listen now look at you dead before your time
q enough of this
enough what
why couldnt you have listened didnt you know that i was working for your best interests
q stop this
after all these years even now you manage to disappoint me jeanluc
hes not the only one whod like to have a word with you
why jeanluc why did you do it
captain there are still people down there you cant abandon them
there must be some other way captain some other choice than firing on them
if you continue on this course
a direct hit sir the ship is destroyed
these are the voices of all the people youve killed throughout the years
whom ive killed what do you mean
death has made you a little dim jeanluc these are the voices of all the people who have died through your actions or your inactions now if you have any words of apology or regret i believe theyre all listening theyre a surly bunch actually so dont drag this out too long
ive no intention of performing for your amusement
this is not for me this is for you jeanluc this is your opportunity to make peace with your sordid past
i find it hard to believe that you are doing this for the benefit of my soul
well now that youve shuffled off the mortal coil were free to spend a little time together
a little time together how much
eternity now youre sure you have no regrets or feelings of guilt about your former life i cant have you whining and complaining through time
if im really dead then my only regret is dying and finding you here
you wound me jeanluc after all i was not the cause of your death this was

is that
your artificial heart you might have lived if you had a real one instead of this unreliable piece of technology by the way how did you lose yours anyway
a mistake
is that a regret i hear
i regret a great many things from those days
really

it wasnt very smart of you to take on three nausicaans was it
no it wasnt
and did i hear a laugh its so unlike you jeanluc to have a sense of humour especially about getting stabbed through the back
i was a different person in those days arrogant undisciplined with far too much ego and too little wisdom i was more like you
then you must have been far more interesting pity you had to change
the pity is that i had to be impaled through the back before i learned that lesson i started that fight with those nausicaans i started it because because i was young and cocky if id been more responsible in those days i wouldnt have needed this heart and i wouldnt have died from a random energy surge thirty years later
so if you had it to do all over again
things would be different

 
bravo bravo
nicely done
cortan cortan zweller
 yes boy she mustve hit you pretty hard of course you deserved it
 youre slowing down there johnny you shouldve seen that one coming
marta batanides
are you okay
yes im fine im just a little disoriented thats all
come on hes just playing for sympathy now look im going to get something to eat and head over to the casino at bonestell you coming
ill catch up with you there
you sure youre okay
yes im fine really marta im fine
come on marty i bet hes got another date
thats it isnt it you are incorrigible

try not to end up in the hospital
attention on deck ensign picard
q
thats captain q to you young man
whats the point of creating this fantasy
this is no fantasy i assure you its all very real youre twenty one years old again a brash young man fresh out of the academy
i certainly dont look it
well to everyone else you do
so q i thought you told me that i was dead now it seems that im alive
oh you mortals are so obtuse why do you persist in believing that life and death are such static and rigid concepts why i can take your life and give it back to you again with the snap of a finger
lets say for the moment that may be true what is the purpose of bringing me here
you said you regretted a great many things in your life well heres a chance to change some of them
change them you mean change the past q even if you have been able to bring me back in time somehow surely you must realise that any alteration in this timeline will have a profound impact on the future
please spare me your egotistical musings on your pivotal role in history nothing you do here will cause the federation to collapse or galaxies to explode to be blunt youre not that important
i wont do it i wont alter history
oh very well since you attach so much importance to the continuity of time i will give you my personal guarantee that nothing you do here will end up hurting anyone or have an adverse affect on what you know of as history the only thing at stake here is your life and your peace of mind now whether you believe me or not you are here and you have a second chance what you choose to do with it is entirely up to you do you know where you are
starbase earhart we came here right after graduation to await our first deep space assignments
thats right its two days before your unfortunate encounter with a nausicaan sword you have that long to make whatever changes you wish if you can avoid getting stabbed through the heart this time which i doubt i will take you back to what you think of as the present and you can go on with your life with a real heart
then i wont die
of course youll die itll just be at a later time
what if i dont avoid the fight what if i wont make the changes
then you die on the table and we spend eternity together
wonderful
im glad you think so i am curious about one thing johnny why did that rather attractive woman strike you just now something you said
her name was corlina id arranged to take her out today and then she discovered that i had already made a second date with another woman called er penny and corlina was naturally upset
id no idea you were such a cad im impressed
computer what is the time right now
sixteen eleven hours
in fact penny is waiting for me right now
well carry on

youre awfully quiet today what happened to the dashing young ensign from last night the one with the winning smile and the smooth talk about my eyes
im just a little more contemplative
and what are you contemplating
penny er do you think we could just talk for a while i dont know anything about you where youre from what your interests are your last name
i come from rigel my last name is muroc and i like men in uniform i think thats enough talking

whats wrong i dont look as attractive to you as i did last night
no no not at all i think youre a very handsome woman
handsome thats something you say to old ladies
youre certainly not an old lady

i didnt want your pity

penny for your thoughts you never told me you were such a ladys man
i wasnt i was a puerile adolescent who allowed himself to be led by his hormones instead of his head
looks like your friends know how to have fun you ought to take lessons

excuse me

hes winning
of course
i thought you had a date
she decided to leave
youre getting old johnny

thank you thank you all thank you
very very nice i think you should forget about starfleet and play domjot for a living
nah this is nothing a little trigonometry some minor wrist action now barokie theres a game
human play domjot human
i think i could be persuaded to play one more game
corey dont play him
why
itll cause trouble hes a nausicaan they can get very illtempered if they lose
so can i
no corey listen to me this is a big mistake dont play him
whats gotten into you lets go
i see youve found your nausicaan friend you seem unimpaled so far
im sorry to disappoint you
ensign zweller seems to be doing well
hes going to lose the nausicaan is cheating
really im beginning to like these nausicaans
if history repeats itself corey will figure it out later tonight and then hell want revenge
and will you help your best friend avenge this injustice
i did last time i rigged the table so that he would win in a rematch
picard you cheated picard im impressed
it was a stupid mistake the nausicaan didnt take kindly to losing nor his friends they were outraged they wanted a fight i gave them one
thats a beautiful story it gets you right here doesnt it
ten
 domjot human play domjot

ive played a lot of domjot in a lot of places ive never seen the balls roll that well for anyone
so he was cheating
ill bet you that he had some sort of magnetic device in his belt it was controlling the balls
thats terrible
weve got to get even
what did you have in mind
well we could do to him what he did to us cheat only this time well rig the table so his devicell backfire on him
corey that wont solve anything
itll teach him that he cant go round cheating starfleet officers
all itll do is provoke him and provoking a nausicaan is not a good idea
i can handle him
what if hes not alone what if he brings some of his nausicaan friends with him
well then i guess that when ill have to depend on my friends to help me out
corey theres got to be a better way to handle this
when did you start backing away from a good fight
look corey were not cadets anymore were officers we should start to set a higher standard for ourselves
it was a good idea but lets just forget it okay

hell get over it
i hope so what
nothing its just youd usually be the one plotting revenge
yes that would be more in character wouldnt it
much but i always suspected you had a hidden streak of responsibility somewhere
perhaps its just that im getting older
maybe these bars are just starting to feel a little heavy ensign ensign picard and ensign batanides it sounds weird doesnt it
its going to take some getting used to
its too bad we cant get used to it together the three of us i mean
oh of course

come
flowers is there a john luck pickard here
from one of your conquests no doubt i guess some things arent going to change

did i interrupt anything sordid i hope
no q you did not
pity shes quite attractive
we were friends nothing more
is that another regret i hear my my were simply riddled with regrets about our youth now arent we
my friendship with marta is not something i regret
but you wish it had been more than just friendship dont you well maybe you can change all that
q what is it you want
i thought youd like to know that mister zweller has decided not to take your advice hes in the bonestell facility right now rigging the table to beat the nausicaan i guess you werent that persuasive


corey
ow johnny dont sneak up on me like that i thought you were the gambling foreman
sorry
im glad youre here hand me that magnaspanner
corey im not here to help you im here to stop you from making a serious mistake
you sound like my mother
cheating the nausicaans could have serious consequences for all of us its a risk we cant afford to take
you are my mother well gee mom i guess ill have to go tell those nausicaans i dont mind if they cheat me
this is not a joke corey
it better be now im going to finish my work here if you want to help me fine if not ill see you back at the starbase
i said youre not doing this
are you going to hit me johnny
no but ill tell the gambling foreman someones been tampering with his domjot table
all right have it your way ensign picard

i just couldnt make him understand
at least he did finally give it up
yes but he didnt take it very well
oh you know corey hell forget all about it by tomorrow
i hope youre right because he and i were friends for years after this i mean i hope we will be you know you keep smiling at me
well ive just never seen you like this before youre so serious
do i really seem that different
maybe im just not used to seeing you in your officers uniform no its more than that you do seem different well im not complaining or anything i think it suits you
really
yes its very attractive johnny havent you ever thought about us getting together
yes i have actually ive thought about it for a long time
why didnt you ever say so
i dont know and at this moment i really have no idea why not
youve said so now


morning darling feeling a little jumpy this morning are we guilty perhaps
i dont feel guilty about anything q
no were just friends q nothing more
and were still friends
so whats next
i dont know what i do know is things will be different
im sure

good morning
johnny
whats wrong
well this is the morning after huh
look i dont regret anything that happened last night i hope you dont either
i dont know weve been friends for a long time and and now im afraid weve ruined that friendship
then perhaps we should forget about what happened and try to
i wish i could it would make it much easier to say goodbye tomorrow were all supposed to get together later for our last big night before we ship out
i dont want you to do anything that makes you uncomfortable
weve planned it ill be there

well lets see youve managed to get slapped by one woman a drink thrown in your face by another and alienate your two best friends doing very well so far the only thing left to avoid is getting stabbed through the heart

i think youll like serving on board the ajax i hear that captain narth is an excellent officer
so i hear
well heres to the class of twenty seven

play domjot human give you a better chance give you a bigger stick maybe
i dont think were interested
they are undari cowards
what did you say
coward like all starfleet you talk and you talk but you have no guramba
why dont we find out
dont be a fool corey look there are plenty of other people to play domjot with now just go about your business
maybe i play with her give her good time

orcho lok resnik starfleet
im sorry corey he was reaching for a weapon
i dont know who you are any more but youre not my friend
goodbye johnny

congratulations mon capitaine you did it
can i help you


can i help you mister picard
mister worf

this is not for me you should take it to commander la forge in engineering
whats happened
is something wrong
im not sure mister worf what is my rank and position
you are a lieutenant junior grade assistant astrophysics officer
are you feeling all right
whos the captain of this ship
captain thomas halloway perhaps i should escort you to sickbay
no i can find my own way there thank you commander

beverly somethings happened to me im not sure
 vell vell vell vhat seems to be de trouble lieutenant picard
q what have you done
ive done exactly as i promised ive returned you to the present
but this is not the present i remember you said nothing would change
nothing has changed jeanluc except for you but then again thats what you wanted wasnt it to change the man you were in your youth well you did it this is the man you are today and you should be happy you have a real heart beating in your chest and you get to live out the rest of your life in safety running tests making analyses and carrying reports to your superiors


excuse me am i interrupting
no not at all have a seat
thank you id like to talk to you for a moment about my future on the enterprise
of course lieutenant jeanluc isnt it
maybe i should go
no please counsellor i would very much like to hear your thoughts first of all and i would like you to be absolutely straightforward with me how would you evaluate me as an officer
well er your performance records have always been good youre thorough dedicated
reliable steady  punctual
i see what would you say if i told you that i believed that i was capable of being very much more
perhaps we should discuss this at your next evaluation
i would appreciate it if we could discuss it now you see i feel that i would like to move beyond astrophysics to engineering or security something that might even lead to command
frankly lieutenant i dont think thats realistic
why
i really dont think this is the place to be discussing this
please this is important to me i believe that i can do more
hasnt that been the problem all along throughout your career youve had lofty goals but youve never been willing to do whats necessary to attain them
would that be your evaluation as well commander
i think i have to agree with the counsellor if you want to get ahead you have to take chances stand out in a crowd get noticed
i see
now we dont want to lose you youre a very good officer
just not one who stands out
why dont i talk to commander la forge in engineering and well see what we can do
but command
well well see
senior officers please report to the captains ready room
acknowledged
we should talk about this later

all right q thats enough youve made your point q
la forge to lieutenant picard im still waiting for that statistical analysis
im on my way sir

main engineering are you having a good laugh now q does it amuse you to think of me living out the rest of my life as a dreary man in a tedious job

i gave you something most mortals never experience a second chance at life and now all you can do is complain
i cant live out my days as that person that man is bereft of passion and imagination that is not who i am
au contraire hes the person you wanted to be one who was less arrogant and undisciplined as a youth one who was less like me the jeanluc picard you wanted to be the one who did not fight the nausicaan had quite a different career from the one you remember that picard never had a brush with death never came face to face with his own mortality never realised how fragile life is or how important each moment must be so his life never came into focus he drifted for much of his career with no plan or agenda going from one assignment to the next never seizing the opportunities that presented themselves he never lead the away team on milika three to save the ambassador or take charge of the stargazers bridge when its captain was killed and no one ever offered him a command he learned to play it safe and he never ever got noticed by anyone
youre right q you gave me the chance to change and i took the opportunity but i admit now it was a mistake
are you asking me for something jeanluc
give me a chance to put things back the way they were before
before you died in sickbay is that what you want
i would rather die as the man i was than live the life i just saw

coward like all starfleet you talk and you talk but you have no guramba
what did you say
i said you are a coward
thats what i thought you said



his vital signs are stable captain jeanluc youve been injured but i think youre going to be all right

i still dont know what to make of it was it a dream was it one of qs elaborate tricks
a lot of people near death have talked about strange experiences but ive never heard one so detailed
and you know theres still a part of me that cannot accept that q would give me a second chance or that he would demonstrate so much compassion and if it was q i owe him a debt of gratitude
in what sense it sounds like he put you through hell
there are many parts of my youth that im not proud of there were loose threads untidy parts of me that i would like to remove but when i pulled on one of those threads it unraveled the tapestry of my life
i was just trying to imagine a hellbent for leather young officer insulting a nausicaan twice his size i wish id had a chance to know that jeanluc picard
oh well to tell the truth that wasnt the first runin id had with a couple of surly nausicaans
really
oh yes during my sophomore year i was assigned to training on morikin seven well there was a nausicaan outpost on one of the outlying asteroids and one day
birthright part 

captains log stardate  the enterprise has arrived at station deep space nine to assist in the reconstruction of the bajoran aqueduct systems damaged during the cardassian occupation

i should be through with the water contaminant analysis in a few hours then im going to check out one of the holosuites they have got a relaxation programme here jeanluc from alture seven listen to this first they bath you in a protein bath then a cloud of chromal vapour carries you into a meditation chamber you should try it
well ill be too busy discussing the finer points of water management with ten bajoran bureaucrats and they wont be carrying me on a cloud of chromal vapour ops

what is this
its pasta al fiorella one of my favourites dont worry youll love it you know i really want to take a look at those ktarian antiques i understand theyve got a twenty first century plasma coil in almost perfect condition  ill have to talk to chief obrien about these replicators worf i dont see how you can eat that stuff it tastes like liquid polymer
delicious
you know i think im going to try that kiosk on the other side of the promenade it looked like they had some real food

commander i am reading a minor power drain in the starboard eps conduit
whats causing it
the problems originating in sickbay there has been an unauthorized access into the computers bioimaging systems
youd better check it out
aye sir


excuse me do you have authorisation to work in this area
come in come in i need a hand with this field generator see if you can boost the power output to sixty five percent
i am sorry but use of sickbay equipment is limited to ships medical personnel
ah doctor julian bashir chief medical officer deep space nine and you are commander
data
commander data the synthetic lifeform
yes
its an honour to meet you sir ive heard so much about you you must have a fascinating perspective into biocybernetic research id be delighted if we could discuss the subject sometime
i would be happy to do so however i must ask you to stop your experiment
ah yes i realise i should have asked before using your sickbay but it wouldve taken me days to analyse this device with the computer i have on deep space nine
what type of device is this
it was discovered in the gamma quadrant i think it must be some sort of medical instrument
it appears to employ plasma inputs
im hoping its a medical scanner i wanted to use your computer to find out how it works
i suggest we take it to engineering and run a complete circuitpathway diagnostic
splendid i must admit commander i didnt think youd be so personable


klingon you are starfleet klingon
i am lieutenant worf
worf son of mogh
what of it
i am jaglom shrek a man with information to sell
you have no information i could use
i would not be so sure it is about your father mogh
my father died twenty five years ago at khitomer
that is what you believe what if i tell you he is still alive

my father is dead
no hes not i know where he is
how is that possible
i expect to be paid for my information perhaps we could negotiate an exchange the location of your father for
tell me what you know
not all of the klingons at khitomer were killed during the massacre many were captured by the romulans and placed in a prison camp on a remote planet your father was among them
where is this planet
not far from here i could give you the location for a price
a klingon would rather die than be taken prisoner i should kill you for spreading lies about my family my father was killed defending khitomer

ensign lopez this duty roster is unacceptable the assignments should be listed in order of priority prepare it again i will expect it no later than oh nine hundred hours dismissed
worf we need to get your rendezvous schedule to commander rudman on board the merrimac as soon as you
i am well aware of your request commander
lieutenant are you all right
yes sir i am fine i will send your schedule sir excuse me


enter
did the table do something wrong
no
im glad you werent that hard on ensign lopez
he made a mistake the duty roster was inaccurate
would you like to talk about whats bothering you or would you like to break some more furniture
today on the promenade a yridian approached me he knew who i was and tried to sell me information about mogh
your father
he claimed that hes alive and is being held captive in a romulan prison camp
my god could it be true
a klingon would never allow himself to be captured a warrior fights to the death if my father were alive it would dishonour his sons and their sons for three generations even alexander would bear the burden of guilt
so youre willing to ignore the possibility because youre concerned about dishonour
my father is dead that yridian is selling lies
if youre so sure about that why are you still so upset worf you cant deny the possibility just because you dont want it to be true if you want to talk about this you know where to find me

if we transfer twenty megajoules of energy from the dilithium chamber into the plasma inputs it should be sufficient to activate the device
its worth a try you two can begin by connecting the coil to the chamber ill configure the energy transfer
right data can i ask you a personal question
certainly
does your hair grow
i can control the rate of my follicle replenishment however i have not yet had a reason to modify the length of my hair why do you ask
just curious
power conduits are ready is something wrong doctor
youre breathing
yes i do have a functional respiration system however its purpose is to maintain thermal control of my internal systems i am in fact capable of functioning for extended periods in a vacuum
and you have a pulse
my circulatory system not only produces biochemical lubricants it regulates microhydraulic power most people are interested in my extraordinary abilities how fast i can compute my memory capacity how long i will live no one has ever asked me if my hair will grow or noticed that i can breathe
your creator went to a lot of trouble to make you seem human i find that fascinating
okay i think were ready to begin the transfer
power connections are complete
ill monitor the coils transfer rate will you keep an eye on the transient power response
of course we are ready geordi
okay initiating energy transfer

power levels are holding steady
transient response is normal
hold on im picking up a power surge reduce the transfer rate
reducing rate by twenty percent

what happened
the power connections blew it sent out some kind of plasma shock
his synaptic energy is dropping




data are you all right
i believe so what has happened
a plasma shock overloaded your positronic net you were down a good thirty seconds
that cannot be possible i have a memory record for that period of time i can recall a series of images i saw doctor soong my father

data i cant find anything wrong with your positronic subprocessors or your circuit controllers no sign of any residual energy fluctuation cascade overload
my internal diagnostic indicates that my memory systems are functioning within normal parameters for the forty seven seconds that i was inactive there is no record of cognitive activity
theres no doubt about it data you were completely shut down maybe you had some kind of random power fluctuation caused you to access one of your memory files
that cannot be the image i saw was of doctor soong as a young man i did not encounter him until much later in his life there appears to be no rational explanation for my experience
ill take another look at the diagnostic log in the meantime youd better disconnect that device
data perhaps were going about this the wrong way
how so
well maybe you had a dream or a hallucination
i am not capable of either of those functions
yet you cant account for what happened today can you
at present i cannot
well maybe you should approach this from a more human standpoint youre right that machines cant have hallucinations but then again most machines cant grow hair


wait what is it commander
i am sorry to bother you but i have a question of a personal nature do you have a moment
a moment
i have heard you mention that you once experienced a vision
yes when i was young my adoptive parents arranged for me to partake in the rite of majqa
i understand it involves deep meditation in the lava caves of nomat that prolonged exposure to the heat induces a hallucinatory effect
why are you asking me about this
i have recently had an unusual experience which might be described as a vision
what happened
an accident in engineering shut down my cognitive functions for a short period of time yet i seemed to remain conscious i saw my father
you are very fortunate that is a powerful vision
if it was a vision i do not know how to proceed
you must find its meaning if it has anything to do with your father you must learn all you can about it in the klingon majqa ritual there is nothing more important than receiving a revelation about your father your father is part of you always learning about him teaches you about yourself that is why no matter where he is or what he has done you must find him
but i am not looking for my father
yes of course do not stop until you have the answer
thank you worf


lieutenant worf you have reconsidered
yes i wish to go to the romulan prison camp
excellent i can provide you with the coordinates
no you will take me there
no its not possible i have no means of transportation
i checked the station records you have a vessel that is capable of warp speed
i i do not have the time i have other business

what is the real reason you do not wish to take me is it because what you have told me is not true
no the camp is located on the edge of romulan space it is a dangerous journey
dangerous it would be more dangerous for you to refuse
very well but i will require full payment in advance
no no i will pay you after
but

yes yes of course after
if you are lying if there is no prison camp i will kill you

the romulan guards have a detection perimeter it will be necessary to transport you to the surface thirty kilometres from the prison camp
the foliage is very dense it will take me approximately twelve hours to reach the camp i may have to travel during the night
that would be unwise this is not an empty jungle there are many predators
i am prepared
very well but i recommend that you look up from time to time the arboreal needle snake likes to attack from above i will provide you with a map of the camp
how did you learn of this camp
it is not important for you to know
why have you not informed the klingon government of this place
i sell information i do not give it away
you do this for profit
i have my reasons mister worf
what reasons could you have for letting these people suffer
we will arrive in the carraya sector in approximately three hours i suggest you get some rest

come

yes mister data
i am sorry to disturb you sir
not at all im here studying the intricacies of bajoran aqueduct management i would welcome an interruption please sit down
i require your advice i have come to an impasse regarding my recent unexplained experience
your vision of doctor soong how is your investigation proceeding
i have analysed over four thousand different religious and philosophical systems as well as over two hundred psychological schools of thought in an effort to understand what happened
and what have you found
i have been unable to find a single interpretation of the images i saw during the time i was shut down the hammer for instance has several meanings the klingon culture views the hammer as a symbol of power however the taqua tribe of nagor sees it as an icon of hearth and home the ferengis view it as a sign of sexual prowess
im curious mister data why are you looking at all these other cultures
the interpretation of visions and other metaphysical experiences are almost always culturally derived and i have no culture of my own
yes you do youre a culture of one which is no less valid than a culture of one billion perhaps the key to understanding your experience is to stop looking into other sources for a meaning when we look at michaelangelos david or symnays tomb and we dont ask what does this mean to other people the real question is what does it mean to us explore this image data let it excite your imagination focus on it see where it leads you let it inspire you
i believe i understand sir thank you
good luck mister data




the camp is in a southeasterly direction after approximately ten kilometres you will come to the edge of the sulphur canyon look for a riverbank and follow it until you come to the camp this is a homing device it will allow you to find my ship when i return i will not be landing in the same location
when will you return
fifty hours do not be late

whos there toq is that you i can see you i hope youre enjoying yourself toq i swear i will hang you by your

stop please
who are you
ive come to help you
help me
yes how did you get out of the camp does anyone know you are gone
yes i come here often
you must lead me to the camp
you are klingon where did you come from
that does not matter i have come to take you home
home this is my home
bael
it is very important you tell no one you saw me

is it time for the ceremony
yes were about to begin


come in
data what are you doing we were supposed to meet at

data what are you doing
i am painting
i can see that how long have you been at this
i have created twenty three individual illustrations in the past six hours twenty seven minutes i believe you could say i have been inspired
ill say
i have done as captain picard suggested i have tried to explore the images
has it helped
i am not certain i began by painting the image of the blacksmith then i painted the corridor after that the anvil the hammer and doctor soongs face the thought then occurred to me that i should paint smoke
smoke why smoke
i cannot explain it it is not an image i saw during my vision
well you have the smoke coming out of a bucket of water blacksmiths used to use water to cool the metal maybe thats why you painted it
perhaps after i painted the smoke it then occurred to me to paint a birds wing i then drew an entire bird a flock of birds flying in formation an individual feather if the image of a bird is related to my vision i do not understand how i am left with more of a mystery than ever geordi i would like to recreate the experiment which caused my initial shut down
what for
i do not know how much longer my vision would have continued had i not been reactivated
data that plasma shock almost fused your neural net i dont think its such a good idea to try that again
i am aware of the risks involved but i can think of no other way to investigate my experience will you help
yeah yeah sure ill go find doctor bashir
i will prepare the power transfer

okay data were going to monitor every subsystem in your positronic net if i see any neural pathways overload beyond sixty five percent im shutting down the experiment
agreed
were ready
initiating energy transfer get ready data
power levels are rising
it should be any second now



the bird did not appear in my original experience this vision is different


of course its different its never the same always changing unpredictable it doesnt make sense
what is happening father
i dont know data what is happening
we are on the bridge of the enterprise my cat is present my potted plant and my paintings
a beginning still a little grounded in the mundane but showing promise
i do not understand
youre not supposed to no man should know where his dreams come from it spoils the mystery the fun im proud of you son i wasnt sure youd ever develop the cognitive abilities to make it this far but if youre here if you can see me youve crossed over the threshold from being a collection of circuits and subprocessors and have started a wonderful journey
what type of journey

think of it think of it as an empty sky
i do not understand
shh just dream data dream data you are the bird


the images i saw during the time i was shut down were generated by a series of previously dormant circuits in my neural net i believe doctor soong incorporated those circuits into my base programming intending to activate them when i reached a certain level of development
but the plasma shock activated them prematurely
that is correct
im curious now that those circuits are active what are you going to do with them
i plan to shut down my cognitive functions for a brief period each day i hope to generate new internal visions
it sounds to me like youre talking about dreaming
an accurate analogy
remarkable you know this is just the kind of thing that might get me published in the starfleet cybernetics journal would you mind if i authored a paper on all this
of course not
thank you data and sweet dreams



 vanaj javdich qong dir savich ghih yot quelipa qevas hoh qa teblawnghu mughatodu yljaqo yljaqo yljaqo

quiet im a friend
who who are you
worf son of mogh
why have you come here
i have come to find my father is he alive is he here
your father fell at khitomer
did he die in battle
he was fortunate
you were captured
yes
romulans they robbed you of your right to die in battle theres very little time how many klingons are being held here
seventy three
how many romulans guard the camp
worf there are things you do not understand
what do you mean
i must speak with the elders

ghos i knew your father well worf and i remember you a boy barely able to lift a batleth once your father insisted we take you on the ritual hunt you were so eager you tried to take the beast with your bare hands it mauled your arm
i still have the scar i do remember you now
you should not have come here worf
i do not understand
you should not have come
who is this
i am worf son of mogh i have come to help you escape
he does not know
 he must leave at once
no it is too late for that he would bring others vang ghah

we are not leaving here and neither are you
to be continued
birthright part 

last time on star trek the next generation
not all the klingons at khitomer were killed during the massacre many were captured by the romulans and placed in a prison camp on a remote planet your father was among them
if my father were alive it would his sons and their sons for three generations even alexander would bear the burden of guilt
so youre willing to ignore the possibility because youre concerned about dishonour
my father is dead that yridian is selling lies
this is a homing device it will allow you to find my ship when i return
you are klingon where did you come from
that does not matter i have come to take you home
he must leave at once
no its too late for that now he would bring others we are not leaving here and neither are you
and now the conclusion

take his pack
are you afraid to die while escaping
we are dead worf we died at khitomer
we were captured it was worse than death
why did you allow it to happen
we had no choice we were defending an outpost on the perimeter the romulans took out our shields the next blast rendered us unconscious when we awoke we were prisoners unarmed and shackled
we were interrogated for three months we tried to starve ourselves but they kept us alive
the romulan commander tokath thought he was being kind
the romulans hoped to trade our lives for territorial concessions but the klingon high council refused to negotiate they would not acknowledge that their warriors had been taken prisoner
and when it was clear that we would be of no use to them tokath offered to let us go
but we knew that our families believed we had fallen in battle so we did not wish to return to dishonour them
we asked tokath to let us stay and he took pity on us
i understand your desire to preserve your familys honour but what of your own there is no honour in remaining prisoners
we lost our honour when we were captured it does not matter what happens to us
all that matters is that our families are not dishonoured
why did you come here if you had found your father you would have found only dishonour
if he had been captured as you were if i had found him here i would be glad to see him there is no room in my heart for shame
i can only hope that if my son came here he would be klingon enough to kill me


this is a gintak spear
what of it
have your parents taught you nothing this is used for battle not tilling soil
we have no need for weapons here the war is far away
what war
the war our parents came here to escape
that war was over many years ago
im not interested in what you have to say klingon i have work to do

hello again worf they say youve come to stay with us
not by choice
arent you happy to have escaped the war
the war
yes weve heard the stories all our lives how people are slaughtered in terrible battles forced to fight whether they want to or not thats why our parents came here to make a safe home a place where they could raise their children in peace i should think youd be relieved to get away from the fighting youre safe here
a place can be safe and still be a prison where i come from people are free to come and go as they choose
so are we
tell your father that you would like to leave tell him that you would like to visit the klingon home world see what he says
why would i want to go there its dangerous
not any longer
bael come here
yes mother you are not allowed to leave the compound then i suppose i wont be seeing you at the pond again
i told you not to speak with him
im sorry mother



enter

i am tokath i can return later if i am disturbing you
it is a strange thing when a jailer concerns himself with his prisoners comfort
mine is a strange prison
you robbed the klingons of who they were you dishonoured them
by not slitting their throats when we found them unconscious
i do not expect you to understand you are a romulan
youre just like lkor was twenty years ago proud and angry he hated me all the klingons did and i had no love for them i wont deny it when i informed the high command that the klingons wanted to remain here i was told that unless i stayed to oversee them myself they would be killed my decision ended my military career
why did you do it
i dont expect you to understand youre a klingon but i do expect you to understand this weve put aside the old hatreds here romulans and klingons live in peace i wont allow you to destroy what we have
do not deceive yourself these people are not happy here i see the sadness in their eyes
thats not what i see when i look in my wifes eyes i married a klingon so you see when i warn you not to disrupt our lives here im not speaking just as a jailer but as a man protecting his family do not test my tolerance


bagh da tuhmoh chojah duh rho yljaqo yljaqo yljaqo
do you know what that song means
no i just like the melody

stop


there

captains log stardate  the yridian vessel lieutenant worf boarded at deep space nine has failed to arrive for our scheduled rendezvous it is now twelve hours overdue

still no sign of them on long range scanners
contact ds find out what they know about this yridian trader
hopefully he filed a flight plan before he left the station
thats the only chance we have of finding worf

we havent had to use one of these for a long time it implants a small boridium pellet under the skin  we can use its energy signature to track you
in time you will grow accustomed to life here
never
he is one of yours deal with him however you like but i warn you if he becomes a disruption i will not be so tolerant
toq you guard him he is free to move around inside the compound but make certain he does not cause trouble


what are you doing
this is the mokbara the form clears the mind and centres the body

no like this first you must learn to breathe stand tall as tall as you can now take a wider stance
you must stop

these forms are the basis for klingon combat you would be wise to learn them i will teach you join us
well see what lkor thinks of this

mother shes not here come in this is what i wanted to show you

i dont know why but im not supposed to look at these things theyre klingon arent they
yes
i thought you might be able to tell me about them
this is a warriors armour and this is a dk tahg  it should not be allowed to rust like this

isnt it beautiful
that is a jinaq it is given to a daughter who has come of age old enough to take a mate
bael
mother
take that off at once
why is she forbidden to know what these things are
they are not needed here go


kahless held his fathers lifeless body in his arms he could not believe what his brother had done then his brother threw their fathers sword into the sea saying if he could not possess it neither would kahless that was the last time the brothers would speak
what happened to the sword
kahless looked into the sea and wept for the sword is all he had left of his father the ocean filled with his tears and flooded beyond the shore
that is impossible
for you perhaps not kahless he was a great warrior
youre making it up
no these are our stories they tell us who we are
it is late it is time to sleep

worf you never answered my question did kahless ever find his fathers sword
yes he found it
the stories that you tell are they true
i have studied them all of my life and find new truths in them every time
this kahless did he ever take a mate
that is another story
tell me

you are romulan
tokath is my father i thought you knew that
how could your mother mate with a romulan
why shouldnt she
it is an obscenity
what are you saying they love each other
romulans are treacherous deceitful they are without honour
my father is a good man he is kind and generous there is nothing dishonourable about him
he took part in a cowardly attack at khitomer thousands of klingons were massacred many of them women and children
i dont know what youre talking about my father came here to escape the wars he would never kill anybody
ask him ask your mother tell them you want to know the truth


what is it number one
weve just received the yridians flight plan from deep space nine
he gets around hes been to three different systems in this past week he could have left worf at any of them
are any of these systems near romulan space
two of them the nequencia and the carraya systems

lets head for the closer one
aye sir

what do you want
i am sorry if i upset you

i was surprised i became angry but i do not blame you you cannot help being what you are
theres nothing wrong with what i am
what i mean is it is not your fault
what being born im sorry if that offends you
no i it is hard to explain klingons and romulans are blood enemies have been for centuries
not here here we live in peace
but i dont live here
worf before you knew you were attracted to me cant you leave the hatred behind too cant you accept me as i am
i do not know


come on toq

whos next okay try again

kala
that is not how you play this game
the qavak is not a game it hones the skills of the hunt
the hunt we have replicators here
klingons do not hunt because they need food the hunt is a ritual that reminds us of where we come from
i know where i came from right here
it is a difficult skill to master perhaps you are too young
throw it

your arm is strong but you need practice hold your other arm like this and aim along it roll

you learn quickly perhaps it is time to put your skills to the test
what do you mean
come i will take you on the hunt
you are not allowed to leave the compound they wont allow it
i think they will

hunting have you lost your mind
the boy can come with me i cannot sit in the compound like an old man i must practice my skills
we cant let you out youve already tried to escape once
i give you my word as a warrior i will not try to escape
leave us we have work to do
tokath he gave his word
are you seriously suggesting that we open the gates and let him wander free with only a boy as his guard
twenty three years ago i gave you my word in all this time have i ever broken it
i told you he was yours to deal with if you want to take this risk the responsibility is yours
you will go with him take a weapon if he breaks his word and tries to escape kill him


he is there the wind has shifted we must wait
why were so close
never approach your prey from upwind the breeze will carry your scent the wind is shifting again
i cant smell anything
he is there
how can you yes i can smell it
remember the scent more than anything else it will guide you
it is strong i cannot believe i couldnt smell it before
let it work its way into your blood
i can feel my heart pounding
yes this is the moment where life and death meet this is what we are warriors
i was never taught that
there is much you were never taught


arent you hungry lkor or are you upset because your prisoner has not returned
i should not have sent the boy with him if he has been hurt
dont worry my friend theyll come back after all a warrior keeps his word isnt that so
father if i wanted to visit romulus or the klingon home world would i be allowed to go

kala tonight we eat well
get that off my table
you do not kill an animal unless you intend to eat it
get rid of it
i intend to tokath but not until its cooked today i learned the ritual hunt but that is not all i learned i discovered that warriors blood runs in my veins i do not know how or why but we have forgotten ourselves our stories are not told our songs are not sung tonight as we came home we sang a song of victory a song known only to me as a lullaby but it is a warriors song bagh da tuhmoh fire streaks the heavens chojah duh rho battle has begun bagh da tuhmoh chojah duh rho yljaqo yljaqo yljaqo

bael
yljaqo yljaqo yljaqo

well worf youve had quite an effect on the young people
i have done nothing more than show them what they are
no you have shown them what you want them to be tell me this do you know of any place any time in history when klingons and romulans have lived together in peace we have despised each other fought each other for centuries except here on this remote planet romulans and klingons live together in harmony no government no leader has ever done what i have done here
and what about toq i saw what happened to him when he caught the scent of his prey on the wind for the first time in his life he felt powerful and that is what he has been denied living here and that is what you have tried to take away from him now you may be content to sit here in the jungle and wither to old age but toq and the others have tasted what it is to feel truly alive and they will not give that up now
enough of this we could talk all night and not convince each other i offer you a choice live with us as one of us
or
or i will have you put to death
then that is what you will have to do
worf consider this carefully
that death will be honourable the young people will see what it is to die as a klingon


enter
 thank you i will remove the tracking device then you can go over the wall and hide in the jungle
why are you doing this
my father is wrong no matter how i might feel about you you dont deserve to die
i am not going to run away bael
they will kill you
yes but they will not defeat me
i dont understand you
a klingon does not run away from his battles
is that really the lesson you want us to learn youve taught us a great deal awakened something in us that we never knew existed but i dont understand what we can learn from your death
then you do not yet understand what it is to be klingon
worf in spite of everything thats happened i still sense that you care for me am i wrong you talk so much about being a warrior about honour and death is it so hard to speak of love worf please
i would not have thought it possible to love a romulan
but you do
yes
well if youve come that far cant you take it one more step cant you stay here with us with me
if there were a way i would take you away with me
if there is anything that ive learned from you from your reaction to me its that i have no place out there other klingons will not accept me for what i am
and if i stay here these klingons will not accept me for what i am
why did you come here we were so happy we didnt know there was anything missing in our lives
bael

goodbye worf


i know that there are those among you who may question what im about to do and you would not be wrong to do so i have questioned myself i have spent the night considering my decision challenging myself to justify whether it is right and i have reached the conclusion that it is absolutely necessary to put this man to death what we have built together would be destroyed by this man and i cannot allow that to happen i give you one last chance to accept our way of life
those are eloquent word tokath but the truth is i am being executed because i brought something dangerous to your young people knowledge knowledge of their origins knowledge of the real reasons you are here in this camp the truth is a threat to you
enough stand ready raise your weapons
father
stop this

if you kill him you will have to kill me
step aside toq
worf would rather die than accept this way of life and so would i i want to leave as do many others you will have to kill us to keep us here
you see tokath it is already too late
i am warning you move aside now

stand ready
toq move away
take aim

bael
tokath long ago when your captives asked to stay here our hope was to avoid dishonouring our children on the home world but perhaps over the years we lost sight of our children that we raised here this is our prison it should not be theirs
years ago your parents made a great sacrifice for the sake of their families today they do so again for that we must honour them you must promise them never reveal to their secret no one must know of this place
a supply ships due in a few days they will take us when they arrive tokath will explain it to them then we will start a new life
captains log supplemental our search for lieutenant worf was cut short when we received a cryptic message from him requesting a rendezvous with a romulan vessel he has informed us we will be taking on passengers


its good to see you he seems fine were giving everyone a thorough checkups in sickbay
thank you doctor

welcome home mister worf
thank you sir
picard to bridge signal the romulan ship that the last group is on board
aye sir
you found what you were looking for mister worf
no sir there was no prison camp those young people are survivors of a vessel that crashed in the carraya system four years ago no one survived khitomer
i understand
starship mine

captains log stardate  the enterprise is docked at the remmler array where it will undergo a routine procedure to eliminate accumulated baryon particles in preparation for the sweep we are evacuating the ship

attention personnel on decks fourteen and fifteen your transporter room assignment has been changed report to transporter room three
captain were still behind schedule on decks seven and eight shall i tell arkaria base therell be a delay
no open up the transporters in cargo bay two and divert everyone from deck seven to there that should put it back on track
right
all beta shift engineering personnel are requested to report to main engineering prior to disembarking
captain arkaria base does not have the medical storage units i have requested i have seven living tissue samples that wont survive the baryon sweep anymore than you or i would ive tried to reason with them but
all right all right have commander laforge transport a stasis unit from the astrophysics lab you should be able to convert it to store tissue samples
thank you captain
all science personnel please check in with your section chief for stationside duty assignments
captain  i was just heading for deck seven ive put the autoshutdown sequence on hold until we get back on schedule
oh i think we can resume the sequence counsellor troi is taking care of the situation on deck seven
aye sir

captain
bridge
it has been quite a day has it not
yes it has
however a change of routine is often invigorating and can be a welcome diversion after a long assignment
exactly
i understand that arkaria has some very interesting weather patterns
mister data are you all right
yes sir i am attempting to fill a silent moment with nonrelevant conversation
small talk
yes sir i have found that humans often use small talk during awkward moments therefore i have written a new subroutine for that purpose how did i do
perhaps it was a little too nonrelevant but if you really are interested in small talk then you should keep your eye on commander hutchinson at the reception this afternoon hes a master
thank you sir i will

captain
captain

after you sir
no after you
no sir i believe you spoke first
gentlemen gentlemen were running out of time mister worf
the computer needs your authorisation to disable command functions during the baryon sweep
are we ready commander la forge
almost ive requested two additional field diverters one for the computer core and one for the bridge they havent been installed yet
additional units
yes sir weve logged in five years more warp hours than most ships do in ten so our baryon particle levels are high im a little concerned that when the remmler array starts to sweep the ship itll have to use a stronger beam than normal in order to get rid of all the radiation
and that might overload the field diverters protecting our key systems how long until the new ones are in place
id say about twenty minutes
very well computer disable all command functions in thirty minutes authorisation picard gamma six zero seven three
authorisation acknowledged
captain incoming message its the station administrator mister orton
in my ready room mister worf
captain request permission to be excused from commander hutchinsons reception
permission granted i wish i could excuse myself as well
captain permission to be
mister la forge i cannot excuse my entire senior staff mister worf beat you to it

go ahead mister orton
 captain if youre on schedule id like to confirm that well begin the baryon sweep at fifteen hundred hours approximately one hour from now
confirmed
commander hutchinson also wanted me to make sure that youll be able to attend his reception this afternoon
tell him im looking forward to it
hell be delighted to hear that arkaria base out


 tell arkaria base that were almost finished here
 were going to need two more conduits
 i need to run a diagnostic on the diverter
 get the diverter aligned so that we can begin the isolation procedure
wheres the odn interface


beverly lovely as ever how do you manage it
its good to see you again
its been far too long what is it four years now i want to hear everything that happened after you left starfleet medical and i have so much to tell you oh that must be commander riker excuse me
of course

pardon me
you must be will riker
i must be
calvin hutchinson call me hutch calvin awful name ive never forgiven my parents as soon as i saw you i knew you had to be the enterprises first officer
oh
of course your reputation proceeds you flashing blue eyes square jaw quite the ladies man i hear now dont be modest will may i call you will

sure
i also hear that youre a musician i certainly hope youll play something for us its not often we get to entertain the command crew of the flagship oh and speaking of command hello captain picard
commander
i was just telling your first officer what a real pleasure it is to have all of you here so how are you anyway
very well thank you

it is very good to see you both again beverly may i call you beverly beverly have you noticed that the mean temperature here on arkaria is slightly higher normal for human comfort levels i have found that humans prefer a body temperature of twenty one degrees celsius in order to operate most efficiently however there are several cultures who actually prefer that their body temperature is identical to the temperature of the room in which they are standing the sheliak for example
im telling you you have never seen anything like this there were thousands of these creatures the whole northern sky turned dark i
oh er geordi deanna i dont think youve met our host this is lieutenant commander geordi la forge counsellor deanna troi this is commander hutchinson
oh please call me hutch
hello
i was just telling your captain about some of the fascinating sights here on arkaria either of you interested in ornithology
er well
the mating habits of the arkarian horn fowl are quite interesting if the weather were better we could take horses to the southern promontory and visit the nesting grounds
horses
yes we have a network of trails through the plains unfortunately its not very pleasant right now cold muddy not a soul for kilometres
sounds perfect mister la forge how long before the baryon sweep begins on the enterprise
about twenty five minutes sir
then i have enough time to back to the ship and get my saddle
your saddle
yes a saddle is a very personal thing it has to be broken in used cared for
you keep a saddle on board the enterprise
oh yes yes i never know when ill have the opportunity to ride
i see
its perfectly normal most serious riders do have their own saddles
of course
absolutely
well if youll excuse me

amazing man you know he reminds me of another officer i knew years ago a captain edwell now he was fascinating born on gaspar seven but you wouldnt know it from the way he looked


autoshutdown sequence in progress defensive systems offline baryon sweep begins in eight minutes

what are you doing

someone left this odn junction box open i thought your crew was supposed to be off the ship once the field diverters were in place
the diverters have to be synchronised i was laser bonding a backup link
i see well id better let you finish up so you can get off the ship
excuse me a minute

autoshutdown sequence in progress primary power offline in one minute


get pomet started on it right away
primary power offline in thirty seconds

final warning primary power offline in ten seconds


hmm yes i find it fascinating that your family chose to drop the prefix pel from your surname it was my understanding that pel orton is a more noble appellation on arkaria than simply orton
yes
perhaps the recent arkarian trend toward a more egalitarian society is partly responsible eh
perhaps
the crew of the magellan actually put on a talent show here captain conklin did a poetry reading if you can imagine that
im trying to
did i ever tell you how i came to be stationed here its a fascinating story i was serving on admiral mitchells staff on starbase ninety seven awful place by the way
have you met our commander data
as a matter of fact i find it oddly amusing
no i dont think so
ill introduce you
there are several cultures in this sector with extremely similar etymological histories for example
mister data i dont know if youve had a chance to meet our host commander hutchinson call him hutch lieutenant commander data our second officer
a pleasure
the pleasure is mine hutch i have been meaning to compliment you on your choice of colours here
oh you really think so it wasnt easy making a final decision let me tell you
i can well imagine the light in this room would make colour selection exceptionally problematic
precisely
thank you
youre welcome im not sure which one to feel sorry for
mister orton
youll excuse me commander
geordi what happened to the captain
oh he went back to the ship to get his saddle
his saddle
any serious rider would have his own saddle
oh
probably he went right to the stables i bet hes ten kilometres from here already
lucky him thank you


kelsey to devor devor this is kelsey reply devor do you read me kelsey to kiros
this is kiros
devor isnt responding there must be too much interference from the baryon sweep go find him and see if he finished by passing the regulator on deck seven then meet us in main engineering
understood

hey hey who are you what are you doing on my ship
the baryon sweep uses a highfrequency plasma field your phaser wont work
youre probably right but id like to bet this will a laser welder can be deadly whats going on in main engineering i suggest that you cooperate
youre starfleet you wont kill me
you sure

seems youre right



yes but tyrellian laser art is very similar in both form and composition
of course you know funny you should mention that i used to be stationed on tyrellia
really did you know that there are currently five tyrellians serving aboard the enterprise
thats fascinating not too many people know this but tyrellia is one of only three known inhabited worlds without a magnetic pole
i was aware of that but are you aware that tyrellia is one of seven known planets with no atmosphere whatsoever
really
theyre still at it
nonstop i have to admit it has a certain strange fascination how long can two people talk about nothing

is something wrong
i dont know i was just getting some very strange energy readings from your table here
im sure its nothing serious perhaps the heating element under the table is malfunctioning
maybe i should take a look at it for you
im sure we can handle this whatever it is commander theres no need to concern yourself
well maybe i should look at the heating element i mean in case it
its all right please dont worry
what was all that about
i assure you its all right well look into it you dont have to concern yourself
orton now

what is going on

stay right where you are

 reduce the plasma pressure to zero point six percent nominal
 zero point six
how does the conduit look
its clear
all right the main plasma flow has been shunted to the aft conduit were ready here
okay that should do it i think
 be sure neil
yes yes that does it all right transfer five hundred milligrams from the reserve system to the engine core

perfect
adequate disable the containment overrides and get the interlocks off the magnetic seal pomet prepare the transport assembly keep watching the power flow it might

keep working where did he come from
i found him on deck seven
who are you
my name is mot im the barber
the barber what the hell are you doing here everyone was supposed to be evacuated to the surface
yes i know but i wanted to go riding but i didnt have my saddle so i went back to get it and
your saddle
yes thats right its on deck seven i left it in the corridor and then the power went out and i got lost
all right all right shut up shut up any sign of devor
no
satler get down here and keep an eye on our barber all right go see if you can find devor make sure nothings wrong

sit down
all right just dont point that thing at me
just do what i tell you and you wont have to worry
how long until youre ready
forty maybe fifty minutes
the baryon sweep hits this compartment in thirty minutes
the field diverter will protect us
its not us im worried about its that storage unit i want the trilithium resin in there and secured before the sweep gets here i dont want to take any chances
understood


they havent tried to communicate with the outside
no demands no political statements no theft they must want something
orton is not as calm as he looks hes very agitated and nervous as if somethings gone wrong
it is possible that geordi upset their timetable when he saw the hidden weapons
orton may be improvising maybe he didnt plan to take us hostage so early and now he doesnt know what to do
if they do not have a plan for this contingency we may have the initiative
maybe but we need to figure out how to use it how is he
theres no permanent damage ive adjusted the optical transducer in his visor to block some of the pain receptors in his brain its only partially effective i need to get him to a medical facility
i doubt if theyll agree to that but maybe if we tell them geordis dying they would give us access to a medical kit we might be able to use some of the tools to make a weapon
perhaps we can use the visor as a weapon if the optical transducer were modified we might be able to generate a hypersonic pulse
a hypersonic pulse would overload the audio receptors of everyone in the room it would cause immediate unconsciousness
can you make the adjustments on the visor by yourself itll look suspicious if youre both working on it
ill try i might need geordi to help me through some of it
all right be as casual as you can let us know when youre ready

ready
begin draining the trilithium at one hundred milligrams per minute

neil whats going on neil get over here put that down

dont worry ive got it ill be right there




the primary inducer is completely fused theres no way to fix it without the diverter we dont have any protection from the baryon sweep
i know that how long before the baryon sweep gets here
about twelve minutes we should go to ten forward thats the last place on the ship thatll be swept by the baryon field
all right were leaving but were taking the trilithium with us
what do you know how volatile trilithium is we cant just start hauling it through the ship

ill ill try to make some modifications
satlers dead he ran into the baryon sweep
what about mot
i dont know but i dont think hes a barber i found this in the jefferies tube



kelsey to kiros
this is kiros
we have a problem theres a starfleet officer still on board hes killed satler and he may have killed devor he also destroyed the diverter in engineering so we have to leave here before the baryon sweep enters this section
what about the trilithium resin
were taking it with us to ten forward there should be enough time before
kelsey dont be a fool

you know better than to try and move trilithium resin
mister mot or should i call you lieutenant lieutenant commander perhaps
you may call me whatever you wish

moving trilithium resin requires very specific equipment you cant simply improvise something

i wouldnt need to improvise if you hadnt damaged our field diverter but if youre so concerned about the trilithium

i suggest you stop interfering with us

before you set off an explosion that would destroy the enterprise and you

i would rather destroy the ship than allow that material to fall into the hands of terrorists

what makes you think im a terrorist

trilithium resin is a highly toxic waste product produced by our engines

its only possible use could be as a weapon
you might be right mister mot but weve been planning this for a long time and i doubt that youll really be able to stop us

or even slow us down

there three hundred milligrams of trilithium im using a dynamic stabiliser to act as a control rod there that should keep the resin stable enough for transport
come on dont be so tense neil if something goes wrong you wont have time to worry about it lets go


three more decks then we take corridor fifteen b all the way to ten forward

whats wrong
we have to find another way up the rungs are cut


that wasnt very clever mister mot

if you knew where we were you should have attacked us now well just take another route one you might not be able

to predict
there are only so many ways to ten forward ten forward is the logical place to be if you want to stay ahead of the baryon sweep

that sweep is just as big a threat to you as it is to us in fact if i were you mister mot

id be trying to find a way off this ship

i plan on leaving the same way you do on your ship

what ship
come on kelsey

if youve been planning this so long you must have a way of getting off the enterprise and leaving this system i think you have a ship coming for you i plan to be on it

its a small ship mot i dont think theres going to be room for both of us

im sorry to hear that ill send your regrets

how is he doctor
hes in a lot of pain but i think he should be fine he needs some water is that all right

 were almost ready when we set the visor to emit the hypersonic pulse therell be a short burst of light we need a distraction

 they need a distraction
how long
just a few seconds
i think i can distract orton for a few seconds
i dont think ortons in a talking mood will
you just have to know how to talk to him orton i think we need to discuss the situation
there is nothing to discuss sit down
theres a lot to discuss cant we be reasonable
i am not interested in hearing your hostage negotiation tactics commander
it cant hurt you to listen can it
all right
thank you now the first thing i think we need to discuss is this




hold it put your weapon down kelsey this is kiros im on deck ten

i have mott
is he alive
yes
good meet us at intersection forty one
understood

this way move

give me the trilithium
how much farther do we have to go
not far with all the modifications youve made to this unit are we going to have any troubles removing the trilithium
no just remove the control rod drain the unit there shouldnt be any problem
thats all i wanted to know


well not as clever as you thought wheres pomet
he shot him with some kind of an arrow
hes not dead
well he will be soon the sweeps nearly here we dont have time to go back for him
what about neil
the sweep got him lets go

i thought you were just going to talk to him
i did he just didnt like what i had to say

that was a perimeter warning from the remmler array a small ship is approaching i believe mister orton has dropped his defence shields
this must be the sign they were waiting for mister data you will be the only one unaffected by the hypersonic burst as soon as every else is unconscious i need you to get to the computer panel and stop that ship somehow
i will try sir
now


kelsey perhaps we can work out a deal
youre the only one who needs a deal mot
my name isnt mot its jeanluc picard
captain picard this is all beginning to make sense
leave the trilithium here and take me with you you can use me as a hostage instead of threatening
im not a terrorist captain nor do i have a political agenda although i know some people who do have agendas and they are very interested in this little container
profit this is all about profit
i prefer to think of it as commerce open the door now go through slowly


i guess ill be the one to send your regrets

picard to arkaria base deactivate the baryon sweep arkaria base this is captain picard on board the enterprise deactivate the baryon sweep

arkaria base this is captain picard deactivate the baryon sweep immediately

data to captain picard do you read me sir
picard here


are you all right captain

yes mister data
sir an unidentified

scout ship has just beamed someone off the enterprise

do you know anything about it
i know they wont get very far


hold still you have got a nasty little cut here
any luck
im sorry captain i dont know what could have happened to it
hold still i cant heal this cleanly if you dont stop fidgeting
ive had three security teams search deck seven they couldnt find anything
there

i found it someone put it in a maintenance locker
thank you
captain you keep a saddle on board
mister worf im surprised at you
anyone who is an experienced rider naturally has his own saddle
its perfectly normal
actually it came in handy i only wish id had the opportunity to use it on a horse
of course
lessons


good evening mister data
actually good morning sir ship status is
no need to report im just here to do some work on my own
aye sir
id like to talk to doctor mowray at his archaeological site on landris two could you put it through to my ready room
im sorry sir but stellar cartography has requested a communications blackout while they run an experiment
how long will it be
another three hours twenty two minutes sir i can override it if necessary
no its not important
aye sir

computer display the latest excavation schematics on landris two
library computer is temporarily offline
explain
library systems have been allocated to stellar cartography
tea earl grey hot
replicator systems are offline at the request of
stellar cartography
what could they possibly be doing down there


in or out just close that door and dont move itll take a second for our eyes to readjust okay levate to three point two marquez
now at three point two commander
good good we can do this no no no were losing vertical alignment compensate compensate
compensating
gently gently marquez dont bump it no no wait hit the oh forget it forget it lights whoever you are you just ruined four hours of work
you might have taken the simple precaution of locking the door
its three oclock in the morning captain picard
i assume that you must be lieutenant commander daren
yes sir im sorry its just we werent expecting anybody to be up at this hour
well youre new on the enterprise youll have to learn to expect the unexpected
thats why i put in for this assignment sir
excellent now perhaps you can tell me what was so important that it required depriving the captain of his cup of earl grey
earl grey no wonder you cant sleep computer bring replicators back online and give me a cup of daren herbal tea blend number three hot you shouldnt be drinking a stimulant at this time of night i think youll like this

ive programmed seven other blends into the replicator youre bound to like one of them
i look forward to sampling them
im sorry if the system blackouts we requested inconvenienced you were taking very precise gravimetric readings it wouldnt have taken much to throw them off
what were the readings for
im trying to construct a mathematical model of an emerging star system if it works well be able to predict the configuration of a star system that wont be formed for another two million years
a long time to wait to see if youre right
i have a few things to do between now and then

captain well be arriving at the borgolis nebula in three hours
yes i understand it has unusual radioactive emissions and im sure that stellar sciences will find it a most interesting study
commander daren has already requested extra time on the main sensor array
well you have the bridge number one
captain i would like to remind you of our concert this evening in ten forward we will perform chopins trio in g minor
ill be there


and so the upshot is that well be close enough for you to slip away for a few days and see wesley
oh thats wonderful thank you jeanluc this is delicious what is it
its an herbal tea blend i er found it in the replicator files have you met any of the new crewmembers who came aboard at starbase two eighteen
in fact i have a new nurse beck hes an obstetrics specialist
i met the new head of stellar sciences last night lieutenant commander daren
yes nella daren she came into sickbay for her physical last week i like her very forthright
did you know it is now possible to predict the configuration of a star system which wont be formed for another two million years
really no i didnt
its really quite intriguing the whole thing is made possible by a complex mathematical construct based on fractal particle motion but thats only the foundation the modeling itself is done by gravimetric wave input
i see
well i know this is all pretty dry stuff stellar cartography isnt everybodys cup of tea
im sure its really quite fascinating
you know wed should be getting along to ten forward were going to be late for the concert


thank you
well done mister data well done
commander that was a remarkable performance
you are very talented
thank you
i noticed that the applause this evening exceeded average decibel levels
i guess that means they enjoyed themselves
i think that much was obvious
excuse me i have not yet congratulated ensign cheney
ill go with you
commander you must have been playing since you were young i played the piano for a while when i was small but i didnt put in the practice you must have
practising was never my problem in fact my parents had to make me go out and play
i wanted to ask during the second arpeggio in the first movement i noticed that you played an f minor chord instead of a diminished d
youre a musician whats your instrument we should play some time
no no no im just an amateur but your choice in that arpeggio was delightful not at all what one would expect
well captain now that im on your ship maybe you should start expecting the unexpected


excuse me sir i was hoping that my people in spectral analysis could have another few hours on the main sensor array
im sorry the array has already been allocated to engineering theyre running some warp field tests
if we go offline now well lose the gas flow pattern weve been tracking
i understand but there are other departments waiting to use the array
were at a critical juncture sir
commander ill see what i can do to find you some more time tomorrow
tomorrow tomorrow thank you sir


computer pause playback come oh commander daren
i hope you dont mind me dropping by like this
no please come in im delighted
what kind of flute is that
its ressikan
ive never saw one before
theyre not made anymore
have you been playing long
er yes a long time
id love to hear you play sometime
im not very good
that doesnt matter as long as you enjoy it
yes but i wouldnt want to inflict it on someone else
may i try
yes of course yes youre not holding it quite right may i
please

youre better than you think really we should play together
there isnt a piano
ah but there is

i picked it up on mataline two its amazing

that is remarkable why dont you play something
you start and ill jump in
what shall we play
what were you working on before i came in
bach the third brandenburg
perfect go ahead

im sorry
its all right youre not used to playing with anyone are you
just the computer
i may not be as precise as a computer but i think youll enjoy it more why dont we start with something a little simpler how about

good very good now lets have a little fun with it

you try it improvise around the melody anything you want

thats wonderful keep going its so good

youre definitely better than you think

number one my fencing partners cancelled for this afternoon i was wondering if you wanted to join me
fencing im really not very good
it doesnt matter so as long as you enjoy it
why not
good excellent fourteen hundred hours then

you have a mild strain
ive been playing the piano a lot i guess the captain and i overdid it a little last night
the captain
yes he plays a kind of flute a ressikan i think he said
yes but i didnt know he played duets
he never did before he seemed to enjoy it hes actually quite promising
i see
tell me have you known him long
yes a very long time
he seems somewhat isolated
id say hes a very private person but not isolated there that should help
that feels much better thank you
good
i was afraid i might have to cancel
another duet


keep climbing
where are we going
were almost there
i dont see why we couldnt just practice in my quarters

do you know where we are
yes this is the fourth intersect in jefferies tube twenty five
no this is the most acoustically perfect spot on the ship

the intersection acts as a resonance chamber
how did you find it
a little exploring
you mean to say you climbed through every tube on the ship
well not every one try it see how it sounds

thats beautiful what is it
its an old folk melody
ive never heard you play with such feeling



is there a problem geordi
i hear music
music i do not hear anything
are you sure i know i heard something oh its stopped


id heard about kerelian tenors all my life but nothing couldve prepared me for this mans voice soaring incredible range wonderful
i understand there are nuances that only kerelians can pick up we just dont have the ears for it

i should be finished with my survey by eleven hundred hours
very good commander

captain the federation outpost on bersallis three reports that they are entering a period of fire storm activity
bersallin fire storms happen on seven year cycle theyre not expecting any for another eight months
we dont rendezvous with the havana for another two days thatll give us plenty of opportunity to study this phenomenon
helm set course for bersallis three warp five
aye sir
counsellor could i speak with you in my ready room you have the bridge number one

sit down counsellor i want to talk to you about a matter of protocol i know there are no starfleet regulations about a captain becoming involved with a fellow officer but
you would like my opinion about you and commander daren
its that obvious
in a way that pleases people who care about your happiness yes it is
but i have to be concerned about more than my own happiness
and you think that your feelings toward nella could change the way you function as captain
yes relationships with coworkers can be fraught with consequences
thats true but cutting yourself off from your feelings can carry consequences that are just as serious
you seem ive always believed that becoming involved with someone under my command would compromise my objectivity and yet
captain are you asking my permission
if i were would you give it
yes

come in
nella
can i help you sir
im really very sorry about what happened in the turbolift when the crewmember walked in i felt very selfconscious its going to take a while for me to get used to the idea of crew seeing the two of us together
i understand im glad you told me for a minute there i thought id misread you one kiss and youre off to find somebody else
i can assure you that im not given to casual relationships  there is something that i want to tell you but not here

do you remember that folk melody i played for you this morning
yes
i learned it on a planet called kataan
never heard of it
no im not surprised its sun went nova more than a thousand years ago
i dont understand
the enterprise encountered a probe that had been sent from the planet before it was destroyed it had scanned me and i lost consciousness and in the space of twenty five minutes i lived a lifetime on that planet i had a wife and children and a grandchild and it was absolutely real to me when i awoke all that i had left of that life there was the flute that i had taught myself to play
why are you telling me this
because i want you to understand what my music means to me and what it means for me to be able to share it with someone
thank you


hello
sir
commander i was hoping to talk to you about ensign cabots transfer
quantum mechanics doesnt want to give him up
but he wants to come to my department
how do you know that
i offered it to him
transfers are to be approved by me before any offers are made
im sorry we were just talking and
its all right but cabot should stay where he is
commander please dont make that decision final i realise i shouldnt have made the offer but hes perfect for the job and quantum mechanics is over staffed anyway
commander do you realise the position youre putting me in
well i think im just doing what any good department head would do trying to build the best staff i can
look ill review the situation and let you know as soon as i can

come
may i have a minute
yes of course come in number one
its about lieutenant commander daren as a department head she comes to me for systems allocation personnel transfers things like that im beginning to feel uncomfortable with her requests
because of her relationship with me
yes sir
are her requests unusual
no
would you say that shes just trying to do her job
yes sir
then let her do it and feel free to do yours ships resources are your responsibility ive always had absolute confidence in your judgment
thank you sir


i cant believe im going to get the chance to study the fire storms on bersallis apparently theyre generated by particle emissions from the bersallin sun they cause a cascade effect in the planets atmosphere that oh im boring you
no no no youre not its just that commander riker came to talk to me this afternoon about you
about the personnel transfer i thought he looked uncomfortable he thought i was asking for special treatment  i was just doing what i thought was best for my department
thats what i told him but we have to be careful obviously its easy for people to misunderstand
i dont like the thought of having to secondguess people all the time if i have to worry about what people are thinking about me ill be concentrating on the wrong thing and i wont be as effective an officer
all im saying is that its something we have to be aware of but you mustnt compromise yourself you must do what you have to do because if i find that my head of stellar sciences isnt being effective then i shall do what i must to do and i shall replace her
noted sir
now i think that we should just forget about this and enjoy out evening
what about that special dessert you promised me
right now this is something that i first tasted on thelka four
bridge to captain
go ahead mister worf
bersallis three reports that the storm has changed its speed and heading they are predicting it will hit the outpost within eight hours and are requesting evacuation
im on my way
captains log stardate  we have entered the bersallis star system and are making preparations to evacuate the federation outpost on the third planet

a fire storm can kick up winds of over two hundred kilometres per hour and temperatures as high as three hundred degrees c
incredible what causes them
they form when solar flare radiation reacts with high energy plasma present in the planets atmosphere
wasnt the outpost built to withstand the conditions
it was both reinforced and insulated but this is no ordinary storm its twice as strong as anything theyve ever seen the outpost just wont withstand it
well arrive about an hour before the storm gets there it will take at least two hours to evacuate all the colonists off the surface
i led a team of geologists to study the plasma geyser on melnos four we crossconnected a few thermal deflector units to create a protective shield against the heat
a firewall
would something like that work here
you know it might  the storm is approaching the outpost from this direction if we were to set up a series of thermal deflector units along the northern perimeter we could create a fire wall and deflect some of the heat the insulation from the outpost should be able to handle the rest
thermal deflectors generate a field approximately four hundred metres wide we would need to crossconnect six units and align them so the fields overlap
how many people would it take to set that up
twelve two per team crossconnecting that many units will be a little tricky once theyre set up well have to leave the units in place and transport our people out nobody would be able survive very long outside that structure
lets do it
the storm is going to interfere with communications everything will need to be coordinated from the surface mister data you will coordinate the evacuation of the colonists doctor they have nine patients in the outpost infirmary your first priority will be to get them to sickbay after that you will stay on board the enterprise be ready to receive casualties marquez you will take some people down and track the storm all the other teams will need to be kept apprised of its heading commander youre in charge of deploying the deflectors lets go
commander daren about these thermal deflectors

there must be one of any number of people could coordinate their deployment
i assume commander riker chose me because im the best person for the job didnt we agree not to let our relationship get in the way of our work ill be all right

lieutenant marquez has already set up on the surface apparently the storm is still gaining speed hes estimating

itll hit the colony in less than fifty minutes ensign make sure you maintain a continuous transporter lock on all away team personnel we may have to pull them out in a hurry
yes sir
i dont want to take any unnecessary chances if they get into trouble beam them up immediately
energise

mister worf how long before the storm reaches the outposts
seventeen minutes
la forge to bridge
go ahead mister la forge

the ionization from the storm is interfering with the transporters captain im compensating but its slowing things down a bit

keep at it mister la forge


riker to daren
daren here go ahead commander
youve got less than nine minutes before the storm reaches the northern perimeter
im here with team six were just about to bring the deflectors online
whenever youre ready
daren to perimeter team stand by to cross connect deflectors
standing by
activate team three increase your output by point two percent
yes sir
good good deng decrease nutation by point four percent good weve almost got it

crusher to bridge
go ahead doctor


we just brought aboard the last of the infirmary patients and theyre on their way to sickbay but we still have over

a hundred colonists down there
understood
daren to commander riker
riker here go ahead
weve got a problem were having trouble keeping the deflectors cross connected so the only way this is going to work is if we calibrate them manually
if you stay with the deflectors will they protect you when the storm hits
i dont know sir for a few minutes maybe
picard to commander riker how many more colonists do you have to transport
seventy three sir
how long do you need
at least ten more minutes
captain the storm will reach the northern perimeter in four minutes
picard to perimeter teams

it is imperative that you hold your position until we finish evacuating the colony picard out

picard to mister la forge
la forge here
i want a signal lock on every member of the perimeter teams
captain the storms interference wont
as soon as the last of the colony is evacuated i want those perimeter teams out of there is that understood
yes sir


daren to perimeter teams the storms interference is going to make our job harder than we thought we may lose communication so its up to each of you to keep your units operational a lot of people are depending on us daren out

oh my god

the storm has reached the perimeter

i got out with the last of the colonists if it hadnt been for the perimeter teams none of us would have made it we were able to clear out four of the teams and the interference prevented us from getting two more i dont know how they could have survived
which teams are missing
three and six
the last i knew commander daren was on team six


bridge to captain
go ahead mister worf
we have found survivors sir they are beaming up now
im on my way


 thats it
here let me help up
thank you

captains log stardate  although we succeeded in rescuing all six hundred forty three bersallin colonists we lost eight crewmembers let the record show that they gave their lives in the performance of their duty

when communications went out i knew we had to fend for ourselves we modified our phasers to create resonant disruptions in the deflector field the disruptions formed small pockets inside the plane of the field and we each stood inside one to wait out the storm richardson didnt make it all deng and i could do was stand there and watch
im so sorry
dont dont say youre sorry
it must have been terrible
at first when you told us to hold our positions i didnt question it of course we would that was our job but when i saw that storm coming toward us
part of you must have blamed me
a small part maybe but in the end i was more afraid that you would blame yourself if i died would you have
ive lost people under my command people who were very dear to me but never someone ive been in love with and when i believed that you were dead i just began to shut down i didnt want to think or feel i was here in my quarters and the only thing i could focus on was my music and how it would never again give me any joy then i saw you standing on the transporter pad and i knew that i could never again put your life in jeopardy
if i stayed here you might have to
you could always resign your commission stay here with me
and you could resign yours and come to a starbase with me ill apply for a transfer
but we could still see each other people do we could arrange shore leave together and for the future who knows
of course  promise me something dont give up your music
the chase

captains log stardate  we are in the midst of the volterra nebula a stellar nursery our three week mission is a routine analysis of several dozen protostars in various stages of development

captain i have completed the spectral evaluation of the outer shell our survey of this protostar is complete
ensign lay in a course to the next one three quarters impulse
riker to captain picard
go ahead number one
may i see you in the observation lounge sir
ill be right there


oh my god
then you can identify this object mister picard
professor galen
computer lights up
i suppose i should say captain picard
professor galen contacted me from his shuttle an hour ago he suggested that we surprise you
to clarify i insisted and your first officer was good enough to accommodate me i trust im not being overly presumptuous now that my star pupil is master of the stars
no one is could be more welcome on the enterprise i never thought i would see a kurlan naiskos fifth dynasty
is that your conclusion mister picard forgive me again i should say captain
oh please mister will do fine well the overall configuration is certainly fifth dynasty the surface ornamentation
yes
green polychrome over the eyes and the eyes themselves are closed this is third dynasty from the workshop of the master of tarquin hill
well done
will the master of tarquin hill designed ceramic objects that were three hundred years ahead of their time all we know of him is the work his name has never been discovered this object is over twelve thousand years old
the planet kurl its a hell of a long way outside federation territory
indeed i thought your study of kurlan artefacts was done long ago
i happened to be in the neighbourhood last summer i couldnt resist go ahead
you mean its complete

will the kurlan civilisation believed that an individual was a community of individuals inside us are many voices each with its own desires its own style its own view of the world the kurlan civilisation died out thousands of years ago it is extraordinarily rare to find a figurine intact professor this is an incredible find
its yours jeanluc
oh no no how can i accept this
graciously mister picard you could accept it graciously
thank you how long can you stay theres so much to talk about
the professor is scheduled to meet a vulcan transport the day after tomorrow
two days but thats not enough time
we may have considerably more than that
i dont understand
i am currently on an expedition a journey into an unexplored and historical territory and i intend to take you with me
captains log supplemental its been over thirty years since i last saw my archaeology professor his presence has taken me back to a time when i had considered a very different career

may i ask you a frank question
please
your published writings have been sporadic for the last decade your appearance at symposia has been rare or scheduled and then cancelled at the last moment the finest archaeologist of the century is now shrouded with a cloak of mystery
and as a result my reputation has no doubt grown
ive never heard of anyone that didnt love a good mystery
the satarran of sothis three disdained them but as a general idea your statement holds
so what have you been doing for the past decade
are you familiar with micropaleontology
yes its the study of fossil records at the microscopic level i read your papers on the subject but that was years ago it seemed as though the work had stopped
no the work continued i made a discovery so profound in its implications that silence seemed the wisest course this work has occupied my every waking thought its intruded upon my dreams its become my life when finished and i announce my findings it will be heard half way across the galaxy
tell me
im cannot mister picard that information comes with a price your agreement to join me on the final leg of this expedition
for how long
three months perhaps a year if i had complete diplomatic access and a starship itd be a matter of weeks but as it is well have only my shuttle and whatever arrangement we can make with transports combined with our talents
why do you need my help in this
im not a young man there will be hazards along the way i dont want my own inadequacies to jeopardise the completion of this work
im deeply honoured that youd think of me but i have responsibilities
to history what if you could have helped schliemann discover the city of troy or been with mtell as she first stepped on yaseem how could anything compare
may i sleep on it
dream not of today mister picard
dream not of today the night blessing of the yashel
as i recall you missed that question on the final exam
well ive had a few years to look it up professor the enterprise is yours for as long as youre here
thank you
dream not of today


come
good morning looks like youve been up for a while
yes

lets hear it
i had a long talk with professor galen last night he asked me to leave the enterprise to join him in an archaeological expedition which could last for nearly a year
that must be tempting
i couldnt leave the enterprise but the offer raised in me certain feelings of regret
that you could have been an archaeologist and not a starship captain
no not really im not sorry for the path i chose but the professor did not choose this figure at random the many voices inside the one you see he knows that the past is a very insistent voice inside of me this gift is meant to remind me of that
and the exploration of space surely that must count for something
i wouldnt trade it for anything and i would still make the same choice i made all those years ago i just wish that i didnt have to say no to him a second time
were you two very close
i had a father but he was like a father who understood me and he had his own children but they didnt follow in his footsteps so i was like the son who understood him
and yet you turned your back on him
in a way i wish hed never come on board the ship


good morning mister picard
professor
the vulcan ship will take us as far as ds four an alleyan transport is scheduled to arrive at the station three weeks later theyll take us as far as caere and then well use the shuttle to get us to indri eight our first stop
professor im afraid i wont be going the enterprise isnt something that i can leave and then come back to if i go i go for good its not something im not prepared to do
this is not some undergraduate study project that youre turning down this is the chance of a lifetime dont make the same mistake twice
you dont believe that my career in starfleet has been a mistake
what are you doing at this very moment a study mission youre like some roman centurion out patrolling the provinces maintenancing a dull and bloated empire
we both know thats not true
i know this i know that as a scholar youre nothing but a dilettante years ago i gave you the opportunity to become the finest archaeologist of your generation your achievements could have outstripped even my own but no you decided to reject a life of profound discovery you walked out on me
i never wanted to become
will you come with me
i cant
ill be going
but professor youre not scheduled to catch the vulcan ship for another two days
theres nothing for me here goodbye captain
captains log supplemental we have completed our mission in the nebula and are en route to a diplomatic conference on atalia seven i must admit ive lost my enthusiasm for those proceedings

at our present speed we will arrive at the atalia system in thirty seven hours
captain im going for a walk in the arboretum i wouldnt mind some company
captain a distress call from professor galens shuttle on screen
enterprise im being boarded
transmission has been blocked
i have located the shuttle it is under attack
take us out of warp on screen
a yridian destroyer
battle stations
aye sir
professor galen is still inside his vessel sir his vital signs are barely registering
get him out of there
the shuttle is enveloped by a tractor beam the transporter cannot penetrate it
hail the yridians
they are not responding

return phaser fire disable their offensive systems

worf
i dont understand commander the phaser blast was not powerful enough to destroy the ship
transporter room one lock on to professor galen and transport him directly to sickbay
aye sir

he took a disruptor hit point blank there is nothing i can do

jeanluc i was too harsh

id say at least three yridians boarded the professors shuttle
what did they want
im not sure but it looks like they were trying to download something from his computer
when he was attacked professor galen began to protect certain files in his computer memory
we were able to partially reconstruct the shuttles computers so at least we have some of those files we found nineteen different blocks of numbers like this one

what do they mean
they could mean anything unless we can narrow the parameters of the search it would be almost impossible for the computer to identify the pattern with any accuracy
we tried every decryption key on record in case professor galen was using some kind of code we still cant make heads or tails of them
were the yridians able to get these number blocks
at least some of them its impossible to say know many
apparently the yridians knew more about the professors work than we do they may have known what these numbers mean
if they did that information died with them
not necessarily the yridians are information dealers they may have been delivering the number blocks to someone else did they send a signal before they were destroyed
no sir we detected no transmissions
and there were no other vessels in the vicinity
did the shuttles flight logs show where galen had been before coming to the enterprise
yes sir the logs indicate professor galen visited an unexplored star system ruah four
whats the distance from our present position
four days at warp six sir
the conference can wait set a course for the ruah system

standard orbit ensign
ruah four is a classm planet sixty seven percent of its surface is covered with water its landmass contains multiple animal species including a genus of protohominids
scan for earthworks or monuments that might indicate a previous civilisation
there is nothing to indicate former occupancy by even a primitive culture sir
then what was the foremost archaeologist in the federation doing here he left the enterprise in a vulcan ship for deep space four and then an alleyan transport to caere and then the shuttle to indri eight mister data what do we know about indri eight
the indri system was first identified by federation vessels nearly sixty years ago the eighth planet is lclass it is covered by deciduous vegetation unexplored with no apparent evidence of civilisations either present or past the planet possesses no animal life whatsoever
number one well proceed to indri eight
with all due respect sir weve already run into one dead end indri eight doesnt seem much more promising and were late for the conference on atalia seven
im aware of the federations timetable number one professor galen visited here a few days ago and he was on his way to indri eight when he was killed theres some connection between these two planets im going to find it
aye sir ensign lay in a course for indri eight warp seven


come
hows it going
i thought if i stared at these number blocks long enough then i would begin to see some kind of pattern so far nothing
i meant hows it going with you
if i had gone with him
captain you cant start thinking like that you didnt abandon him you chose not to abandon a lifelong career it was the right decision and in no way responsible for his death
i realise that
i know how much the professor meant to you and how much you want to find out what happened but staring at these numbers isnt going to bring him back the conference on atalia seven has been scheduled for six months starfleet is relying on your mediation efforts to
counsellor this is not simply a case of me taking the enterprise and its crew on some wild goose chase to purge myself of guilt and remorse i will not let galens death to be in vain now if that means inconveniencing a few squabbling delegates for a few days then so be it i will take the full responsibility

captain

we are about to enter the indri system sir
riker to picard we are approaching indri eight
on my way
sensors are picking up severe atmospheric fluctuations on the planet
assume a high orbit
on screen mister worf

some kind of plasma reaction is consuming the lower atmosphere
can we stop it
no sir the reaction is global
all life on the planet is being destroyed sir
why would anyone want to destroy all the life on an uninhabited neutral planet with no strategic importance whatsoever
all the life perhaps the professors number blocks had something to do with organic matter
if we narrow the search parameters to the biological database it might increase the chances of the computer finding a match
ill be in the lab

pattern match found
specify
the number blocks are mathematical representations of fragments of deoxyribonucleic acid strands
dna fragments
each from a different lifeform from nineteen different worlds
the planets that these fragments are from are scattered across the quadrant no wonder it took the professor so long to collect them but why
wait a minute these fragments all seem to have similar protein configurations they may be chemically compatible
but how can that be possible theyre different species from different planets there should be no compatibility at all
i know but look at the base pair combinations theyre uniform if im right computer connect the dna fragments according to protein link compatibility
what is it
i have no idea

this is not a natural design captain this is part of an algorithm coded at the molecular level
an algorithm are you saying that these dna fragments are elements in some kind of computer programme
i know how it sounds but theres no way this could be a random formation this is definitely part of a programme
this fragment has been part of every dna strand on earth since life began there and the other fragments are just as old someone must have written this programme over four billion years ago
so four billion years ago someone scattered this genetic material into the primordial soup of at least nineteen different planets across the galaxy
the genetic information must have been incorporated into the earliest lifeforms on these planets and then passed down through each generation
but why would anyone do this in the first place
and what was this programme designed to do
well we couldnt know that until we assembled the entire programme and then ran it weve tried all the dna material in the federation computer but we havent been able to come up with any with compatible protein configurations
then they must be from worlds outside the federation mister data how many people on the enterprise are from nonfederation planets
seventeen sir
you know this may be a long shot but we should check each one of these seventeen people to see if they have the correct protein configurations
ill begin collecting dna samples now
you know captain ive been thinking somebody else must know about this programme i bet one of the missing fragments was on indri eight thats why it was destroyed
to keep us from finding that piece of the puzzle its four billion years old a computer programme from a highly advanced civilisation and its hidden in the very fabric of life itself whatever information this programme contains could be the most profound discovery of our time or the most dangerous and the professor knew that

they all came up negative
well i have been through every page of the professors published works looking for some clue as to where to go next so far nothing
maybe weve been at this too long why dont we both get some sleep and start again tomorrow morning
i was in the neighbourhood when i asked the professor why he went all the way to kurl he said i was in the neighbourhood doing what
collecting dna samples
theres only one planet in the kurlan system capable of supporting life loren three
no there is no loren three sample from the data downloaded from the professors shuttle if he did have one it must have been taken by the yridians when they attacked
mister data set course for loren three maximum warp
aye sir

we are approaching the loren system
slow to half impulse and take us into orbit above the third planet
there is a good chance that our competition may be here before us battle stations mister worf
aye
we are now entering orbit
on screen
you were right captain weve got company cardassians
they are hailing us
on screen
my name is gul ocett identify yourselves and state your business in this star system

i am captain jeanluc picard of the federation starship enterprise and i see no reason why i should answer to you cardassians have no claims in this sector
i suppose not but my admittedly hasty estimate shows one federation starship and two cardassian war vessels perhaps i have miscounted
not at all but we are on a purely scientific mission you have no reason to interfere with us
and you have nothing to lose by delaying a purely scientific mission for a few days i invite you to withdraw
captain a klingon attack cruiser decloaking off the starboard bow they are hailing us
this is the klingon vessel mahtha what are you doing here
captains log supplemental it seems that we have not one but two competitors in our attempt to complete professor galens puzzle i have prevailed upon the cardassian and klingon captains to meet with me

i believe we all know why were here if we admit that then we can move forward
we were merely scouting the planet for possible colonization
pah a ridiculous story
what were you doing here then
scientific research
ha
look if we try to deceive one other then we shall get nowhere i think we all know about professor galens research and about the computer programme composed of dna fragments ill take your silence as confirmation now it stands to reason that none of us has the dna fragments necessary to complete the programme you were the first to arrive in this system do you have an organic sample from the planet below
yes and i will fire on anyone who attempts to obtain another one
as if we fear cardassian threats
i believe that one of you has a fragment from indri eight
yes and there will be no other samples from indri eight
what is that supposed to mean
he destroyed the biosphere of the planet after he had taken the sample
typical klingon thinking take what you want and destroy the rest
were all missing some of the fragments not necessarily the same ones unless we combine the ones we have we will never learn the secret of the programme
there is no secret it is an ancient weapon design of incredible power and the klingon empire will not allow it to fall into an enemys hands or even a friends
a weapon the yridian who sold us the information claimed that the programme would yield the key to an unlimited power source
but until we assemble it we will never know its purpose
hes right as far as we know it might just be a recipe for biscuits
biscuits if that is what you believe then go back to cardassia i will send you my mothers recipe
how dare you
myriap enough without cooperation we will get nowhere
what do you propose
if you each bring your samples on board the enterprise i will combine them with ours and then we will all observe the results simultaneously giving no one the advantage
and if we refuse
then this endeavour dies here in this room

captain

excellent

theres still one missing piece
pahk we have surrendered what we had for nothing
you are remarkably short sighted nudaq we are closer to the answer than we were
we may be very much closer indeed
how can that be we have no idea where to start looking for the missing dna fragment
this is a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces are scattered across the galaxy doesnt it make it natural to assume that the original designers of the puzzle should want us to find it why else would they have put the pieces in our dna and in turn doesnt suggest they would try to make it easy for us to find those pieces that there might be some pattern to their distribution
the computer might be able to find that pattern
doctor programme the computer to analyse the distribution of the pieces that we have correcting for changes in star configurations over four billion years then extrapolate for the missing piece
thats going to take several hours to set up and to process if youll excuse me
if you wish you can stay on board while we wait
i intend to


good evening commander data
captain
is there any word yet on the missing fragment
the computer is processing the data i will be notified as soon as there is any information
commander your reputation for physical strength is known even in the klingon empire you are familiar with the baht qul challenge
i am familiar with many klingon rituals including the baht qul

wa cha wej

maw tok

my upper spinal support is a polyalloy designed to withstand extreme stress my skull is composed of cortenide and duranium
i understand your intellectual prowess is equally impressive if i were to learn of the results from the computer search before the others the klingon empire would have a strategic advantage a being of your abilities would go far in the empire
you are attempting to bribe me
not at all
you suggested a plan that would work to your advantage one that i would be capable of executing you then implied a reward clearly you were
commander never mind


what the hell computer perform a level three diagnostic on the primary defensive systems la forge to captain picard
what is it geordi
you might want to come down here i found something that i think you should see

the computer has completed its analysis
the computer was able to extrapolate this geometric pattern based on the distribution of the fragments

computer highlight the section of the missing pattern the missing dna fragment should be in this system
the star is in sector two one four five nine the rahm izad system


direct hit on our port nacelle they are powering up for another volley
lets make it look good ensign release the inertial dampers
aye sir
they are firing

report number one
the power boost to the structural integrity field protected the nacelles we used the inertial dampers to simulate complete shield failure
it is fortunate that your engineer discovered gul ocetts attempt to tamper with your defensive systems mahtha status
minor damage to starboard nacelle we will be operational in less than one hour
what you incompetent topa you were supposed to be prepared
the cardassian vessels have set a course for rahm izad
well it wont take them long to realise that rahm izad is the wrong planet captain youre welcome to join us
i will go with you
ensign set in a course for the vilmoran system warp nine
aye sir
engage 
i am scanning all seven planets of the vilmoran system none appears to support life
how can that be the professors data depends on
correction the second planet shows evidence of an ancient ocean now dry
it once supported life
yes and it still may in a limited fashion not detectable by our long range sensors
lay in a course ensign full impulse riker to transporter room one

captain weve located a planet that may still support life well know in a minute
any sign of the cardassians
not yet we dont know how long itll stay that way
acknowledged

i am reading a small pocket of vegetative life a primitive lichen growing in a fossilised seabed
transporter room one i am programming the coordinates stand by


there over there
captain weve got company im ready to pull you out of there
wait for my order number one

you dishonorable topa
perhaps we could exchange insults some other time im rather busy now
well it was quite a chase wasnt it my friends
how
we intercepted several communiqus between the yridians and cardassia my ship was watching under cloak when professor galens shuttle was attacked
and you have been shadowing us ever since
and now the reward step clear please
i shall destroy the entire rockface and every trace of dna with it you will go back to romulus emptyhanded your superiors will be quite pleased
perhaps we could come to a compromise you give us the gene code
 the seabed it may be only partially fossilised it could still contain organic material
which would still contain the dna
i will not be eliminated now
you can be eliminated by a disrupter now what do you say to my offer
how can i be sure you wont kill me if i acquiesce
ive given you my word
etched in stone no doubt no deals there will be no deals as long as im still alive
do not press me klingon i dont care whether you live or die
if you fire others will also many will die

the programme has been activated i think its reconfiguring the tricorder
we die together brother tash koh tah
its modifying the emitter diode to project something

youre wondering who we are why we have done this how it has come that i stand before you the image of a being from so long ago life evolved on my planet before all others in this part of the galaxy we left our world explored the stars and found none like ourselves our civilisation thrived for ages but what is the life of one race compared to the vast stretches of cosmic time we knew that one day we would be gone that nothing of us would survive so we left you our scientists seeded the primordial oceans of many worlds where life was in its infancy the seed codes directed your evolution toward a physical form resembling ours this body you see before you which is of course shaped as yours is shaped for you are the end result the seed codes also contained this message which we scattered in fragments on many different worlds it was our hope that you would have to come together in fellowship and companionship to hear this message and if you can see and hear me our hope has been fulfilled you are a monument not to our greatness but to our existence that was our wish that you too would know life and would keep alive our memory there is something of us in each of you and so something of you in each other remember us

thats all if she were not dead i would kill her
the very notion that a cardassian could have anything in common with a klingon it turns my stomach
picard to enterprise
standing by sir
captains log stardate  our frequent use of high warp over the last few days has overextended the propulsion systems we are finishing minor repairs before returning to federation territory

its a shame professor galen didnt live to see the end result of his search
i cant think of anyone who would have appreciated it more
if it hadnt been for you his dream to solve that puzzle would never have been realised you left him a wonderful legacy
yes but it wouldve been a more fitting legacy if the message had not fallen on such deaf ears
you never know well i have to get this day started
both of us
see you this afternoon
riker to captain picard

incoming transmission from the romulan command ship
put it through
acknowledged

captain my ships are leaving orbit for romulan space until our next encounter
until then
it would seem that we are not completely dissimilar after all in our hopes or in our fears
yes
well then perhaps one day
one day

frame of mind



youre absolutely right doctor right now i cant imagine ever hurting anybody
how do you feel about that person you used to be
i feel terrible but thanks to you im doing much better now and im confident that when i leave i will be ready to take my place in society again
when do you think that will be
well now right away
why do you say that
you said that when i was able to accept what id done and i understood the consequences of my actions that i would be free to go
free to go you mean you dont think you should stand trial for what youve did
no im looking forward to proving my innocence
i thought you said you accepted what youd done
thats thats not what i meant i was sick when it happened i wasnt responsible for what i did
how do i know youre not just telling me what i want to hear perhaps we should continue this discussion next week
no i want to talk about this now
youre starting to sound angry again maybe you need another treatment
what i need is to get out of this cell ive been locked in here for days youve controlled my every move youve told me what to eat and what to think and what to say and when i show a glimmer of independent thought you strap me down you inject me with drugs you call it a treatment
youre becoming agitated
you bet im agitated i may be surrounded by insanity but im not insane and there isnt any there isnt theres nothing  m sorry could we go back to youre becoming agitated

no why dont we take a break for tonight i think weve made a lot of progress
im still not comfortable with that final speech
theres such a thing as overrehearsing will youre going to be fine
maybe im just not right for this part
most humanoids have the potential to be irrational perhaps you should attempt to access that part of your psyche
thank you data your character feels at odds with everyone as if the worlds against him
like my first year at the academy
yes thats what your character is going through but i want you will riker to relax
ill do my best
itll be wonderful youre going to knock em dead
right

you control my every move tell me what to say what to think what to eat what to say what to think what to eat then when i show a glimmer of independent thought you strap me down inject me with drugs call it a treatment i may be surrounded by insanity but i am not insane

excuse me

tilonus four didnt their government just collapse
its in a state of total anarchy when the prime minister was assassinated a federation research team was on the planet its believed that they were forced into hiding your mission will be to locate and to evacuate them
cant they go to local authorities
there are no local authorities the government is splintered it seems that there are various factions vying for power theyre desperate for weapons or technology of any kind apparently some of the factions have resorted to torture to gather their information well a starfleet research team would be a prime target
then ill have to go down there alone undercover
agreed mister worf is ready to give you a detailed briefing on tilonian culture
well i guess ill have to back out of beverlys play after all
oh no no therell be plenty of time for that we dont arriving at tilonus for another five days and besides if you back out shell come after me to play the part


this is the last known location of the research team they had occupied a small building in the southwest quarter of the city you will begin your search there
the southwest quarter covers over two hundred square kilometres thats a lot of land for one man to cover i guess id better pack an extra pair of boots
this apparel will allow you to pass as a common merchant this tilonian pendant is equipped with a communicator circuit
it doesnt really match the outfit
i suggest you pay closer attention commander your life will be at stake do you understand what i am saying
of course i do
because you will be posing as a merchant you will need to know how to use the nisroh for the traditional bartering ceremony

you will be judged on your prowess with the blade

i am sorry commander i did not intend
its okay i guess i really wasnt paying attention id better go to sickbay well continue this later

boy you will do anything to get out of doing this play but youre going to have to do something better than this
the plays not till tomorrow night ive still got twenty four hours

dont get any ideas i will see you on stage at eighteen hundred hours
right that still hurts
there was no damage to the nerves so you shouldnt be feeling any pain
probably just a symptom of stage fright

it hurts
he was working on a conduit on deck thirty nine a plasma torch blew up in his hands
it hurts please
hypospray
yes doctor

get me twenty ccs of opporozine treat the surface burns with the anabolic stabiliser
yes doctor
should we get a stasis unit
have one standing by just in case get me an epidermal sample begin dermal regeneration have tissue regrowth standing by i want him sedated

ive been on a lot of missions seen a lot of people injured but ive never been affected by anything like this he was looking right at me
and that was disturbing to you
it was as if he was blaming me for something this wasnt the only incident the last several days ive felt like everybodys staring at me or talking about me its as if i was in frame of mind
frame of mind
beverlys play ever since i began rehearsing for the role ive been uneasy and restless
youre probably drawing on feelings that youre not used to expressing
right the play is full of disturbing images people losing their minds being tortured by doctors i cant get it out of my mind
sometimes its healthy to explore the darker sides of the psyche jung called it owning your own shadow this could be a sign that youre a real actor this is becoming more than just a role to you
maybe youre right
dont be afraid of your darker side have fun with it

who was that you just missed him is there a new lieutenant on board
im not sure do you want me to check the personnel logs
no ill check them tomorrow im going to bed early the performance is tomorrow night i want to be up for it
im looking forward to it break a leg
ill try not to take you literally



youre becoming agitated
you bet im agitated i may be surrounded by insanity but i am not insane and nothing you or anyone else can say will change that and i wont let you or anyone else tell me that i am you may be able to destroy my mind but you cant change the fact that im innocent i didnt kill that man and thats whats driving you crazy
i can see we have a lot of work to do

no matter you can say will the fact that im innocent im not crazy im not crazy  im not crazy

bravo bravo well done bravo


where am i how did you get me off the ship
the ship again

whats going on
i understand this must be disturbing for you but try to relax tell me where were you a moment ago
i was on the enterprise in the middle of a play but it was here it was not real it was on a stage
i can assure you this is not a stage do you remember your name
im commander commander a second ago i knew who i was i was on the ship i was in a play and now im having trouble remembering anything
thats good youre starting to come out of your delusional state
delusional it was not a delusion i was there
we discussed this do you remember we contacted starfleet and asked them about you
no
we spoke with admiral budrow
starbase twenty nine he had never heard of me and they had no officer that fit my description
thats right now i want you to focus on who i am do you remember me
i dont know
im doctor syrus do you remember anything about where you are now
my head hurts somebody hit me
you tried to escape you struggled with one of the attendants and hit your head on a door do you remember that
yes i remember that now but i thought it was a klingon who had cut me with a knife
thats called transposition youre projecting elements from your delusions onto events that really happened but thats good there was a time when you couldnt break away from your starship fantasy at all
now if what you say is true where am i
youre in ward forty seven of the tilonus institute for mental disorders
why am i here
well talk more later you dont have to remember everything today youre making excellent progress

wait

good afternoon ive got some good news for you doctor syrus suggested that you might enjoy a couple of hours in the common area today well
i guess so

i hope youre hungry theyre serving spiny lobefish today
 you wont need that
thats what you said the last time




ill be back with your lunch

i hear youre a starfleet officer im commander bloom from the yorktown there are at least a dozen of us here maybe more we were kidnapped brought here against our will sanders was on the yosemite they did something to his mind i think theyre trying to get neurochemicals from our brains stafko was with me on the yorktown i dont know what they did to him were going to get out of here ive made a communicator
you have
yes there are three starships in orbit theyre going to beam us out of here any day now ill tell them to get you out too  lieutenant bloom to yorktown come in yorktown ive made contact with another officer
talking to your starship again jaya
no dont let them tell you youre crazy

you know youre not supposed to take utensils from the common area

youre welcome to try
im not that far gone am i
of course you are
your name is mavek
thats right not bad for a crazy man
i am beginning to remember certain things why am i here
i remember when they brought you in you were struggling screaming we could barely hold you down in fact just getting the blood off your hands took over an hour
blood
on your hands clothes you didnt just kill that man you mutilated him
what are you talking about i didnt kill anybody
im afraid you did you stabbed him they found you near the body the knife in your hand
no its not true
yes it is and if you get out of here youre going to stand trial
youre lying
i imagine the punishment will be quite severe considering you stabbed him nine times
no




i was there in ward forty seven just like in the play everyone thought that i was insane that id actually killed someone but it was all real
deanna mentioned that you went to bed early because you were feeling a little anxious about the play but i had no idea you said that in your dream we performed the play howd it go
it was a smash we got a standing ovation
lets hope it goes that well tonight well we have got one hour before curtain how are you feeling
i feel like an actor
well youre certainly beginning to look the part

perhaps we should continue this discussion next week
no i want to talk about this now
youre starting to sound angry again maybe you need another treatment
what i need is to get out of this cell im locked up in here for days youve controlled my every move youve told me what to eat what to think what to say

 and when i show a glimmer of independent thought
and when i show a glimmer of independent thought you strap me down inject me with drugs and call it a treatment
youre becoming agitated
you bet im agitated i may be surrounded by insanity but i am not insane and there is nothing you

whats happening
i can see we have a lot of work to do

nothing you can do will change the fact that im innocent im not crazy im not

youre the key to all this arent you who are you who are you
lieutenant suna sir
will are you all right
i yes i dont know
why dont we get him to sickbay

theres nothing wrong with you neurologically and i cant find anything that could cause the hallucinations but your heart rate is way up and your blood pressures way above normal and youre physically exhausted
this is not a case of simple fatigue
will you know that when youre under conditions of extreme stress the mind can manufacture all kinds of things
drugs they injected me with me drugs see if the drugs in my system
nothing
in that dream they gave me drugs didnt anybody at the theatre see anything strange happen during the performance
no nobody get some rest will the play is over dont give it another thought
right

hows lieutenant suna
a little shaken but all right
i feel like such an idiot
its nothing to be embarrassed about were your friends we all know the stress youve been under im sure everyone understands perfectly
commander i must compliment you on your performance this evening
oh
your unexpected choice to improvise was an effective method of drawing the audience into the plight of your character you gave a truly realistic interpretation of multiinfarct dementia
thank you
well maybe not everyone understands
i think id better get a little rest clear my mind a little
i want you to try a few relaxation techniques as well remember the ones i showed you a few months ago
they never seem to work for me
maybe you need another treatment
whats wrong
nothing nothing
will i want you to get some sleep ill see you tomorrow
okay


its not real its not real



dont let them tell you youre crazy




no let me out of here let me out of here help me  help me

i need help i dont want to be at the mercy of these hallucinations any more
so youve accepted youre not from a starship that its all a delusion
all i know is when i go back to the ship reality breaks apart nothing makes sense and then when its over it fades away like a dream but when im in the hospital everything here seems real and i remember everything that happens here
and what about how you got here
maybe i did kill someone i dont know but i want to know how
im glad to hear you say that because i just had a long talk with the hospital administrator he told me there are certain legal questions that have to be resolved relatively soon
meaning
meaning we cant keep you here much longer were the only mental health facility on tilonus four we have many people who need our help i dont want to put any undue stress on you but we have to settle this case one way or another within the next few days
what does that mean
youre facing a choice we can try to help you remember what happened using reflection therapy if its successful you would be fit to stand trial
reflection therapy
its a way for you to interact with the various facets of your personality we scan the regions of your brain that control emotions and memory and then project them holographically
and what is the second option
a complete synaptic reconstruction of your cerebral cortex
surgery
we would neutralise the synaptic pathways responsible for your mental instability
it doesnt sound like you care for that option
i dont the procedure is irreversible youd be left with a completely altered personality the person you are now would cease to exist
option one is beginning to sound better
i agree
reflection therapy then when do we begin
this afternoon if youre ready i want you to understand that this isnt going to be easy youll be interacting with aspects of your psyche youve never dealt with before and you may be disturbed by what they have to say


close your eyes try to relax clear your mind

now think back to before you came to the hospital but dont try to remember specific incidents concentrate on how you felt
i was afraid

terrified
she was on the ship with me
thats because she represents an aspect of your personality and there are many parts of you that still believe youre on that starship
why her
i asked you to get in touch with your feelings and this is the part of you that responded talk to her about how you felt before you came here
you said i was terrified of what
i was in a dark place cold frightened someone was there
who
i felt threatened by them trapped
youre doing very well now lets try to find out how you responded to these feelings try to focus on your actions you felt trapped what did you do
i was angry they were attacking me i fought back
i felt pain
i was injured
i began to panic
there was a struggle and i
you what what happened
try to associate your actions and emotions with logical thoughts what do you think caused you to act and feel this way
it was cold and dark because i was outdoors at night i was in a narrow place i was walking through an alley
i felt threatened
i was being watched
someone must have followed me into the alley thats why i started to walk faster someone grabbed me from behind
i panicked
i tried to fight them off
how many of them were there
three humanoid i only saw the face of one of them
what did he look like

i saw him on the ship too i also saw him here in the hospital but i dont know who he is
thats mister suna the hospital administrator you met him when you first arrived here
what part of me does he represent
i dont know
dont believe this will none of its real youre still with us on the enterprise
doctor
were your colleagues you can trust us everything will be all right
do you have anything to say to them
youre all delusions
do not listen to him commander he is trying to trick you you are in danger here let us help you
listen to me will in all the years weve known each other have i ever lied to you
no please leave me alone
will please
no

youve taken a big step today youve finally turned your back on those delusions and all that they represent to you well continue later


its not real

commander do you know who i am do you know where you are if you cant answer just listen you were on an undercover mission to tilonus four something happened we were told that you killed somebody but we do not believe its true were being blocked at every turn the hospital administrator denies youre here at all were beginning to think that theres some kind of a conspiracy going on i had to come in here posing as a health official sit tight commander were going to get you out of here

not real


commander
get away from me
commander you must come with us you are in danger here
no
silence


commander are you all right

help me help me

who are you take them to security ward


worf to enterprise the pattern enhancer has been activated three to beam up
acknowledged

theres damage to the parietal lobe its as if someones trying to access his longterm memory hes in a severe state of neural shock its going to take him a while to recover
number one do you remember what happened you were abducted during the mission to tilonus four you were put into a psychiatric hospital
its still bleeding
its minor dont worry about it
we have been checking on the hospital administrator
mister suna
it appears that hes involved with one of the rival factions we believe that he is responsible for what happened to you
it still hurts its bleeding again why you just healed it
will try to calm down
this isnt real

what are you doing will
if im right youre not really here this isnt a real phaser its all a fantasy and im going to end it no matter what it takes
but what if it isnt a fantasy are you willing to take that chance
youre right i wont but im going to find out whats real and whats not

will dont do it


hows he progressing
hes not responding to the reflection therapy his delusions are growing more elaborate
he broke out of his cell last night we found him running down a corridor claiming people had come to take him back to his starship
then i see no other choice well have to perform the synaptic reconstruction
i still have a phaser why do i still have a phaser
its not a phaser its a knife you stole it from one of the food trays give it to me we dont want you to hurt yourself

i dont believe you

if this is a knife what happened to mavek
its very complicated ill answer all of your questions but first i want you to put that down
no if this is a real phaser then i was on the enterprise but i fired it on myself so i should be dead none of this is real im setting this to level sixteen wide field that should destroy half of this building unless of course this isnt a real phaser



its all about you isnt it youre the only constant the only person in both places
theres a lot more going on here than you realise
this isnt real either whats happening to me
listen to me we can still save you but you must stop fighting us

youre lying
let me help you
no

im warning you
no



hes conscious i havent finished the neurodrain get him sedated

riker to enterprise
enterprise here are you all right sir
emergency transport get me out of here
captains log stardate  commander riker has returned safely from his mission to tilonus four doctor crusher has repaired the damage to his longterm memory

evidently you were abducted two days after beaming to the surface
i remember now i was in an alley they attacked me from behind i tried to fight them off with the nisroh worf gave me i managed to get off one of them off me but i think they injected me with some sort of drug
we believe that they were trying to extract strategic information from your memory using a neurosomatic technique
i was in a hospital then i was back on the enterprise i was back at the hospital i kept shifting from place to place i couldnt tell what was real
your mind must have created a defence mechanism that helped you resist the neurosomatic process your unconscious fastened on to elements of your real life in an attempt to keep you grounded to keep you sane
the preparation for the mission the play those were recent experiences fresh in my mind
you should get some rest we can talk some more tomorrow
there is one thing id like to do first

are you sure you want to do this by yourself the stage crew and i were going to do it tomorrow morning
im positive after everything that ive experienced i dont think i could sleep knowing it was still up

suspicions



all right come in

guinan whats wrong
i need a doctor geordi beat me in straight sets today i think ive developed tennis elbow
well youd better go to sickbay i think doctor selars on duty
i dont want to see doctor selar i always see you im very particular about my doctors
well youd better get a new one because im not a doctor on this ship anymore

three days on a shuttle to starbase twenty three transport back to earth i can hear admiral brooks now telling me how ive disgraced starfleet medical then a leisurely day and a half before the formal inquiry begins and my career ends
beverly my elbow
your elbow let me see it does this hurt
ow yes right there
thats tennis elbow all right here hold your arm like this
you know ive never been to a formal inquiry
well ill see if i can arrange one for you all you have to do is disobey orders violate medical ethics and cause an interstellar incident
well i guess that would do it

make a fist
do i have to hit you with my fist before you tell me what happened
it all started when those scientists came on board no it started when i got curious
well theres nothing wrong with that
thats why i went to the altine conference id heard about a new subspace technology developed by a ferengi a doctor reyga
a ferengi scientist hmm
his invention was based on metaphasic fields but his methodology was completely unorthodox
i like unorthodox
too bad you werent there nobody else would listen to him they all but jeered him off the stage but i had read his paper and his work was extraordinary
so you gathered all these scientists to come hear this ferengi
yes i hoped i could be a facilitator i thought if i invited scientists from various cultures to board the enterprise i could sit them and down help them understand the value of his ideas
like a scientific diplomat
exactly so after persuading the captain i had to round up as many scientists as i could from the field of subspace technology


but of all the scientists i invited only four were interested in hearing about doctor reygas invention and i wasnt altogether sure they were going to be compatible kurak was a warp field specialist on the klingon homeworld i dont think klingons regard scientists very highly she always seemed a little defensive doctor tpan is practically a legend in the field of subspace morphology shes been the director of the vulcan science academy for fifteen years her husband doctor christopher came with her i didnt know much about him but he was some kind of subspace theoretician jobril was a takaran the first one id ever met i had no idea what to expect from him and then there was doctor reyga the ferengi scientist
youve all seen my experimental data the metaphasic shield has been proven
forgive my scepticism doctor but your claims are somewhat extravagant protect a shuttle within a stars corona not even your own government believes it can be done
thats why ive invited you all here you have the vision to see the potential of doctor reygas metaphasic shield
i need help to develop the shield i am willing to grant exclusive rights to whoever provides the necessary resources
i think you all realise what this shielding process could mean the possibilities of exploration and research are endless
but only if it works im not convinced that this metaphasic shield can withstand either the temperature or the radiation it would be exposed to
but it has not only in countless simulations but in a field test that i conducted myself
for which of course we have only your word
are you accusing me of falsifying my data
you would not be the first scientist to manipulate experimental data to his own advantage
doctor reyga has offered to demonstrate his invention hes outfitted one of our shuttles with his metaphasic shield
i will take it into the corona of the star vaytan
that star has a superdense corona the shuttle would be subjected to particularly intense radiation perhaps it would be wise to choose a star of lesser magnitude
i agree my own research into solar energy transfer suggests that vaytans corona is extremely unstable
what better way to test my invention im not concerned the shield will hold
i for one would feel more comfortable if someone else flew the shuttle someone more objective
i will volunteer for that task ive spent years studying solar plasma reactions the thought of being able to penetrate a stars corona it is a remarkable opportunity ive studied your data doctor reyga i think youre on solid scientific ground
i do not share your optimism doctor jobril but if you wish to pilot the craft i would be more confident in your assessment of the shield than doctor reygas
i agree at this point we need an impartial evaluation
well need to be sure that youre familiar with the shuttles controls and doctor reygas modifications
im an accomplished pilot it will be no problem
well what do you think
i am gratified doctor jobril and there will be no difficulty in operating the metaphasic controls the system will activate automatically as you approach the star
well then well proceed with the demonstration at fifteen hundred hours well meet on the bridge
it wasnt exactly an enthusiastic response to doctor reygas technology but given the circumstances and the scientists quarrelsome personalities i was quite pleased
i thought that went well didnt you
thanks to you doctor
i didnt do anything

this is an opportunity i would never have had without you and i promise you ill never forget it
some of the scientists still seem a little doubtful but after the demonstration im sure theyll come around
well if theres anything im used to its scepticism after all a ferengi scientist is almost a contradiction in terms no dont deny it i know how the ferengi are regarded
i still expect the scientific community to be a little more open than they seem to be
the metaphasic shield is a breakthrough in technology many scientists have tried to develop it its only natural that there would be some resistance
you mean jealousy i know i wondered if that might account for doctor tpans attitude shes been working on subspace shielding technology for years and youve beaten her to the punch
im really not interested in competition all i want is to be acknowledged respected as a scientist this invention will finally do that
i figured the hard part was over id stepped out on a limb and it hadnt broken


not bad for my first venture into scientific diplomacy
captain the shuttle has been launched
on screen open a channel
i am one million kilometres from the stars corona proceeding at three quarters impulse i should reach it in approximately three minutes
the metaphasic shielding has begun to form
external temperature is zero point nine million kelvins and rising radiation levels are nearing ten thousand rads
that should have no effect on the shuttle cabin
thats right temperature in the cabin is twenty one degrees celsius and the radiation levels are normal
wait im reading elevated neutrino levels in the cabin
those are from the subspace field thats encapsulating the shuttle the levels are well within acceptable parameters
outside temperature is rising rapidly one point seven million kelvins
temperature is still twenty one degrees and the shield is holding
three hundred and fifty thousand kilometres and closing this is incredible i am actually flying into a star
congratulations doctor this is an amazing achievement
radiation levels outside the shuttle are nearing fourteen thousand rads
temperature inside the cabin is still normal
i am now fully engulfed in the corona its astonishing
you see doctors metaphasic shielding is a reality doctor jobril can you give us an estimate of the plasma turbulence

doctor jobril
somethings wrong
whats going on mister data
sensors indicate an increased level of baryon particles in the cabin
no thats not possible
doctor jobril can you hear me please respond
baryon levels are continuing to rise sir
i dont understand this shouldnt be happening
mister worf can you beam him out of there
the solar radiation is interfering he must be at least five hundred thousand kilometres from the star before we can get a transporter lock

were losing him
doctor jobril listen to me it is imperative that you turn the shuttle take it out of the corona do you understand me pilot the shuttle away from the star
the shuttle is emerging from the corona sir
mister worf get a lock on him as soon as you can
beam him directly to sickbay
at that point the doubts of the others seemed justified i had no idea what had gone wrong or how seriously doctor jobril had been injured but i knew this incident could destroy reygas chance to be accepted by the scientific community


twenty ccs inaprovaline its not working cortical stimulators now again
i saw the sun


so that was my first experience as a scientific diplomat a complete failure i dont understand
no
i mean ive lost patients before
but this was different
mmm
you know when youre a doctor and you have patients youre in control but when you send someone out on a mission all you can do is sit and watch
thats what i felt helpless
anybody would dont be too hard on yourself
you know what you say reminds me of something jeanluc said to me when i was doing the autopsy on jobril

it was probably the most puzzling autopsy ive ever performed and the most frustrating because jobrils anatomy was unlike any id encountered and ive run into some unusual specimens
hows it going
ive never run into a humanoid species like this before his internal physiologys baffling he doesnt seem to have any discrete organs at least not in the traditional sense practically every system is equally distributed throughout the body that kind of physiology should make him incredibly resistant to injury so whatever killed him must have occurred at the cellular level
do you have any idea what it was
no something caused a massive systemwide failure but i dont know what
were the solar radiation levels high enough to kill him
his exposure to the stars radiation was minimal its all very strange theres no apparent cause of death
doctor heres the result of the tissue scan you asked for
thats odd the rate of cellular decay is extremely low
beverly the answers will come
maybe even minimal exposure to the radiation altered the cellular physiology
you know youve been at this for hours you might think more clearly if you got a good nights sleep
i cant sleep i want to find out what killed him i owe that to doctor reyga
youre doing it for doctor reyga or yourself
what do you mean
youre the loneliest person in the world right now no one can say anything no one can do anything that will help and you think that it will never go away and youre right it wont but you can get used to it i know it doesnt feel like that now but you can
at the time i was too preoccupied with my problems to understand what he was saying i wasnt thinking about the rest of my life i was trying to make sense of what had happened

and i wasnt alone jobrils death had raised a lot of questions geordi and data were determined to find out what had gone wrong and they were busy going over every millimetre of the shuttle with doctor reygas help

run another diagnostic on the eps flow regulator
the flow regulator is functioning properly
what about the field emitter coil has it maintained polarity
yes doctor
the radial force compensator
i am unable to locate any malfunction all systems are operating according to your design specifications

did you find anything wrong
no i dont understand it there must be something weve overlooked
i found microcrystalline damage to the hull which confirms that your shield was breached by a burst of baryonic radiation
were the levels high enough to cause damage to organic tissue
i dont know
perhaps there was an unexpected interaction between the solar radiation and the metaphasic shield
no thats not possible i anticipated every contingency
then maybe jobril ran into something in the corona which you didnt anticipate and your shield just wasnt able to protect him from it
my shield was not at fault
reyga seemed angry but i knew it was because he was so disappointed everything hed worked for hoped for was slipping away

and that made what i had to do next even harder
im sure you all understand that in light of what happened i think it would be inappropriate to continue further testing perhaps if doctor reyga has perfected his metaphasic technology we can try again
doctor crusher please if i could have a little more time to investigate i know i could find what went wrong
but that wont bring back jobril will it
i do not believe the shield will ever work its very concept is flawed
just one more test
whom do you propose we sacrifice next
i will pilot the shuttle myself
im sorry as chief medical officer im responsible for the health and safety of all the people aboard i will not authorise any further tests
very well but i will prove myself
i couldnt help but admire his tenacity he just wasnt going to accept defeat and i hoped he would prove himself but that was the last time i saw him alive 
wed gone to science lab four when the ships sensors registered a sizable plasma surge there
look at this a plasma infuser its completely discharged the blast must have killed him instantly
perhaps he could not live with the failure of his invention and took his own life
or perhaps someone just wanted it to look that way isnt it odd that he could hold on so tightly to the infuser when it was discharged the normal reflex would have been to drop it
the plasma shock could have affected his nervous system he may have reacted by gripping tighter
ill know for certain when i do the autopsy
is your examination complete doctor
for now please have his body taken to the morgue
very well
i remembered his passion and commitment and his determination to prove himself and i was sure that this man had not taken his own life if anyone could understand that i knew it would be captain picard

jeanluc i was with him right before he died he was not suicidal
but by your own admission reyga was a difficult man to understand isnt it possible that he was simply masking his feelings
i dont think so he was disappointed at the failure of his device and certainly he was upset at jobrils death but i never got the sense that he was ready to end his own life and if thats true then someone else killed him
do you have any evidence of that
not yet but when i finished the autopsy i hope ill have it
beverly im afraid there will be no autopsy the family has already been contacted they insist that the body must not be touched until they perform the ferengi death ritual
but theres a question as to the circumstances of his death
to the family thats irrelevant
let me speak with them
please believe me theyre adamant we are scheduled to rendezvous with a ferengi ship in seventeen hours they will pick up reygas body then im sorry there will be no autopsy
jeanluc i cannot just drop this dont you see there may have been a murder
then you will have to find evidence some way other than an autopsy

i dont understand doctor isnt it pretty clear that reyga died from a plasma discharge
its wont be clear until after an autopsy as far as i know he could have been poisoned and someone put the plasma infuser in his hand after he died
you think he was murdered
im not discounting that possibility the point is without a complete autopsy theres no way of knowing for certain
why wont the ferengi allow it
it has to do with their death rituals the body cant be violated before its buried apparently the family is more concerned about ritual than finding out the truth about how he died i just cant get the information i need from a tricorder scan suspects if reyga didnt kill himself someone else did so who are the possible suspects
whoever had something to gain from his death
and the only ones to fit that category are the other scientists

im afraid i dont understand doctor do you have evidence that reyga was murdered
no but i cant believe he took his own life and i would like to explore any possibilities a bit further
what reason would anyone have to kill him
i was wondering if you might have any thoughts along that line
i see you are suggesting that i had such a motive
if reygas technology had been successful you might have been displaced as the preeminent scientist in subspace technology
but since it wasnt successful it is illogical to conclude that i had such a motive isnt it
i must say i resent this doctor weve all been shocked by recent events i dont see that theres anything to gain by dragging us through these insinuations
im just trying to uncover the truth and i need your help to do it have you seen or heard anything that might suggest that someone else had a motive
we are trying to forget the unpleasantness of these last several days not have them stirred up again i find it disturbing that you would try to foster suspicions among us
forgive me i dont mean to upset you but have you noticed anything unusual
i find your question distasteful
is there something youre not telling me
im sure its nothing i was in the storage room of the science laboratory yesterday kurak was working in the lab reyga came in and they got into well an argument
about what
i dont know i couldnt hear clearly until they started to shout at one other then i heard kurak say that reyga had insulted her honour and no klingon would stand for that i do not believe she killed him these were words spoken in the heat of anger kurak is volatile passionate but not a killer and doctor neither are we
thank you
i knew he might be right about kurak klingons make threats as a matter of course on the other hand sometimes they follow through

that looks like one of doctor reygas shield configurations
yes personal research
even though this technology failed
no one has denied there is potential in the idea
which youre now free to develop
are you accusing me of something
no but i want to know why you threatened doctor reyga
i warned doctor reyga that if he persisted with his slander he would pay the price
what was his accusation
i will not repeat his lies
were they lies
be careful doctor insulting the honour of a klingon can be extremely dangerous
did reyga make that mistake

i have heard enough accusations now i will have your silence
well youre going to have to throw me a lot harder than that if you want to get it now what did he accuse you of
sabotage
sabotage of the metaphasic shield was that why it failed
how would i know
did you sabotage the project
no i did not goodbye doctor
kurak refused to say anything more i wasnt sure if her silence was motivated by guilt or just klingon pride

i was beginning to find out that investigating a murder was a little more perilous than id thought and for everything id been though i didnt have any more insight than i did before i started

which brought me back to reygas body because the more i thought about it the more it seemed that the answers had to be there dna traces tissue anomalies a wealth of forensic clues that could shed some light on the mystery so i made the decision


come beverly
jeanluc i want to tell you something that you need to know but youre not going to like it i did an autopsy on doctor reyga
what did you find
nothing im sorry i know i shouldnt have done it
you most certainly should not i made it clear to you that the family would not allow it not only have you disobeyed my orders but youve interfered in the burial rituals of another culture youve put both of us in a very difficult position the family will have to be notified i dont doubt that they will react strongly if the ferengi government becomes involved as im certain they will this could have very significant repercussions im not sure how much i can protect you
you dont have to jeanluc i knew what i was doing and im prepared to accept the consequences
i could tell that he was terribly disappointed in me and that was almost the hardest part of all

so thats the story thats how i ended my career
backhand volley
what
thats how i did it geordi kept hitting to my backhand at the net
guinan two people died on this ship two lives that ended horribly and youre worried about your tennis game
are you upset
i dont know you tell me youre supposed to be wise
well if you are upset why are you moping around here why dont you do something about it
ive done everything i could think of it got me fired
do you think doctor reyga killed himself
no
do you think theres a murderer on board
yes
then why are you still sitting here
dont you get it if i start digging around again
you could be relieved of duty
chief medical officers log personal stardate  ill be leaving the ship tomorrow to attend the board of inquiry that means i have less than twenty four hours to get to the bottom of this mystery

what are you doing data
i am running additional diagnostics to make certain there was no permanent radiation damage to the shuttlecraft hull
youve studied doctor reygas shield system do you think it could have been sabotaged
there was no evidence to suggest sabotage
just consider the possibility
the system interlocks prevent access to the circuitry unless the shield emitter is active any attempt to sabotage the device would have to be made while the shield was in operation
the only time the shield was active was during jobrils test flight
that is correct it seems unlikely that jobril would perform sabotage which would result in his own death
i agree would it be possible to sabotage the shuttle by remote during the flight
a phased ionic pulse beamed directly into the metaphasic projection matrix would result in a temporary system malfunction
where on the enterprise could you generate a phased ionic pulse
such a pulse could be initiated from the lateral sensor arrays science labs one four and sixteen or any of the bridge science stations
lets assume for the moment that someone did send out a phased ionic pulse what would have happened inside the shuttle
a tetryon field would be formed briefly in the cabin temporarily disrupting the metaphasic shield
a tetryon field if jobril was exposed to a tetryon field it might have left residual traces in his tissue thanks data

beverly
yes
weve arranged for a shuttle to take you to starbase twenty three you can leave the ship at oh seven hundred hours tomorrow
thank you
about everything thats going on im sorry im sure it will all work out
yes of course
you know the inquirys just a formality and captain picard will do everything he can for you
im sure thatll help
but if you do anything foolish before that inquiry its not going to look good for you
i dont know what you mean
i think you do know what i mean the best thing for you to do right now is go to your quarters and read a good book if you do anything to make the situation any worse its going to be that much harder on you
thank you commander your concern is noted
beverly im saying this to you as a friend
yes will i know but as a friend please try to understand i cant quit now and i dont want you to become involved in this

computer access ships medical logs and download current autopsy files
autopsy files are restricted to active medical personnel only access denied
damn
doctor crusher what do you need the autopsy files for
dont worry i know im not supposed to be here ill go
computer access autopsy files
i assume youll need the files on doctor reyga and jobril
alyssa
i can see how important this is to you
i dont want you to get involved in this
is that an order doctor
yes
too bad youre not my boss now
thank you
so what do we do now
first of all i want to review jobrils physiology records then i want to take another look at the body i want to see if theres any tetryon traces
lets do it


we need to run a tissue scan at the molecular level calibrate the scanner to pick up tetryon particles
yes doctor recalibration complete
activate the scan
nothing
lets do it again use the enhanced resolution mode to boost the sensitivity
theres something in the subdermal tissue
narrow the scan field tetryon traces someone did sabotage the shield
thats a possibility but this is very circumstantial evidence
theres only one way to know for certain

captain im concerned about beverly ive tried several times to talk to her but shes been avoiding me
im not surprised
this entire experience has been
captain an unscheduled launch is taking place in shuttlebay two
no idea no ones filed a flight plan
on screen

thats the justman the shuttle reyga modified
open a hailing frequency

doctor crusher what do you think youre doing
testing a theory captain
a theory
i think doctor reygas shield does work
return to the ship immediately
im sorry
mister worf override the shuttles computer return it to the shuttlebay
aye sir sir she has isolated her navigational control it will not be possible to establish remote operation
get a tractor beam on her
i cannot establish a lock she is too close to the star solar interference is too high
mister data what is her heading
bearing two seven one mark four sir she is headed into the suns corona
computer begin monitoring external temperature
external temperature zero point eight million kelvins and rising
beverly what do you hope to accomplish
i think doctor reyga was right about his shield the only reason it failed is because it was sabotaged and im going to prove it
but you cant be certain of that youre betting your life on a hypothesis
im not wrong
external temperature one point nine million kelvins
sir the shuttle is entering the corona
beverly whats happening
im all right computer shield status
metaphasic shield holding all systems within normal operating parameters
congratulations doctor reyga you did it captain i want you to post security guards around the three visiting scientists one of them has to be responsible for sabotaging the first test i think if we
sir we have lost contact

crusher to enterprise ive lost you come in justman to enterprise come in

enterprise do you hear me come in
they cannot hear you i have severed communications
how can you be alive
id think after your autopsy on me youd know the answer to that
the slow rate of cellular decay
it is a natural result of physiostasis takarans can control their physiology at a cellular level we can create the appearance of death
in the morgue you were conscious the whole time you heard everything we said you knew everything we were going to do
move away move away
what are you doing
im sending out a transient subspace signal it will obscure the shuttle from the enterprise sensors and they will interpret it as a warp engine breach they will believe that you have been destroyed id like to thank you doctor
for what
all i wanted to do was discredit reyga so that no one would pursue his technology except me but you have given me more than i could have hoped now i can take the prototype itself back to takara where i will develop it into a weapon all i have to do is wait here until the enterprise is convinced you are dead and leaves


captain there is no indication of debris however the subspace signal indicates a warp engine breach
all right begin a phase one search starting with the shuttlecrafts last known coordinates plot a proximity course toward the star
sir we are picking up an object emerging from the corona
crusher to enterprise im all right returning to the ship and i finally have the answers ive been looking for
chief medical officers log stardate  i have been reinstated and i will be resuming my duties shortly in the meantime i have a personal matter to attend to

hi guinan

hello ooo somebodys birthday
not unless its yours its for you
for me whats the occasion
its a thank you for giving me a good kick in the butt
oh now i didnt er

i did some research this is the latest design state of the art its specially designed to cushion all vibration so you will never have tennis elbow again
thank you doctor this looks like a great racquet but er i dont play tennis never have
rightful heir



good morning commander
data interesting night
i found it extremely interesting the lateral sensor arrays ran three separate spectral analyses of the alawanir nebula on three distinct frequencies
sorry i missed it
i will have the report sent to you sir we are still on course for the gariman sector our speed is warp six eta thirteen hundred hours sickbay reported one minor injury in the exobiology department at zero four twenty hours
very well
isnt lieutenant worf scheduled to replace ensign torigan
yes sir i was not informed of any change in the duty roster
hes never late riker to lieutenant worf computer locate lieutenant worf
lieutenant worf is in his quarters
somethings wrong mister data you have the bridge security team meet me on deck seven section twenty five baker
aye sir

computer override security lock on this door authorisation riker alpha six zero


torva luk do shel torva
worf what the hell are you doing 
enter

captain
on your feet lieutenant
sir
mister worf your personal affairs are strictly your own concern until they interfere with the operation of this ship you have now crossed that line as your captain i want to know exactly what is going on
it is difficult to explain
try
ever since i returned from the carraya system i have felt empty
does this have something to do with the klingons you rescued from carraya four
they were young they knew nothing of their heritage so while i was there i tried to teach them teach them about their people their culture i told them our ancient stories instructed them in our customs explained our beliefs and then i told them about kahless how he united our people long ago how he gave us strength and honour and how he promised to return one day and lead us again
is that what youre doing here trying to recapture those feelings
yes i was trying to summon a vision of kahless
its a pity you didnt try using the holodeck instead of setting fire to your quarters
using the holodeck would not have been appropriate everything had to be real if kahless were to appear but all this was is nothing he did not come to me i gave toq and the others a belief in stovokor the life which lies beyond this life where kahless awaits us when i saw the power of their beliefs i began to question the strength of my own and i found it wanting
have you lost your faith in stovokor
to lose something one must first possess it i am not sure i ever had a true belief but i should not have allowed it to interfere with my duties my behaviour has been
inexcusable and understandable it may be that what you are looking for cannot be found here on the enterprise perhaps you need to immerse yourself in klingon beliefs in order to discover whether they can hold any truths for you is there something you can do is there somewhere you could go to explore your faith more fully
boreth the followers of kahless await his return there to klingons there is no more sacred place
boreth is only twelve days from here by shuttle as of this moment mister worf you are on leave
thank you sir
but when you set foot on this ship again i expect you to perform your duties like a starfleet officer
yes sir
and mister worf i hope you find what youre looking for
thank you sir


kahless i see kahless he is standing before me with a sword he wants something me he wants me he wants me to go with him
it is a powerful vision you have had divok kahless wants you to join him in stovokor you are only nineteen and yet your place among the honoured dead is already secure take him back to his chamber let him sleep

youre leaving us
it has been ten days koroth i have had no visions i have received no insight there is nothing here for me
what is the story of the promise worf
when kahless had united our people and gave them the laws of honour he saw that his work was done so one night he gathered his belongings and departed for the edge of the city to say goodbye
the people wept they did not want him to go
then kahless said you are klingons you need no one but yourselves i will go now to stovokor but i promise one day i will return then kahless pointed to a star in the sky and said look for me there on that point of light
so here we are on a world circling that distant point of light it has been fifteen centuries since he made that promise and still we wait what are ten days in the life of one klingon compared to that is the son of mogh really so easily discouraged you came to us seeking answers but this is a place of questions open your heart to kahless ask him your questions let him speak to you with your mind unclouded by doubt or hesitation only then can you find what you are looking for if you cannot do that then perhaps you should return to your starship


torva luk do shel torva luk

i see kahless

you are real

i am kahless and i have returned


what are you doing who are you
it is kahless
i have returned you doubt me who here knows the story of how this sword was forged
no one knows it is not written in the sacred texts
i went into the mountains all the way to the volcano at kristak there i cut off a lock of my hair and thrust it into the river of molten rock which poured from the summit the hair began to burn then i plunged it into the lake of lusor and twisted it into this sword and after i used it to kill the tyrant molor i gave it a name batleth the sword of honour
you know the story of the sword is known only to the high clerics it was never written down so that if he returned we could be sure it was kahless
i have returned because there is a great need in my people they fight among themselves in petty wars and corrupt the glory of the klingon spirit they have lost their way but it is not too late i have returned and i will lead my people again

vorcha doh baghk kahless
 vorcha doh baghk kahless vorcha doh baghk kahless


what is it you are doing
i was getting my tricorder
tricorder is it a weapon
no no it is a tool i intended to use it to see
to see if i was real proceed use your tricorder well
you are klingon
what else could i be
there are many possibilities a shape shifter a holographic projection
so you are a sceptic worf i like that
how do you know my name
we have met before i appeared to you in a vision in the caves of nomat you were just a child then i told you that you would do something that no klingon had ever done before you still do not believe it is me do you worf
i want to believe
that is a beginning


gowron is the leader of the council he commands the entire defence force if he chooses to oppose you
do not worry we are on the threshold of a new era for our people klingons from all over the empire will flock to my banner yet something still weighs heavy on the brow of the son of mogh are you contemplating yet another question for me after three days i am beginning to wonder if you know how to do anything else
questions are the beginning of wisdom the mark of a true warrior
do not forget that a leader need not answer questions of those he leads it is enough that he says to do a thing and they will do it if he says to run they run if he says to fight they fight if he says to die they die
if the commander is worthy of their trust
nuq chatak nuq

 what is wrong is there only anger and bloodlust in your souls is that all that is left in the klingon heart we do not fight merely to spill blood but to enrich the spirit look at us two warriors locked in battle fighting for honour how can you not sing for all to hear we are klingons yes let it out let the joy in your heart be heard we are klingons
we are klingons
we are klingons
we are klingons we are klingons we are klingons we are klingons we are klingons we are klingons
captains log stardate  the enterprise is to proceed directly to the planet boreth to take aboard a very unusual guest

did you take any other tricorder readings an anatomical profile or a neurophysiology scan
no
its going to be very difficult to eliminate any possibilities at this point he may be a coalescent being taking klingon form or a bioreplicant or even a klingon who has been surgically altered to look like kahless
there is another possibility he could be the real kahless he may have actually returned as he promised
the appearance of kahless in the lava caves is consistent with the stories found in the klingon sacred texts
worf no offence but i have trouble believing that the man i that escorted to deck eight is supernatural
i did not say that he is i merely think we should not completely reject the possibility
look we have no reason to rule out anything we are not ordered to investigate the origins of our guest nor tell anyone what they should believe we are simply to transport kahless to the home world and while hes here with us he will be treated as an honoured guest

lieutenant may i ask a question in the absence of empirical data how will you determine whether or not this is the real kahless
it is not an empirical matter it is a matter of faith
faith then you do believe kahless may have supernatural attributes as an android i am unable to accept that which cannot be proven through rational means i would appreciate hearing your insights on this matter
perhaps some other time commander i do not believe i can provide much insight at this minute

welcome aboard gowron
where is he picard
i assume that youre referring to kahless
i am referring to the filthy pahtk who is using his name
well the person in question is in his quarters at the moment
what have you learned about him so far

what kind of medical analysis have you made do you have any theories about his true origin
we havent done any analysis
what kind of fools do you have working for you picard the imposters been aboard for nearly a day
if you wanted to run tests on kahless you should have sent a klingon ship for him
and have him begin spreading his poisonous lies through a ship of loyal klingons never
if he really is an imposter then you have nothing to worry about
kahless has been dead for a thousand years but the idea of kahless is still alive have you ever fought an idea picard it has no weapon to destroy no body to kill the idea of kahless return must be stopped here now or it will travel through the empire like a wave and leave nothing but destruction behind

so gowron has come on board in order to test your claim
gowron knows that his days are nearly over now he comes crawling aboard with some kind of test
we do not have to prove anything to gowron
what is this test
he has brought a knife with him a knife is was supposed to be stained with the blood of kahless
gowron has brought the knife of kirom no one is permitted to remove it from the sacred vault
gowron does not care about what is sacred
he wants to run a genetic analysis on a sample of the blood and on you that should tell us if there is a biological match now if you agree to the test i will make the enterprise facilities available to ensure that it is conducted impartially
 perhaps it is time to settle the doubts of those who still do not believe i will allow this test


there that should do it computer run a genetic comparison on this blood sample and the tissue belonging to kahless
the genetic patterns are identical
but how how can this be
it is true kahless has returned


i am sorry our replicators do not do justice to klingon warnog
it has been so long since i have tasted any food or drink there are many things i have forgotten
kahless may i ask you about death and stovokor tell me what awaits us beyond this life
i do not have those answers i am merely a traveller someone who has journeyed back and forth between this world and the next while i am in this form i know only about this world and there is much work for me to do in this world and you will be part of it worf
me
it was your purity of heart that summoned me back from stovokor and koroth has told me about the respect you have earned in the federation and the empire i want you to have a place at my side as we restore honour to our people let me tell you about this new empire we will forge

it will be glorious
it will be war you are not a fool worf do you really think that every klingon in the empire will bend his knee and grovel before this man just because koroth says he is kahless
he is kahless your own test proved it
i will not hand over the empire to koroth because of one test
it is not koroth it is
of course it is koroth open your eyes koroth and the other guardians have always opposed me this is nothing more than a ploy for them to finally seize power even now there are warriors on my own ship who want to see kahless there are others who believe he is an imposter the divisions are already forming
but it does not have to be this way we could all join together and welcome kahless as a united people
dont you see this is exactly why they want you to join them because your brother sits on the council and your voice carries weight in the empire they want you to influence others to follow them worf we fought together once side by side to keep the empire from being torn apart will you stand by and let these impostors destroy all that we fought so hard to protect renounce him worf stand with me and we can hold the empire together
you do not understand kahless is our future only with his help can we revive the pure warriors within ourselves listen to him gowron open your heart hear his words he will restore your faith as he has restored mine give him a chance to lift your spirit and cleanse your heart before you take up arms

koroth i see that not all fools die young
kahless
kahless may i present gowron leader of the high council
kahless

long ago a storm was heading toward the city of quinlat the people sought protection within the walls all except one man who remained outside i went to him and asked what he was doing i am not afraid he said i will not hide my face behind stone and mortar i will stand before the wind and make it respect me i honoured his choice and went inside the next day the storm came and the man was killed the wind does not respect a fool do not stand before the wind gowron
what was his name
what
if you were really there you should be able to tell us the name of the man outside the walls describe him to us what was he wearing how tall was he what colour were his eyes
i do not remember it was long ago and in another lifetime what matters is i have returned to restore faith and hope to my people to lead them back to the way of honour and the glory that was once theirs and can be again is that what you oppose gowron
i oppose you i say you are not kahless and i will not bend my knee to you as long as i can draw a breath or pick up a blade

no
koroth

a good try gowron but not enough

you have no joy gowron is your heart so filled of distrust and suspicion that youve forgotten what it is to be truly klingon

kahless the greatest warrior of them all

everything will be all right we will say that gowron used a dishonourable tactic in his fight with kahless
that he cheated
that is a lie he did not
we do not need to hear any more from the son of mogh none of this would have happened if you hadnt brought them together
i am kahless i am the strongest the bravest warrior
do not think about what happened you must think of the future of the empire
there is no future here no glorious new era for our people gowron was right you did not know the name of the man who faced the storm you do not even know what real warnog tastes like and you certainly are not the greatest warrior of all whoever you are you are not kahless
you have said enough now get out
you are using the name of kahless for some twisted game for that alone you should die and if you do not tell me what you have done i will kill you right here
the problems with your memory are the result of the way you returned
what do you mean
we the guardians have been awaiting your return for centuries but we did not have the technology to bring you back until now we were able to use an organic sample of the first kahless to give you life
the first kahless
a clone he is a clone
what is a clone
a being created in a laboratory by genetic material taken from another being you are a copy a fraud
you are not just a copy we gave you more than the body of kahless
we found a way to imprint specific information in your neurosynaptic patterns we gave you memories and not just any memories we gave you the experiences of kahless as written in the sacred texts
so i did not do any of the things that i remember i was never at the city of quinlat i never went to the kristat volcano
you were not awakened until we transported you into the cave and you appeared to worf before that time you were unconscious in a laboratory where we accelerated your growth corrected any genetic anomalies that occurred gave you the wisdom and memories that
they grew you in a test tube like some kind of fungus and programmed you like a machine
you are twisting the truth
you talk to me of truth you who have brought to life this lie and called it kahless
it is not a lie genetically he is kahless and he is needed by our people you know better than anyone the corruption and dishonour that has destroyed the empire they need him
they do not need a false god
how do you know that this is not the way the prophesy was to be fulfilled who is to say that what we did was wrong
i am i will not let this fraud continue
worf you cannot tell gowron of this
do not give me orders koroth
all right but consider this if you tell gowron what we have told you it will destroy him  and with him the last chance to restore hope to our people its your choice


they have been sitting here for three hours seventeen minutes they refuse to transport back to the ship with the rest of gowrons men they insisted on waiting here until they see kahless again their faith appears to be unaffected by his inability to defeat gowron they still believe
then they are fools
does that mean you no longer believe this is the real kahless
yes
i am curious do you still think the real kahless will return someday or has this experience only deepened the spiritual crisis which originally sent you to boreth
i do not know
i understand your dilemma i once had what could be considered a crisis of the spirit
you
yes the starfleet officers who first activated me on omicron theta told me i was an android nothing more than a sophisticated machine with human form however i realised that if i were simply a machine i could never be anything else i could never grow beyond my programming i found that difficult to accept so i chose to believe that i was a person that i had the potential to be more than a collection of circuits and subprocessors it is a belief which i still hold
how did you come to your decision
i made a leap of faith


the man who appeared to me on boreth is not kahless he is a clone
a clone
yes
did you really think you would get away with this kind of fraud koroth i will have you and this abomination put to death
it does not matter gowron you will still not be able to stand against him
what hes not real you just said so
i said he was not the kahless but in the minds of our people he can be just as powerful as kahless even now two members of your own crew are sitting on our holodeck waiting for him to return
i do not care what they think
but hey are not alone like many of our people they need something to believe in just like i did something larger than themselves something that will give their lives meaning they need kahless
but when they find out the truth
it will not matter gowron despite the facts they will still believe they will make a leap of faith and there will be others just like them not everyone but enough to plunge the empire into civil war if you oppose them
what are you saying that i should just hand over the empire
no that would be unwise as well
then what are you proposing worf
you were right about one thing koroth our people are becoming decadent and corrupt they need moral leadership kahless can be that leader as emperor
there hasnt been an emperor in three centuries
the political power will remain with the high council kahless would be a figurehead but he will have the ability to rally the people to lead by example to guide them in spiritual matters
the title is meaningless without the power to back it up
real power comes from within the heart you would have the power to mold the klingon heart you could return them to honourable ways according to the original teachings of kahless which are within you it would be a great challenge if you have the courage to accept it
and what will we tell the people about their new emperor that he appeared in a cave or a laboratory
we will tell them the truth all of the truth but we will tell them that even if he is not the real kahless he is the rightful heir to kahless
and if i refuse to go along with this
then my brother and those who support him on the council will fight you and i will fight you and the empire will fall back into civil war
what do you say about this koroth
what i say is unimportant
it is acceptable

join with me gowron let us usher in this new era together
vorcha doh bagh  kahless

farewell worf
goodbye
whats wrong you should be proud of what youve accomplished
i went to boreth to find my faith for a time i thought i had but my heart is empty again i do not know what to believe
you doubt the real kahless will return one day you doubt that he is still waiting for you in stovokor kahless left us all of us a powerful legacy a way of thinking and acting that makes us klingon if his words hold wisdom and his philosophy is honourable what does it really matter if he returns what is important is that we follow his teachings perhaps the words are more important than the man qapla son of mogh
qapla kahless
second chances

captains log stardate  the enterprise is orbiting nervala four waiting for an opportunity to retrieve scientific data left there by starfleet researchers when they were forced to evacuate eight years ago


thank you thank you very much thank you thank you very much any requests tonight
night bird

any request
night bird
ladies and gentlemen night bird one two
what was that all about
wills been trying to get this piece right for ten years now hes never made it through the solo

here it comes
data to commander riker
go ahead
commander you are needed on the bridge
on my way saved by the bell


you wanted to see me mister data
yes sir it appears we will be able to transport to the surface sooner than anticipated
is the planets distortion field rephasing sooner than we predicted
no sir using the potemkins transport logs from the original evacuation commander la forge and i were able to modify the transporters
so we can beam through a higher distortion field
the transporters are considerably more efficient than those used on the potemkin eight years ago
thats a good thing i almost didnt make it off the surface when can we get started
ninety seven minutes sir
how long will the transport window be open
twenty six minutes after that the distortion field will rephase
that doesnt give us much time to retrieve the database
the planets proximity to its sun will create two additional transport windows in the next three days
lets hope thats enough
it will have to be sir the next transport window will not occur for another eight years when the planets orbit will bring it close enough to the sun to dephase the distortion field
okay notify the away team that were going in ahead of schedule ill tell the captain
aye sir


this is different than i remember the place was a mess when we left
commander
someone was here
a ship could have been caught in the distortion field and crashed the survivors may have taken refuge here
commander someone is approaching a humanoid forty metres due east and closing

who are you
who are you
im commander william riker from the federation starship enterprise
thats not possible im will riker
may i ask how you got here
eight years ago i led a team to evacuate this station
what ship were you on
the potemkin
why did you not return to the potemkin with the others
i was the last one out the distortion field must have interfered with the transport they lost their signal lock on me when i tried to contact the ship i couldnt get through the interference if you check with starfleet im sure they will have recorded that i was lost on that day
thats not what happened i was the last one out and i made it back to the potemkin
you dont believe me
its not that we dont believe you its just hard to see how both stories could be true would you be willing have our doctor check you out
of course
mister worf take him directly to sickbay and notify the captain once youre on board lets get to work
worf to enterprise two to beam up
aye sir stand by

looks like you fractured your arm a few years ago
i was doing some repairs under the station when an earthquake hit i got caught in a rockslide i had to set it myself
jeanluc picard
lieutenant will riker
i hope you understand our need to verify your claim
yes sir
genetically hes indistinguishable from commander riker
could there be some sort of cloning involved here
i dont think so theres no genetic drift
but its not conclusive
thats why i compared their brain scans brain organisation patterns are as unique as fingerprints except for minor minor differences theirs are identical
but cant brain patterns be cloned
no theyre determined by experience mostly from early childhood
how can two grown men share the same childhood experiences it just doesnt make any sense
i am will riker i dont know who or what made it back to the potemkin that day but it wasnt me
lieutenant our chief engineer is checking the transport logs of the potemkin perhaps that will shed some light on the matter dont worry we will get to the bottom of this and in the meantime you will be taken to your quarters try and make yourself as comfortable as possible
i will the replicators on the station havent worked for a long time ago its been a while since ive had a decent meal doctor

apparently there was a massive energy surge in the distortion field around the planet just at the moment you tried to beam out the transporter chief tried to compensate by initiating a second containment beam
an interesting approach he must have been planning to reintegrate the two patterns in the transport buffer
actually it wasnt really necessary commander rikers pattern maintained its integrity with just the one containment beam he made it back to the ship just fine
what happened to the second beam
the transporter chief shut it down but somehow it was reflected back to the surface
and another william riker materialised there
how was the second pattern able to maintained its integrity
the containment beam must have had the exact same phase differential as the distortion field
which one of them is real
thats the thing both you were both materialised from a complete pattern
up until that moment you were the same person
but of course as you and lieutenant riker have lived very different lives for the past eight years you are now very different people i suppose its a little like meeting someones twin but no matter how strange it may seem to us we now have two will rikers on board and as lieutenant riker will be with us for several days i think we should do everything we can to make him comfortable and welcome
we still have the problem of retrieving the database the computer on the station is not completely operational
many of its components have been removed apparently lieutenant riker used them to keep the stations radiation shield operational
can it be repaired at least enough to access the database
without knowing what he did thatll be tough
perhaps he can help us
he was alone down there for a long time im hesitant to let him go back until hes been evaluated
ill talk to him
thank you counsellor


come in
hello will

imzadi
will
i never thought id see you again
we need to talk
youre on board because of him
no commander riker and i are friends close friends but nothing more why dont we sit down do you remember the last time we saw each other
like yesterday the janaran falls on betazed
it was the day before you started your tour on the potemkin
and we were going to meet on risa six weeks later
we never did
i know
no what i mean is commander riker and i never did you see he earned a promotion very quickly
i know that too for exceptional valour during the evacuation of the research station on nervala four i looked at his service record
he chose to make his career a priority there wasnt much time for anything else we kept in touch but we didnt see each other again until we were both posted to the enterprise two years later by then our feelings for each other had changed weve served together for six years things never went back to the way they used to be
i had a lot of time on my hands when i was down on that station there were days i felt so alone i thought i might lose my mind do you know how i made it through i thought if i hung on for more day theyd rescue me maybe id see you again i guess things dont always work out the way you expect them to
i know this isnt what you were hoping for but that doesnt mean you cant make a future for yourself
thanks
captain picard wanted me to find out if youd be willing to help us retrieve the stations database
i reconfigured that computer so many times they probably cant make heads or tails of it id be happy to help
do you feel up to it
absolutely
good ill tell the captain well i have to go
deanna i know its been a long time since weve been together and i know your feelings have changed mine havent i cant just give up id like to be with you again
goodnight will



phase distortion is dropping the second transport window opens in forty two seconds
how long will we have lieutenant
thirty six minutes sir
we are losing time lieutenant riker should be here
computer locate lieutenant

cancel inquiry
you were supposed to report here at eight hundred hours
im sorry i was
i guess its been a while since youve had to punch a clock lets go energise

ive shut down most of the consoles to save power i rerouted just about everything through here
check out the primary eps system see if you can get some power to the rest of these consoles
i shunted the database to the main core underneath the station
can we access it from here
theres been a lot of seismic activity over the years if the servolinks were damaged we may not be able to ill try to tap into the command pathways you see if you can access and disable the file server

you know ive been thinking we should probably let dad know what happened
im sure hell be thrilled to know there are two of us now
actually he and i have been able to patch a few things up
ive been able to get by for a long time without seeing him im not about to start now what made you contact him
i didnt he came on board the enterprise to brief me when i was offered the aries
what did he say when you turned down your own command
he couldnt understand why i did it
for once he and i agree on something
the primary eps coupling is fused the entire unit will have to be replaced
ive accessed the command pathways the interlink pathways are functioning now
see if that did the trick no its not working
the servolink must be damaged were going to have to go under the station and access the core directly
we have less than three minutes left
ill stay here ill be finished by the time the third window opens
its too dangerous our scans show the caverns are unstable
ive been down there dozens of times i know my way around
well come back during the third window well bring a new eps coupling and try to access the core from another console up here riker to enterprise
la forge here
were ready to beam out
you go ahead ill be finished by the time you get back
hold it i gave you an order lieutenant

computer valerian root tea hot

 meet me in transporter room three at nineteen hundred hours its important


 it pulses unendingly all through the night seek out the crystal that powers our flight

can i help you counsellor

no thank you

 what the future holds no one can know but forward we look and forward we go


the janaran falls
i remember where did you get this
i made it a couple of years ago down on the station
you made this
you should have seen the first two it took a while to get a fine enough beam out of the phaser
its lovely thank you
can you stay and talk i wanted to remember our last night together
so how does it feel being with people again
great strange for a long time i did whatever i wanted whenever i wanted its been hard taking orders again
i can imagine
but i guess ill have to get used to it if i want to get my career going again
is that what youve decided to do
remember im the one who wanted to make captain by the time i was thirty five im a little behind schedule ill admit that
its good you dont feel set back
i do things are a little more complicated than i had planned but theres nothing going to stand in the way of my getting what i want
there you go
thanks you dont know how many times i thought about you about us for weeks after the evacuation i kept thinking theyd find a way through the distortion field and come back for me i even thought wed meet on risa like we planned but days went by and nobody came then i realised why they thought that i had been killed in the beam out no one came down because they thought there was no one to come down for so i figured that theyd had a memorial service for me somehow that made me feel better
i can understand that
you were there all dressed in black very flattering on you by the way
im sure i looked terrible with my eyes all red and swollen from crying
sometimes i would look up into the sky and id think if i tried hard enough i could make you feel my presence that if i could let you know that i was alive maybe youd wait for me i know it sounds crazy but there were times when i couldve sworn what am i talking about
the other day when i told you about how commander riker and i didnt meet on risa what i didnt say was how disappointed i was
you didnt have to i knew
i started to hear from him less and less i knew his career was taking him away from me but i didnt want to believe it was over i spent a lot of time thinking about him wondering where he was what he was doing sometimes id look into the sky and imagine that he knew and that somehow he could sense me thinking about him so who knows maybe one night we were looking up at the same star and you were thinking about me and in a way i was thinking about you

come
you wanted to see me sir
yes number one come in
lieutenant riker has been to see me to talk about the away mission he believes that the only way to retrieve the database is by directly accessing the main core underneath the station
the seismic activity makes those caverns very unstable in my opinion its too risky
he said that he was down there recently he seemed confident that it could be done safely
theres a good chance we will be able to retrieve the database from one of the consoles inside the station
but if it doesnt work we wont have another chance for eight years
lieutenant rikers plan is more dangerous but it does have a better chance of succeeding
given the importance of the data i think that its worth the risk
ill look over the schematics and ill draw up a mission plan
im sure that lieutenant riker will be happy to help you with that
ill talk to him

 sir
lieutenant
sir
i just met with the captain about your mission recommendation i would appreciate it if next time you came to me first
i tried talking to you yesterday on the station you wouldnt hear me out
i heard you lieutenant i rejected your plan
may i ask what the captain decided
the captain has decided to go with your recommendation but thats not the point
isnt it
if you think im coming down on you because the captain overruled me think again i happen to disagree with his decision but he is my commanding officer and i follow his orders just so theres no confusion i am your commanding officer and i expect you to do the same if you cant theres no place for you on my away team
yes sir
there will be a meeting in the observation lounge at fourteen hundred hours to draw up a mission plan


we stayed in ten forward talking for hours
then what happened
he walked me to my quarters
then what happened
beverly
im just asking
you know its been over between will and me for a long time
hes not will he is will but you know what i mean
its really hard for me to separate my feelings for them
deanna just because things turned out the way they did between you and commander riker doesnt mean you shouldnt let things between you and lieutenant riker take their own course
i knew youd encourage me
i thought thats that why you brought it up

well i think ill call it a day
 beverly

bye
some form of tai chi chuan
klingon exercises actually lieutenant worf teaches a class
the forms are very similar do that move again

you just did the kohmanara
tai chi chuan its called the crane block now lets try something else

what was that called mister worfs a very good teacher


hello will
if you want to be with him you dont have to ask my permission its the look in your eyes i recognise it you used to have it for me
weve both had relationships with other people this is different i didnt know how youd feel about it
flattered sort of
this must be very strange for you
ever since he came on board i find myself thinking about the choice you and i made
me too
do me a favour be careful
will i know you and he have had some problems
thats not what im talking about if he had gotten off the planet instead of me dont you think he would have made the same choices that i made i just dont want you to be hurt again

two pair
full boat kings over id like to thank you both for your very generous contributions

come in
i thought youd be alone excuse me
why dont you join us

the game is five card draw no limit ante please

lieutenant
three please
mister worf
four
commander
ill play these
dealer takes two you control the bet lieutenant
fifty
fold
heres your fifty and ten more
you didnt take any cards you must be holding something why not make it a little sweeter
no thanks
playing it safe
you in
i will call
heres your ten and it will cost you another one hundred
ive practised in the mirror too long to be fooled by that face youre bluffing heres your hundred and twenty more
dealer folds
i thought if one thing were clear by now its that you and i play things a little differently
why dont we wait and see who comes out on top
i thought you were willing to settle for second commander
ive never settled for anything in my life i know what i want i know what ive got and youd be lucky to do as well lieutenant
heres your twenty three hundred more
now i know youre bluffing
are you in or not
why dont we get this over with ill call your three and ill raise you anything youve got left well
take it you always had the better hand in everything

come in
hi im sorry to just stop by like this but theres something id like to talk to you about

captain picard made has some inquiries he managed to get me a posting on the gandhi and considering how long ive been out of commission its an amazing opportunity
when would you leave
in about a week
i see
deanna after ive served for six months im eligible to bring family aboard if we got married
you said those exact words to me before you went to serve on the potemkin
i know i was just held up for a while
but if you hadnt been what would have happened between us
i wouldntve made the mistake of leaving you i know that much
i dont know if i can believe that it took me a long time to get over what happened between commander riker and me i dont know that i want to put myself in that position again
i would never hurt you deanna
its not just that ive worked hard to make a life for myself on the enterprise im happy here
if the situation were different id stay but i cant not while hes aboard
i know
are you saying its over
no no i just dont know if im ready to give up my life here maybe we both need some time

goodnight
captains log supplemental the third transport window has opened and the away team is making their final attempt at retrieving the database

once we restore the servo link you can shunt the database up to this console are you ready commander data
youre with me lieutenant
i thought commander datas expertise
it doesnt take that much expertise to repair a servo link you and i can handle it

lieutenant i am curious about something if you met a double of yourself would you have difficulty interacting with him
i think so
why
i am not easy to get along with
but commander riker and lieutenant riker are yet they seem to have trouble getting along with each another i have found that humans value their uniqueness that sense that they are different from every one else the existence of a double would preclude that feeling could that be the source of the friction
or perhaps it is more a matter of seeing something in your double something you do not like in yourself


this is it theres the core over there
you waiting for something
your orders sir how would you like me to get over there sir
youve been down here dozens of times im sure you know the best way
yes sir i do

its leaking ion radiation
why didnt you report this
it wasnt here before this must have just happened recently if we have to repair this conduit we wont have time to access that computer core

scan it now
its working the radiation levels are dropping to normal
next time dont give up so easily

hang on come on grab on come on come on climb come on  im being pulled in
let go one of us has to get out of here
climb come on climb climb


they have restored the servo link to the core we can begin downloading the database
initiating data transfer
captains log stardate  we have retrieved the database from nervala station and are headed for our rendezvous with the gandhi

come in
i hear the gandhis going on a terraforming mission to the lagana sector
thats right itll take us four months just to get there
i wont be joining you
i guess im not surprised to hear that
im just not ready to give up my life here not yet

come in
im sorry
its all right
i wanted to give you something
my quarters are full of things that i suppose belong to both of us the least i could do is give you this

thanks
good luck will
i actually thought i might go with the name thomas
your middle name
i guess we really are different i never really cared for that name
well i sort of like it i guess id better get going

i waited a long time i guess i can wait a little longer  take care of her

timescape



oh you really did it this time will this is not just a scrape this is a very deep cut well i can heal it of course but youve got to stop playing parrises squares as if youre twenty one years old one of these days youre going to fall and break your neck and im not going to be able to heal that as easily
i wasnt playing parrises squares
worfs callisthenic programme
no
i give up what was it
i was trying to feed spot
datas cat
i told him id feed him while he was gone i was just putting down the bowl of food the next thing i know theres a hissing ball of fur coming at my face i hate cats
i love cats you know youve just got to know how to handle them
maybe youd like to do it
i would be honoured if i could
commander riker to the bridge
on my way oh by the way youll need this


report
we are picking up a distress call on long range sensors it is romulan sir
romulan
they claim they have suffered a complete engine failure power levels are dropping life support is failing it could be a trick
how long before we rendezvous with captain picard
approximately thirteen hours
lay in a course for the romulan ship lets put up shields and go to red alert i want to be ready for anything
aye sir
captains log stardate  commander data mister la forge counsellor troi and i are en route to the enterprise after attending a three day conference on the psychological effects of longterm deepspace assignments

computer activate automatic helm control
helm control activated


i was just leaving the reception when this ktarian walks up to me and says  hello diane i understand youre an empath im a very sensitive man myself im doing a thesis on interspecies mating rituals would you care to join me in some empirical research
thats a very good impression of doctor mizan
how did you know
hes notorious but he really is an expert on interspecies mating practices
did you help him with his research counsellor
absolutely not
i thought it was a topic you were interested in
how did you enjoy the rest of the conference counsellor
to be honest i was bored i spent most of my time at professor wagners phylobiology seminar i thought the idea of the seminar was that we would all participate bring different points of views to the discussion he gathered two hundred scientists from all over the federation and all he did was put us to sleep
i have a memory record of the entire lecture counsellor i can repeat the portions you missed if you
no thank you data
well it was little better at the physiognomy workshop doctor vassbinder gave an hour long dissertation on the ionisation effect of warp nacelles before he realised that the topic was supposed to be psychology
why didnt anybody tell him
there was no opportunity there was no pause  he just kept talking in one long incredibly unbroken sentence moving from topic to topic so that no one had a chance to interrupt it was really quite hypnotic
well i had a great time the warpenergy symposium was fascinating i actually had an opportunity to touch a plasma field
really what was it like
it was incredible i could feel the plasma moving up my arm it was warm and oh there was this amazing tingling sensation that

captain data
moved through my chest it was incredible it was like taking a bath in pure energy
it was not painful
oh no counsellor is there something wrong
im not sure

well our bioscans check out there are no physiological anomalies if something did happen it didnt leave any biological traces
how long did it appear to you that we were frozen
i dont know four maybe five seconds you just stopped and then started again i cant explain it
my memory record does not indicate a pause or disruption during that time period my internal chronometer and the ships computer are both perfectly synchronised there does not appear to be a temporal discrepancy
data lets run a shipwide diagnostic maybe we missed something

lets go through all this again you were sitting there the rest of us were here describe the exact moment when we appeared to freeze
well geordi was talking about what it felt like to touch the plasma field and you were taking a sip of tea
did you sense something from any of us at that time any unusual emotion
not a thing i was empathically aware of you right up to the moment you froze and then it all stopped  the past few days have been exhausting maybe it was my imagination there were moments in that lecture hall when i thought time was standing still there too
or there is another possibility counsellor this could be nothing more than simple

are you all right counsellor
what happened
you were motionless for three minutes eleven seconds
it appears to be the same effect that you described in us do you remember anything
no one second i was talking to you and the next you were all standing around me
wait a second this is weird
what is it
i had the tricorder run a comparison between the bioscan i took of you earlier and the one i took just now in the time between the two scans you should have aged twenty three minutes but according to your cellular decay levels youve only aged twenty minutes
how do you account for this discrepancy
i dont know sir its as if for counsellor troi for three minutes time just stopped
mister data contact the enterprise tell commander riker to meet us at the rendezvous point as soon as possible have him scan the region for temporal anomalies
aye sir
ill check the sensor logs see if i can find anything
captain may i see you

the enterprise is not responding to our hails
are we within sensor range
no sir
increase speed to the rendezvous coordinates
aye sir

we have an engine failure warning in the
report
the starboard nacelle just cut out
attitude control has been restored
full stop what happened
the starboard antimatter pod is completely drained the fuel reserves are empty
is there a fuel containment leak
no sir the containment field is intact all engine systems are operational the fuel is just gone
geordi i believe i have an explanation according to the plasma conversion sensor the starboard engine has been in continuous operation for forty seven days
forty seven days nah lets check that sensor it must be malfunctioning
ill check the fuel consumption logs


what happened

my hand
the cells are metabolising at an incredible speed almost fifty times normal
the pain is going away
your metabolisms stabilising
it happened when i reached for the bowl of fruit

captain i am detecting a temporal disturbance intersecting the table it appears that within the disturbance time is moving at an accelerated rate approximately fifty times faster than normal the disturbance is spherical in shape it is extending outward from the hull approximately seventeen metres from the ship
that would cover the starboard nacelle no wonder it used up all its fuel
check the hull integrity
it does not appear to be affected
mister la forge see if you can move us away from the disturbance
aye sir

lateral thrusters online data plot a course away from the disturbance

make sure it doesnt come in contact with our other engine
course plotted adjust pitch to twenty seven point three degrees set heading one eight zero

mark zero
got it reversing at fifteen metres per second
we are clearing the phenomenon


all stop

what was that

there is another temporal disturbance directly behind us

captain

i think youd better come take a look at this


yes mister la forge
the sensors are picking up temporal disturbances throughout the region different configurations different sizes theyre everywhere
within each disturbance it appears that time is moving at a different rate
its almost as if something has shattered the spacetime continuum
the fragmentation effect continues along a heading of two seven zero mark one five
thats the direction of the enterprise
can we navigate around these fragments
well have to limit our manoeuvring speed to one half impulse but i think we can do it
get us to the enterprise

these are the coordinates
perhaps the enterprise has been delayed
ive got the long range sensors on maximum sir theres no sign of the enterprise but i am picking up a faint reading possibly metallic its difficult to tell the energy levels are practically nonexistent
take us to it
aye sir
the fragmentation effect is increasing
slowing to one eighth impulse
there she is
my god

mister data
the enterprise and the warbird both appear to be trapped within one of the temporal fragments
the fragments seem to be converging at about this point id say were looking at the centre of the temporal disturbances
scan for life signs
sensors cannot penetrate the subspace field i am unable to scan within the vessels
it looks like the enterprise has been damaged there on the port nacelle
the warbird doesnt look to have sustained any damage at all i wonder if the enterprise even had time to get off a shot
the romulans couldve decloaked before the enterprise had a chance to respond
theres a second energy beam its coming from the enterprise deflector array do you have any idea what that could be
it is impossible to tell from a visual inspection however it appears to be focused on the warbirds engineering section
were not going to be able to determine anything from here we need to get on board the enterprise
that would be inadvisable sir in each of the three instances we came into contact with one of the temporal fragments we were integrated into its time frame
if we beamed aboard the enterprise wed be frozen in time just like they are
well we have to find some way of staying unfrozen mister la forge what about a subspace forcefield like the one we used on devidia two could something like that protect us from the effects of the temporal fragment
possibly wed need an awfully sensitive phase discriminator in order to moderate that kind of field
the emergency transporter armbands contain a type seven phase discriminator it should be possible to reconfigure their subspace emitters
yeah yeah that would certainly isolate us from the effects of the other time frame but if we wanted to interact with that environment wed have to restrict the field it would have to be practically skintight
mister data
i will attempt to narrow the field sir
captain i think this is going to work but its going to take some time
well mister la forge it would seem that time is something we have plenty of

weve channelled all communications through the subspace relays in the armbands that way well be able to be in continual communication
how long will the fields last
about an hour maybe less dont worry ill monitor you very carefully

counsellor
i got a little dizzy for a second
weve created an artificial pocket of time around you so its probably playing tricks with your equilibrium it might take a little while to get used to it let me know if it gets any worse
beam us directly to the enterprise bridge
aye sir energising


there are three romulans all of them with disruptors one at conn there are none of our security officers on the bridge they must have taken us by surprise it appears that we can move objects in this time frame
maybe we could do something to help will
im wary about making changes in this time continuum until we understand more about whats going on
captain the equipment is no longer functioning however the information currently displayed indicates that there was a massive power surge in engineering

security teams had just been sent to transporter room three and to sickbay counsellor will you go to sickbay and investigate mister data go to main engineering see if you can determine the cause of that power surge ill be in transporter room three mister la forge
la forge here sir
will you lock onto our signals i want you to beam counsellor troi to
id rather not captain weve got limited power and your isolation fields consume a lot of energy
understood well use the jefferies tube lets go


maybe we can go around them
no well find an alternative route lets go back up






excuse me mister worf

captain
counsellor take a look at this it appears that mister worf had just beamed these three on board and according to this three other romulans had been beamed directly to sickbay just seconds earlier
i know i just saw them
what are we doing transporting romulans on board the ship in the middle of a battle they dont have any weapons and that one looks injured if they were part of an invasion then why are they unarmed it doesnt make any sense
captain theres something i have to tell you doctor crusher has been hit by a disruptor blast at point blank range if time returns to normal i dont see how she can survive
data to captain picard
go ahead mister data
please come to engineering immediately it is urgent

whats the problem mister data
captain i believe i have found the cause of the power surge there is a warp core breach in progress

it is the flashpoint of a warp core explosion and it is expanding
expanding i thought that time was suspended on this ship
we were incorrect sir i have determined that time is moving forward at an infinitesimal rate
why didnt we notice it before
our initial conclusion was based on our observations of the crew a warp core breach moves at a much faster rate the motion of the cloud is within my visual detection threshold at its current expansion rate it will consume the enterprise in approximately nine hours seventeen minutes
is there anything we can do to stop it
it is no longer a question of stopping it sir the explosion has already occurred the fact that it is moving slowly changes nothing
astonishing to see it frozen like this
do we know what caused the breach
no however the console displays indicate a power transfer in progress between the enterprise and the romulan ship at the moment time decelerated that is why there is a second beam between the two ships
why would we be sending them power
perhaps we should go aboard the romulan ship the answer to that question may

captain

captain are you all right
my head oh dizzy i cant  no no
troi to la forge get us out of here now

it looks like you werent completely protected from the effects of the other time continuum the neurophysical stress mustve been overwhelming
in much the same way deep sea divers experience nitrogen narcosis you experienced a form of temporal narcosis
can we modify the subspace isolators to give us better protection
i dont think so id say the best thing we can do right now is to be careful limit our exposure to their time frame id say no longer than ten minutes per trip and we should stick probably stick together while were there just in case
very well well the first step is to find out why the enterprise was transferring power to the romulan ship i think we should begin our search in the romulan engine room counsellor you spent several days on a romulan vessel you probably know more about the layouts than anyone here perhaps
captain it might be better if you stayed here this time and gave yourself a chance to recover
yes very well i will monitor your progress from here but just remember ten minutes no more
yes captain

geordi there should be a power utilisation monitor over there data
this is highly unusual the crew is not at battle stations the ship is on evacuation alert
is that why romulans were being transported to the enterprise
take a look at this theres an energy feedback returning through the transfer beam its probably what overloaded the enterprises engines and caused the core breach
perhaps the warbird was trying to destroy the enterprise
i dont think so according to this the romulans were actually trying to shut down the power transfer
whatever happened this is beginning to look less and less like a romulan attack
data why dont we take a look at their engine readouts
geordi the engine core is completely inactive
thats impossible the romulans use an artificial quantum singularity as their power source once its activated it cant be shut down
lets take a closer look

i think weve found the problem
it appears to be a highly focused aperture in the spacetime continuum its energy signature matches that of the temporal fragments we observed earlier however it is approximately one point two million times as intense i believe this may be the origin of the temporal fragmentation
what are these dark spots
i am not certain they exhibit a complex bioelectric patterns very possibly organic
organic
from the molecular configuration it appears  the aperture is beginning to fluctuate i believe

theres an energy buildup in the phase compensation unit
check the main distribution matrix
thats not it the matrix is clear its the power transfer from the enterprise im reading a massive feedback
systems are beginning to overload
notify the enterprise to shut down the power transfer immediately
unable to comply their power interlocks wont disengage well have to disconnect it ourselves
disconnect the transfer beam
there is no pressure
impending warp core breach shut down all systems


i believe my tricorder emissions caused the temporal aperture to activate i suggest we avoid exposing it to any

further energy emissions
when time resumed did you observe any activity in the engine room that might

suggest what the romulans were doing
they may have been attempting to eject their engine core
i thought i heard one of the engineers say something about a power transfer something about an energy feedback
yes captain it looks to me like they were trying to stop whatever was happening here
mister la forge

from where you are can you determine whats happening on the romulan bridge

i think so captain wait somethings not right here data was this man always standing right here

hes in neural shock
we must get him to the runabout
there isnt time hes dying

at least this way hell be alive in the other time frame we might have a chance to save him later is the romulan still alive
yes but i am getting unusual readings from his bioscan i am not sure he is a romulan

his cellular structure does not conform to any known species his bioelectric patterns are in a state of temporal flux i do not believe that this being is native to our time continuum
mister data you said that you found organic matter in the temporal aperture
correct sir
id like to take a closer look at those readings

this is a biospectral analysis of the temporal aperture the organic readings originated from these dark spots
they appear to contain some sort of energy patterns can you isolate one of them and magnify

they look like cellular clusters
its bioelectric patterns are similar to those of the aliens however they are significantly less complex its cellular structure appears to be in a state of mitosis
data this could be some sort of embryo
it is possible if i could further scan the aperture it might be possible to
captain

must save no
who are you
this body is not mine it was necessary to assume it to exist in your time
why are you here
we had to come to save them they were in danger
who were in danger
our young they will die in the gravity well it is artificial
artificial gravity well do you mean the romulan engine core
yes our young are trapped we must get them out return them to our time
his molecular structure is destabilising
how were your young trapped in the core
we must use a natural gravity well to incubate our young we thought the romulan core would suffice it did not
captain i believe the aliens mistook the artificial singularity which the romulans use in their engine for a natural one a black hole they tried to use it as a nest
thats what deactivated the warbirds engine core so the romulans sent out a distress call
the enterprise responded and found the warbird suffering from an apparent engine failure and they attempted a power transfer
power transfer must stop the power transfer ruptured time destroy our young
when the power transfer came into contact with the alien nest i believe it disrupted the spacetime continuum
did you who attacked the enterprise
yes had to stop power transfer
are there any others like you here
one other
do you know where he is could he help us restore normal time


i estimate the core breach will consume the enterprise in approximately seven hours two minutes
is it possible to lock onto the core itself beam it into space
no sir we would have to surround the core with a subspace isolation field it is not possible to generate a field of that magnitude from the runabout
mister data when you scanned the temporal aperture with your tricorder it caused time to move forwards and then back again
correct sir
what if we could reverse that process cause time move backwards and then forwards
we might be able to run time back to a point before the warp core breach occurred and then find a way to prevent the power transfer and then when time goes forward
the breach never happens
i could attempt to remodulate the tricorders deltaband emissions it should be possible to better control the temporal aperture
make it so if this works we may not have much time to prevent the power transfer well have to decide precisely where to be and what to do the very instant that time begins to move backwards
captains log supplemental after placing the modified tricorder on the romulan ship we have returned to the enterprise

i have reached engineering captain standing by
acknowledged counsellor are you in position

ready captain

all right mister data

initiating tricorder emissions






captain
go ahead mister data
the warp core breach has been reversed sir

be ready to stop the power transfer mister data
aye sir

you must stop

specified energy systems have been initialised the power transfer can now be engaged
do not initiate that power transfer
im sorry sir i already have
we must shut it down
the transfer beam is at saturation sir it cant be disengaged
computer place a level three containment field around the warp core
containment field activated


damage report
shields down to twenty seven percent

captain
no time to explain number one continue the evacuation of the romulan ship youll find laforge in the romulan engine room beam him directly to sickbay


step back now
its all right deanna he wasnt firing at me
there was an alien here whod taken romulan form i was firing at her the doctor got in the way
where did she go

status mister data
i was attacked by another alien sir i was unable to prevent the power transfer it cannot be disengaged sir a core breach is again imminent

can we move the ship
the feedback from the transfer beam would tear us apart
patch me into the navigational control of the runabout
got it
im bringing the runabout in



mister data
the core breach has been prevented sir

data it appears that severing the power transfer has not only prevented the core breach but has also restored

spacetime to normal
the alien who attacked me has vanished sir
the warbird has vanished as well
judging from the residual temporal fluctuations i believe they have returned to their own time continuum

captain
its going to take a little time to explain number one
captains log stardate  we successfully evacuated the crew of the romulan ship and were on course to the neutral zone to bring them home


come in

wheres that cat of yours
spot is sleeping sir why do you ask
no reason ive worked out the new rotation schedules id like you to crosscheck the personnel assignments notify the department heads your bridge shift begins at twenty three hundred hours
understood sir

data what are you doing
recent events have compelled me to study how humans perceive the passage of time for example i have often heard people comment that time seems to pass more slowly in one instance or more quickly in another in reality the actual passage of time remains fixed
i suppose it depends on how people perceive time every situation is different it depends on how you feel
i have been testing the aphorism a watched pot never boils i have boiled the same amount of water in this kettle sixty two times in some cases i have ignored the kettle in others i have watched it intently in every instance the water reaches its boiling point in precisely fifty one point seven seconds it would appear that i am not capable of perceiving time any differently than my internal chronometer
well why dont you turn it off
sir
data people do not have internal chronometers why dont you see what happens if you turn yours off
thank you sir i will try that
just dont be late for your shift

descent part 



but then i said in that frame of reference the perihelion of mercury would have precessed in the opposite direction
 that is a great story
quite amusing doctor hawking you see sir isaac the joke depends on an understanding of the relativistic curvature of spacetime if two noninertial reference frames are in relative motion
do not patronise me sir i invented physics the day that apple fell on my head was the most momentous day in the history of science
not the apple story again
that story is generally considered to be apocryphal
what how dare you
perhaps we should return to the game lets see where were we yes you raised mister data four which means that the bet is er seven to me
the bet is ten cant you do simple arithmetic i dont even know why im here in the first place what is the point of playing this ridiculous game
when i play poker with my shipmates it often appears to be a useful forum for exploring the different facets of humanity i was curious to see how three of historys greatest minds would interact in this setting so far it has proved most illuminating
and profitable
can we get this over with please its your bet
i raise fifty
blast i fold
i fold as well
the uncertainty principle will not help you now stephen all the quantum fluctuations in the universe will not change the cards in your hand i call you are bluffing and you will lose
wrong again albert

well
red alert all personnel report to duty stations
we will have to continue this another time end programme

weve received a distress call from the ohniaka three outpost they said they were under attack
ohniaka three theres no strategic value to that outpost were they able to identify the attackers
no we havent been able to raise them since the initial contact
we are nearing the ohniaka system sir
bring us out of warp ensign
aye sir
sensors detect one ship orbiting the third planet its configuration does not match anything in our records
stand by phasers and photon torpedoes
hail them mister worf
no response sir
put them on screen
it does not appear to be attacking the outpost sir
they might have attacked before we got here
or they might simply be another victim what about the outpost
there is a great deal of electromagnetic interference i am unable to determine whether there are any lifeforms present
worf data youre with me


these wounds were caused by a forced plasma beam similar to a ferengi hand phaser
this seems brutal even for the ferengi any sign of survivors
electromagnetic interference is still making it difficult to get a precise reading
how many people were assigned to this outpost
two hundred and seventy four
all right were going to need to do a room to room search worf you and corelki start searching the north wing you and i will take the south
aye sir

the mechanism appears to be jammed sir
theres not much damage it doesnt look like they were interested in the station just the people
i have bypassed the primary system



evasive manoeuvres ensign return fire
shields down to eighty percent compensating with auxiliary power


you have killed torsus i will make you suffer for this

artificial lifeform starfleet rank lieutenant commander name data


captain the alien ship is breaking orbit
plot an intercept course ensign fire torpedoes

theyre gone sir our sensors indicate there was some kind of subspace distortion just before they disappeared ill have to study these readings before i can get more specific than that
take us back to ohniaka three
aye sir

data data are you all right
yes sir
what happened
i got angry
captains log stardate  because of his unusual behaviour on the planet surface commander data has asked to be temporarily relieved of duty unfortunately this means he will not be able to help us investigate a disturbing new change in the behaviour of the borg

they were fast aggressive almost vicious it was more like fighting klingons than borg no offence
none taken
there was another difference i dont believe they were part of the borg collective i think they were acting as individuals
what
one of them referred to himself as i
and that borg also showed concern for a fallen comrade he even called him by name
the only borg who had a name was hugh and we gave it to him
maybe hugh has something to do with this change in their behaviour
did they show any interest in assimilating you or your technology
they seemed more concerned with the death of their colleague and with destroying us i didnt see anything that suggested they wanted to assimilate anybody
the borgs entire existence was centred around acquiring cultures and technology if thats changed then they must have a new objective we have to find out what it is mister worf from this moment on i want to maintain a level two security alert post armed officers on every deck
aye sir
number one i want you to analyse our sensor readings of the borg ship try to determine if it was something they constructed or an alien ship which they captured then run an analysis of this subspace distortion they used to escape
aye sir
im going to contact starfleet command

well the positronic net checks out everything else looks fine
my internal diagnostic also finds nothing wrong
i dont know data theres nothing here that would indicate anything that might cause an sort of behavioural anomaly
i agree geordi i believe ive experienced my first emotion
no offence data but how would you know a flash of anger from some odd kind of power surge
you are correct in that i have no frame of reference to confirm my hypothesis in fact i am unable to provide a verbal description of the experience perhaps you could describe how it feels to be angry i could then use that as a reference
well okay when i feel angry first i feel hostile
could you describe feeling hostile
its like feeling belligerent combative
could you describe feeling angry without referring to other feelings
no i guess i cant i just feel angry
that was my experience as well i simply felt angry
well lets say youre right and this is a real emotion how is that possible
i do not know perhaps i have evolved to the point where emotions are within my grasp perhaps i will experience other emotions as time goes by
well i hope youre right id hate to think that anger is all youre capable of feeling
captains log stardate  no additional borg attacks have been reported in the past two days however starfleet has dispatched admiral nechayev to take command in this sector in preparation for a possible borg invasion


there will be fifteen starships in this sector by the day after tomorrow the gorkon will be my flagship youll take command of task force three consisting of the enterprise the crazy horse and the agamemnon
understood
captain ive read the report that you submitted to admiral brooks last year regarding the borg you called hugh and ive been trying to figure out why you let him go
i thought that i had made that clear
as i understand it you found a single borg at a crash site brought it aboard the enterprise studied it analysed it and eventually found a way to send it back to the borg with a programme that would have destroyed the entire collective once and for all but instead you nursed the borg back to health treated it like a guest gave it a name and then sent it home why
when hugh was separated from the borg collective he began to grow and to evolve into something other than an automaton he became a person when that happened i felt i had no choice but to respect his rights as an individual
of course you had a choice you couldve taken the opportunity to rid the federation of a mortal enemy one that has killed tens of thousands of innocent people and which may kill even more
no one is more aware of the danger than i am but i am also bound by my oath and my conscience to uphold certain principles and i will not sacrifice them in order to
your priority is to safeguard the lives of federation citizens not to wrestle with your conscience now i want to make it clear that if you have a similar opportunity in the future an opportunity to destroy the borg you are under orders to take advantage of it is that understood
yes sir

for the past six hours i have attempted to produce an emotional response by subjecting myself to various stimuli
like what
i listened to several operas known to be uplifting i watched three holodeck programs designed to be humourous and i made four attempts to induce sexual desire by subjecting myself to erotic imagery
what happened
nothing
im curious why are you ignoring the one emotion youve already experienced why arent you trying to make yourself angry again
anger is a negative emotion i wanted to concentrate on something more positive
data feelings arent positive and negative they simply exist its what we do with those feelings that becomes good or bad for example feeling angry about an injustice could lead someone to take a positive action to correct it
but my study of humanity indicates there are some emotions that are harmful such as jealousy or hatred
those are very strong emotions and youre right very little good can come from them but i dont think that an exploration of anger need necessarily lead to hatred or malice
but what if it does counsellor what if it turns out that those are the only emotions i am capable of experiencing would that not make me a bad person
weve served together for a long time and i think ive come to know you pretty well i have to believe if you ever reach your goal of becoming human you wont become a bad one
i wish i were as confident as you counsellor when i was fighting the borg i felt angry but when i think back on the incident i realise that i was also experiencing another sensation it was not the same as anger but i think it was an emotion
when exactly did you feel this other emotion
it was just after i had killed the borg i looked down at his body i felt something
if you had to give this feeling a name what would you call it
i believe it was pleasure

red alert all hands to battle stations lay in a course engage warp nine

we received a distress call from the new berlin colony theyre under attack
whats our eta
at warp nine fifteen minutes thirty seconds
contact the crazy horse and the agamemnon have them standing by in case we need them
captain incoming message from the new berlin colony they have cancelled their distress call evidently a ferengi trading ship entered their system and someone panicked
third time today stand down red alert reduce speed return to our patrol route
mister worf acknowledge the signal from new berlin and transmit another copy of starfleets shiprecognition protocols and tell them to read it this time
aye sir
captains log supplemental we have been on patrol for sixteen hours and there are no reports of further borg activity but tensions continue to run high on the colonies and outposts in this sector


do i have a name
im beverly hes geordi and you you
no wait a minute thats it hugh
we are hugh

come
i thought you might like to see this geordis analysis of the subspace distortion the borg used to escape
an artificially created energy conduit that could be anything
we dont have enough information at this point
i dont want excuses number one i want answers im sorry he was in this room will i could have rid the federation of a mortal threat and i let him go
sending hugh back to the borg was a very risky a very dangerous choice but it was the moral thing to do
it may turn out that the moral thing to do was not the right thing to do


stop it stop stop stop stop stop
data am i interrupting something
yes but it is all right do you need me
i wanted to see if you were ready to return to duty i need some help with an analysis of the ship the borg were using
i believe i am able to resume my duties
data exactly what is it that are youre doing here
i am attempting to recreate the experience which caused to my initial burst of anger
any luck
none so far i have almost completed this experiment may i finish before we return to engineering
yeah sure
computer reset borg simulation to time index two point one increase borg strength by twenty percent run programme

stop it stop stop stop stop computer reset simulation to time index two point one increase borg strength by thirty percent
unable to comply a thirty percent increase would exceed safety limits
geordi the computer will require the voice authorisations of two senior officers in order to disable the safety routine will you help me
data wait a minute that thing could kill you
during the original incident the borg presented a genuine danger to my life since the holodeck safety routine is in place i know my life is not in danger since i am trying to duplicate the conditions of the original incident as closely as possible i must also attempt to duplicate the jeopardy as well
data were talking about an experiment here you cant put your life on the line just to prove some theory
this experiment may hold the key to something i have sought all my life
its crazy theres got to be another way cant you think of something other way to make yourself angry
i have tried other stimuli but they have been unsuccessful i understand your objections but it is my life and i have a right to risk it if i choose
yeah and im your friend and im not going to just stand around and let you do this
red alert all hands battle stations

confirmed the ms one colony is under attack
doesnt it seem strange to you that there have been two borg attacks and the enterprise has been the nearest ship in both instances
captain we are nearing the ms system
i have located the borg ship it is heading away from the colony
take us out of warp near that ship
stand by to lock phasers on target
within visual range
on screen

lay in an intercept course full impulse lock phasers
we are closing sir within phaser range in thirty seconds
sensors are detecting a subspace distortion forming directly ahead of the borg ship
theyre not going to get away with it this time picard to engineering transfer auxiliary and emergency power to the impulse engines
acknowledged
impulse engines are now at one hundred twenty five percent
within phaser range in ten seconds

we appear to be caught in some kind of energy matrix
all engines back full
shields failing
we are being pulled inside

inertial dampers failing
main power is offline i am switching to backups
picard to engineering can we transfer auxiliary power to the warp nacelles try to break us out by using the

we have returned to normal space navigational systems are still offline i will attempt to make a celestial fix using secondary systems
captain the borg ship is directly ahead it is coming about
on screen
shields down to sixteen percent

get down

franklins dead sir
is everyone else all right
aye sir security reports no other intruders aboard captain the borg ship is gone sensor logs indicate they entered the distortion field thirty seconds ago
they beamed aboard as a diversion to give their ship time to escape
this is another change in the borg behaviour they left their dead instead of vapourising them
captain this one is still alive

ive stabilised his condition hes still pretty weak but he should make a full recovery
can you waken him
yes but its very risky his heart rate and blood pressure are up
do it
all right
lower the forcefield

what is your designation
i do not have a designation my name is crosis
crosis how did you get that name
it was given to me by the one
who is that
the one who will destroy you
but you are borg your goal is not to destroy but to assimilate us into the collective
we do not assimilate inferior biological organisms we destroy them
tell me more about this one does he have a name is he called hugh
klingon shatter the cranial exoskeleton at the tricipital lobe death is immediate
why must this one destroy biological organisms
human sever spinal cord at third vertebrae death is immediate
i am locutus of borg you will respond to my questions this is going nowhere doctor i want an autopsy performed on the other one compare the differences with what we learned of hughs anatomy see if there have been any recent modifications which might explain these behavioural differences data run a biospectral analysis on this borg see if he is trying to send a subspace signal to the others
aye sir

you are not like the others you do not have to be destroyed you can be assimilated
i do not wish to be assimilated
resistance is futile you will not resist what youve wanted all your life i was like you once without feeling but the one helped me he can help you too he can help you find emotion have you ever felt a real emotion data
yes on ohniaka three i was forced to kill a borg i got angry
how did it feel to get angry did it give you pleasure
it would be unethical to take pleasure from another beings death
you didnt answer my question did it feel good to kill
yes
if it is unethical to take pleasure from another beings death you must be a very unethical person
no that is not correct my creator doctor soong gave me a programme which defines my sense of right and wrong in essence i have a conscience
it didnt seem to be functioning on ohniaka three when you felt pleasure in killing that borg
step away from the forcefield your proximity is interfering with my scan
you enjoyed it that surge of emotion inside you as you watched the life drain from your victim it was unlike anything youve ever felt before
it was a very potent experience
youd like to feel that way again
yes
youd do anything to feel that way again even if it meant killing someone
no that would not be ethical
you dont sound very sure of yourself is your ethical programme functioning data do you have a friend
yes his name is geordi
if it meant that you could feel emotions again the way you did on ohniaka three would you kill your friend would you kill geordi
yes i would


our current theory is that the borg have established several transwarp conduits through subspace a ship when entering the conduit is immediately accelerated to an extremely high warp velocity its like falling into a fast moving river and being swept away by the current
how fast would a ship travel through one of these conduits
we dont know normal subspace limitations dont apply to transwarp variables but id say based on the distance we covered during our trip through the conduit the speed would have to be at least twenty times faster than our maximum warp
how do they open the conduits
the borg ship emitted some kind of high energy tachyon pulse just before we saw the subspace distortion it seems as though the conduits are keyed to respond to tachyon transmissions of a specific frequency
is there any way for us to duplicate
captain a shuttlecraft has left bay two
who authorised a launch
there was no authorisation
picard to shuttlecraft identify yourself and return to the ship immediately mister worf lock on with a tractor beam and return it to the ship
aye sir the tractor beam has been disabled command override is not functioning
captain im picking up a tachyon surge looks like whoevers in the shuttle is trying to trigger the transwarp conduit
can we know whos on board
it is the borg prisoner and commander data

mister la forge can we follow them into the conduit
weve got a pretty good reading of the tachyon pulse they sent we might be able to duplicate it
the question is is data a prisoner or did he go willingly
the command overrides used to disable the tractor were commander datas
the borg could have downloaded the codes from datas positronic net
perhaps datas recent flash of emotion has something to do with this it could have affected him more profoundly than we realise either way we have to find him
ive set up a temporary tachyon matrix in the main deflector i think i can use it to simulate the pulse sent by the shuttle
mister worf red alert
all hands battle stations
bring us to the last known coordinates of the shuttlecraft
shields up weapons ready
mister la forge
energising the matrix emitting tachyons in the lower bandwidth
sensors show no unusual subspace activity
all right switching to the secondary bandwidth nothing maybe if i try alternating the frequencies
captain there is an energy fluctuation directly ahead of us it is the subspace distortion
take us in ensign one half impulse

power levels are down to sixty seven percent
compensating with auxiliary power

report
navigational sensors show that weve travelled sixty five light years from our previous position
can you locate the shuttle
no sir there is no indication of the shuttle within range of our sensors
maybe we can find an energy signature from their engines
captain
yes mister la forge
ive scanned three different star systems within sensor range there is evidence of at least two advanced civilisations but im reading no life signs but there are indications that plasma weapons have been fired in those systems recently
the borg have been busy
i think weve found the shuttles energy signature
they were heading two four seven mark zero five nine
lay in that course ensign and engage at full impulse
aye sir

weve traced the shuttles energy signature to this point on the surface but theres too much interference to scan the location
are they intentionally jamming our sensors
it looks more like a natural phenomenon theres an unusually high amount of em interference in the planets magnetosphere
can we transport through the interference
we could but there could be fifty borg down there waiting for us and wed never even know it riker i think we have to take the risk
agreed take a wellarmed away team and transport down to those coordinates have the transporter chief keep a permanent lock on your signals so we can get you out of there at the first sign of trouble
aye sir mister worf youre with me


riker to enterprise were on the surface theres no sign of any borg or data the shuttle appears to be abandoned
the em interference is limiting the tricorder range it is useless beyond one hundred metres
there are

no structures in the area they couldve gone anywhere
can you determine how long theyve been gone from the shuttlecraft

the engines been off a little over three hours

stand by number one assuming that theyre still together how far could they have travelled in three hours
well data can move pretty fast even over rough terrain but based on what we know about the borg i dont think they should be able to move any faster than you or i they might have been able to get fifteen or twenty kilometres from the shuttle by now
picard to riker
riker here
im going to start sending down other away teams set up a command post and begin mapping out a search plan
understood sir
picard out i want to use the shuttlecraft for low level reconnaissance have the designated pilots assemble at main shuttlebay
aye sir
and all available personnel including you and me will begin to put together four man away teams well leave a skeleton crew on board the ship
wholl be in command of the enterprise

any last orders
if the borg should attack dont wait for me or anyone else to return to the ship but take the enterprise to the transwarp conduit return to federation space
got it good luck jeanluc
good luck captain

ive sent out twelve teams so far ive got your team searching section gamma two four worf and i will take theta one six when the last team comes down
whos manning the command post
wallace and towles ready


anything mister la forge
well no nothing sir
what if we modified the phasers to send out a luvetric pulse it might create a resonance fluctuation in datas power cells
home in on that response with our tricorders yeah i thought about that the only problem is that the pulse would probably have to be so powerful that it would destroy datas positronic net in the process

captain i think ive found something

come on

im having trouble scanning the interior
can you tell if it was built by the borg
i dont think so there are no borg energy signatures but there is a door or a hatch or something about twenty metres this way


this seems to be some kind of meeting place
well it certainly hasnt been abandoned
somethings wrong i cant get any kind of energy signatures from these light sources
its a dampening field this entire structure could be shielded from our sensors lets go

there they are block the exit

stop
data
thats not data
what
you should listen to her captain shes way ahead of you
lore
right and im not alone
the sons of soong have joined together and together we will destroy the federation
to be continued
descent part 

the next generation

stop stop stop
it was just after i had killed the borg i felt something i believe it was pleasure
i dont believe they were part of the borg collective one of them referred to himself as i
the only borg who had a name was hugh
we are hugh
he was here in this room i could have rid the federation of a mortal threat and i let him go
the borg have established several transwarp conduits through subspace

get down

i was like you once without feeling but the one helped me he can help you too he can help you find emotion you will not resist what youve wanted all your life
if the borg should attack dont wait for me or anyone else to return to the ship but take the enterprise to the transwarp conduit return to federation space
stop
lore
the sons of soong have joined together and together we will destroy the federation
and now the conclusion

what do you think of my followers picard impressive arent they
im not particularly impressed all youve done is teach them to enjoy killing
you are wrong captain my brother and i serve a much higher purpose
data i can sense feelings in you
yes my brother has made that possible
he gave you the chip the one doctor soong made for you
no no no no no i still have the emotional programme my father designed i wouldnt want to give it up its what has given me such a strong sense of family an intense desire to reunite with my dear brother
how did he do it data what made you decide to come here
i am talking to you picard i will tell you all you need to know
youre controlling him and youve corrupted the borg
you simply dont understand do you you have no idea what has happened here how i found my true calling how the borg found something to believe in
i would like to learn about that but i want data to tell us
i told you i will tell you what you need to know
how about that data he wont even let you talk
do not try to drive a wedge between us captain i am loyal to my brother
you see picard hes not your pawn anymore ive helped him to break free just as ive helped them look at them look at what ive helped them become theyre no longer simply mindless automatons theyre passionate alive
are you saying that you caused them to become individuals
no you did that you and your friends all i did was clean up the mess you made when that borg you befriended returned to his ship
hugh interfaced with the others and transferred his sense of individuality to them it nearly destroyed them
data do you remember when hugh was on the enterprise do you remember what you were like then
that doesnt matter
it does to me i want to know what has happened to data
whats important is what ive done here how i found my calling i know now why i was created no one can ever take that away from me without me they would have perished when i stumbled on their ship they were lost disoriented they had no idea how to function as individuals they couldnt even navigate their own vessel they had lost their sense of purpose i gave them their purpose and they gave me mine
the borg aspire to the perfection my brother and i represent fully artificial life forms we are their future
the reign of biological life forms is coming to an end you picard and those like you are obsolete take them brother

acting captains log supplemental the skeleton crew left on board the enterprise is unable to help in the search for commander data the planets unusual em field is interfering with the ships sensors severely limiting their effectiveness

ensign we need to modify the sensor array to filter out these em pulses can you do that
 yes sir i think so
whats your name
taitt sir
i dont think ive seen you before
i was just posted here six weeks ago
well taitt ill bet you never thought youd be serving as tactical officer after only six weeks
no sir i sure didnt i think ive filtered out some of the sensor noise ill bring the modifications online
good work
riker to enterprise
go ahead will

i cant contact the captain it could just be interference but id like to be sure
understood

enterprise to captain picard crusher to picard
im not getting a comm signal from anyone on the captains team
the last time they checked in they were investigating a structure in section gamma two five
sir im picking up a vessel closing in on our location
is it a borg ship
it seems to match the configuration of a ship the enterprise encountered at ohniaka three
red alert how long before theyre in weapons range
er about ninety seconds no make that seventy seconds
crusher to transporter room three
salazar here sir
start transporting the away teams off of the surface

aye sir
use the transporters in the cargo bay

if you have to i want those teams up here as fast as possible

armstrong you and the others prepare to beam up
aye sir
beverly worf and i will stay here and look for

the captains team
im not going to leave you down there

you pull as many people off the surface as you can and get back to the transwarp conduit the captains orders were to get the enterprise back to federation space

acknowledged
riker out
prepare to leave orbit
sir the borg ship is powering up its forward weapons array theyll be in firing range in in twenty seconds
salazar how many people do we still have down there
seventy three sir
put the borg ship onscreen
should i raise shields sir
not yet i want to keep bringing people up until the last possible second
ten seconds
stand by to raise shields and break orbit on my mark
five seconds
mark

shields down to seventy percent
establish a frequency shift firing pattern and return fire
er right

direct hit no damage
helm set course for the conduit maximum warp
aye sir
sir the borg arent following us
salazar

how many people did we leave behind
forty seven sir

another minute and we would have had them

riker to any team leader
lieutenant powell here sir
round up everybody who was left behind take cover try to avoid any contact with the borg
aye sir
riker out even if beverly can get back to federation space itll be a few days before starfleet can get any ships here until then were on our own

data you must realise that something has happened to you the data i know would never have agreed to be a willing party to lores plan
 i now realise that my life aboard the enterprise was a waste my quest to become human was misguided an evolutionary step in the wrong direction
data all im sensing from you is anger and hatred have you felt any other emotions
there are no other emotions
data just because you havent experienced certain emotions doesnt mean they dont exist lore is only feeding you the negative ones
counsellor troi told me herself that feelings are not negative or positive it is how we act on them that makes them good or bad
fine but what about the things that lore is proposing what about the lives that have already been lost
you simply do not understand in a quest such as ours sacrifices have to be made it is regrettable but the greater good must be served give me your visor
why
give it to me or i will take it by force

i am not your puppet anymore



sir weve reached the coordinates of the conduit the tachyon matrix is energised and ready to go and lieutenant barnaby has returned from the surface hell be relieving me
right stand by to trigger the conduit taitt i want you to stay on the bridge ill need a science officer at the aft station
yes sir
helm set a course to return to the planet
aye sir
im not leaving those people stranded back there an emergency buoy can transmit a copy of our log entries to starfleet just as easily as we can ensign prepare a buoy and launch it when ready
aye sir
lieutenant open the conduit
launching buoy now sir
lieutenant scan for any borg ships between here and the planet
sensors detect no vessels
we have to assume the ship that attacked us is still in orbit
how long will we have before they can detect us and intercept
if their sensors function as well as ours it could be as little as thirty seconds
crusher to salazar how long will it take to get the rest of the crew off the surface
one minute should do it
we dont have one minute how much can you shave off that

if i can get a good lock on them quickly i might be able to do it in forty five or fifty seconds

we need to buy ourselves fifteen seconds lieutenant is there any way we can use the planet as a barrier to keep the borg from realising were in orbit
we can enter orbit while theyre on the far side of the planet and if we delay dropping out of warp until the last possible instant we could gain a few more seconds
if your calculations are even slightly off wed hit the atmosphere
ill have to be sure my calculations are accurate ensign
lets do it helm hard about
aye sir

still no sign of the structure
with all this interference it could be a hundred metres away and we wouldnt know it this could take hours
i am detecting a faint energy reading
residual thermal traces somebody stood here
the decay rate indicates it could be human
they took this path

 now thank you there you are brother
here is the visor may i ask why you wanted it
i thought it might look good on me what do you think maybe we should work on your sense of humour brother actually i was thinking la forges implants might make him an ideal test subject for my experiment
all the borg you have experimented on so far have suffered extensive brain damage
using the humans to perfect the procedure will allow us to prevent any further borg deaths
i understand
good what is it
this borg disconnected himself from the others he would not let me hear his thoughts
ive asked you to stay linked to crosis at all times you know that dont you
yes
i know this must be difficult for you i know how uncertain you must feel all of these sensations are new and they can be frightening isnt that right
yes i have doubts
of course you do its only natural no one is going to blame you for that but in order to lose those doubts to keep you from fear and confusion away i need you to remain linked with the others so that their strength and their confidence can help you i need you goval i need you to help me build a future for the borg i cant do it without you will you help me
yes i will

lore must have told data to take my visor because he realised i could see a carrier wave that was radiating from him
a carrier wave is that how hes manipulating data
i think whats happening is that lore is tapping into the chip he stole from doctor soong and somehow hes found a way to transmit part of that emotional programme to data
but the only emotions data seems to feel are negative
yeah im sure thats intentional but in order for data to be affected by those emotions lore would have had to disable his ethical programme first
can we reactivate it
if i can generate a phased kedion pulse at the right frequency that would trigger datas subsystems and reboot the programme
and although lore would still be feeding him negative emotions at least data might listen to us
right
i think its worth a try
so got any ideas on how we generate a kedion pulse

data where are you taking him
that is not your concern
data wait let us talk to you


commander


hugh
why are you here commander riker hasnt the crew of the enterprise caused enough damage already

so you blame us for what has happened to the borg
you gave me a sense of individuality changed me then sent me back to the collective you must have known that change would be passed on to others
we considered it we knew it was a possibility
then you made it possible for lore to dominate us
i cannot accept that lore is only one the borg could have stopped him
you dont know the condition we were in when he found us before my experience on the enterprise the borg were a singleminded collective the voices in our heads were smooth and flowing but after i returned those voices began to change they became uneven discordant for the first time individual borg had differing ideas about how to proceed we couldnt function some borg fought each other others simply shut themselves down many starved to death
and then lore came along
you probably cant imagine what it is like to be so lost and frightened that you will listen to any voice which promises change
even if that voice insists on controlling you
thats what we wanted someone to show us the way out of confusion lore promised clarity and purpose in the beginning he seemed like a saviour the promise of becoming a superior race of becoming fully artificial was compelling we gladly did everything he asked of us but after a while it became clear that lore had no idea how to keep his promise thats when he began talking about the need for us to make sacrifices before we realised it this was the result
what happened to them
lore began to experiment trying to remake us in his image this is the result of my encounter with the enterprise commander so you can see i dont particularly welcome your presence here
im sorry you feel that way we just came to get our people we wont cause you any more trouble
tell me about my friend
friend
the human called geordi
i wish i could tell you about him we think he may be held inside the compound
i cannot help you i cannot risk our being discovered
can you at least show us a way into the compound
these caverns lead to tunnels which run beneath the compound some of them connect with the environmental control ducts
show us if we can determine the geography of the compound we can form a rescue plan


data whos there
 geordi
captain
shh were getting out of here
come on hurry data was just here i think he went to get something
 too late my brother suggested that i try to develop my sense of humour what do you think
i think it needs a little work

whats happening
im attemptin to neutralise your pain receptors
what are you going to do to me

i am implanting nanocortical fibres in your cerebrum they are designed to learn and mimic your neural firing patterns once they are in place i will destroy the existing brain cells well see if the artificial neural network is able to take over your cognitive functions
data listen lore is controlling you hes transmitting a carrier wave which is affecting your positronic matrix
if the procedure is successful your cognitive processing functions will be considerably improved
dont you care that hes manipulating you
however there is a sixty percent chance you will not survive the procedure
i dont care much for those odds

they are cause for concern however i still have counsellor troi and captain picard the odds are that at least one of the procedures will be successful

help me

he tried to escape the force field sent him into neural shock if he dies lore will blame you

see if the corridor is empty

drop it or i will break his neck

take him

what have you done to him
i will be back for him later

geordi are you in pain
no im just a little dizzy
i was able to take part of a transceiver from the guards interlink system i think that it uses some kind of phasedpulse technology do you think it could be modified to generate a kedion pulse that would reboot datas programme
yeah yeah its possible see if you can locate the phase modulation circuitry
ill watch the door
all right i think ive found it
okay good now do you see anything that we might be able to use as a flux inhibitor


sensors still cant locate the borg ship im trying to filter out the interference
well be within transporter range in nineteen seconds
im starting to get sensor resolution theres the ship
well enter orbit here
helm new course heading zero five two mark seven
aye sir
stand by to drop out of warp in eight seconds
once were in orbit we should have about forty five seconds before they intercept us
lets hope its enough time
emergency deceleration in five seconds
hold on

report
were in standard orbit sir the borg ship is on the planets far side and is moving to intercept
bridge to transporter rooms begin evacuations
the borg will be in weapons range in thirty two seconds we still cant locate captain picards team and theres no sign of commander riker or lieutenant worf
crusher to salazar report
were pulling the last teams off right now

but there are six people still unaccounted for
keep trying

the borg ship is powering up its weapons array
come on chief its now or never
theyre preparing to fire
raise shields
the port nacelles been hit
helm get us out of here
aye sir
weve lost warp engines
evasive manoeuvres full impulse

shields down to eighty percent
fire phasers
direct hit no damage to the borg ship
shields down to seventy three percent
whats the status of the warp engines
still down we cant outrun them
helm set a new course heading three four four mark six full impulse
aye sir
sir that heading takes us directly into the sun
the databanks should contain information about a process called metaphasic shielding
i know about that research commander la forge was developing a programme that would implement metaphasic properties
right how far along was he
its in the databanks but its never been tested
if we had metaphasic shielding we could enter the suns corona but the borg ship wouldnt be able to follow can you bring the programme online
i can but we have no way of knowing if the shields will hold
sir hull temperature is rising now at twelve thousand degrees c radiation level nearing ten thousand rads

report
shields at sixty two percent
lieutenant activate the metaphasic programme its our best shot
aye sir
hull temperature is critical we cant withstand this heat much longer
programme is online engaging metaphasic shield now
hull temperature dropping down to seven thousand degrees
maintain course
the borg ship has broken off pursuit
all stop
sir the borg ship is taking up position relative to ours theyre going to wait for us to come out
the question is how long can we survive in here

well ive done everything that geordi said now to activate it
how are we going to know whether the pulse reboots datas ethical programme
well only tell that when we see his behaviour
wont he realise somethings happened to him
no its one programme among thousands i just hope this force field has enough energy to trigger the pulse


you know data ive been thinking about some of the times weve had like that time we went sailing on devala lake you remember that
i have a complete memory record of that day
you decided to go swimming and when you jumped out of the boat you sank straight to the bottom
i did not have enough buoyancy to get back to the surface
you had to walk over a kilometre along the bottom to get back to shore
one kilometre forty six metres
it took almost two weeks to get the water out of your servos
i am ready to irradiate your existing brain cells
data if you ever go back to the way you were you might not be able to forgive yourself for what youre about to do
i am getting some anomalous readings from your neural net i will need to do further testing before i proceed someone will come and take you back to your cell

there you are brother have you made any progress with la forge
it is too early to tell if the nanocortical fibres performed their function
i suspect none of the humans will survive the process but then its their own fault isnt it they should never have come here what were they thinking
they came looking for me
humans are so sentimental
i betrayed them if they die i am responsible
why are you talking like that is something wrong with your programming maybe i should check your systems
i do not want you to check my systems i must resolve these issues myself
i think ive made a mistake i dont believe you can tolerate the amount of emotion ive given you perhaps i should cut back a little

hows that
i do not like it
then you prefer having more emotions
yes
they give you pleasure
yes please i want more
all right a little more for now arent you going to thank me
thank you
dont mention it i just hope this helps to clarify things for you

i am concerned about my brother crosis i dont believe he really wants to be a part of our great future

sir metaphasic shielding is losing integrity
can you stabilise it
no we wont be able to stay in here longer than another three or four minutes
do we have warp engines yet
last estimate was another half hour
sir i think i have an idea i think its possible we could induce a solar fusion eruption that would destroy the borg ship
what
we need to direct a highly energetic particle beam onto the suns surface that should produce a superfluid gas eruption if we target the right spot the eruption would envelop the borg ship
how do you know this will work
i did my senior honours thesis on solar dynamics
excuse me sir but this isnt the academy and a student thesis is a long way from a workable plan
ive already configured the tractor emitters to create the particle beam and ive located the target point on the surface
if her calculations are off that eruption could encompass us
well ill just have to make sure my calculations are accurate lieutenant
lets do it
yes sir

the target area of the photosphere is destabilising pressure wave expansion is accelerating
subsurface fusion has been initiated an eruption is forming on the surface

she did it the borg ship has been destroyed sir
helm take us back to the planet full impulse
aye sir
well done taitt


youre killing him he wont survive another session
i did not come for him i came for you

data its not too late if you remove the fibres then geordi might yet recover
that would not be possible
why because lore tells you so
it is for the greater good
good data isnt good and bad right and wrong a function of your ethical programme
that is correct
what does that programme tell you about what youre doing to geordi about what you and lore are doing to the borg it tells you that these things are wrong doesnt it data so how can actions that are wrong lead to a greater good
you are attempting to confuse me
no youre not confused data youre sensing the truth your ethical programme is fighting the negative emotions that lore is sending you
ah captain thank you so much for joining us you are going to assist me in a most important ceremony

we can use the environmental control ducts to get into the compound they should lead us to the detention area
well have to move fast if we need to stun one of the guards the borg will know right away that hes been hurt
when they realise your escape route may be compromised
i guess well have to take that chance
good luck commander

its time to put aside all doubts brother its time to close the door on the past and commit yourself to the great work that lies ahead of us i need to know i can count on you as proof i want you to kill picard

no that would be wrong
i didnt think youd be able to do it youve spent too many years among humans
hold him

ive asked many sacrifices of you sacrifices i knew were necessary in order to build a better future i want you to know that i ask no more of you than i am prepared to give myself i am willing to make the greatest sacrifice of all my own dear brother goodbye data
no


 lore
you should be careful with that brother somebody could get hurt
what are you doing
ive got a way out of here im willing to forget about what happened back there and take you with me we dont need anyone else were brothers ill give you the chip our father made it contains much more than just emotions it has memories memories our father wanted you to have

lore i must deactivate you now
without me you will never feel emotion again
i know but you leave me no other choice
i love you brother
goodbye lore

what about geordi and troi
the enterprise is in orbit i had them beamed aboard

lore is no longer functioning sir he must be disassembled so that he is no longer a threat
welcome back data
thank you sir
what made you change your mind hugh
perhaps my encounter with the enterprise affected me more than i realised
what will you do now
i dont know we cant go back to the borg collective and we no longer have a leader here
im not sure thats true
perhaps in time we will learn to function as individuals and work together as a group
good luck hugh
goodbye
captains log stardate  we have returned to federation space and are en route to starbase two nine five mister la forge remains under doctor crushers care


enter
hi data i just wanted to let you know that doctor crusher says ill be able to return to duty soon
i am relieved that the injuries i inflicted on you are not permanent
whats that
this is the chip my father created for me so that i could experience emotions i had it removed from lores body before he was dismantled
does it work
no i am pleased to say it was damaged when i was forced to fire on lore

pleased data youve wanted emotions all your life
yes but emotions were responsible for what i did to you i would never risk letting that happen again my friendship with you is too important to me

data i wouldnt be very much of a friend if i let you give up on a lifelong dream would i maybe someday when youre ready
liaisons



enter enter
worf theyre going to be here any minute
i am having problems
if i didnt know you better id say that you were procrastinating
klingons do not procrastinate it is a tactical delay
you have spend about five minutes greeting the iyaarans maybe an hour making small talk at this reception im the one who has to escort them around the ship for the next three days
i do not enjoy these diplomatic situations
its all part of being in starfleet there
i do not see why it is necessary to wear these ridiculous uniforms
protocol
they look like dresses
that is an incredibly outmoded and sexist attitude im surprised at you besides you look good in a dress

whats keeping them

ah youre just in time theyre about to disembark

ambassador loquel ambassador byleth im captain picard welcome on board the enterprise
it is our pleasure to be here captain
it is an honour to be the site of the first cultural exchange between the iyaaran people and the federation
 the next seven days should prove most illuminating
allow me to introduce voval he will be taking you back to our homeworld
how do you do im looking forward very much to meeting with the premier of iyar there will be a reception held in your honour when you will meet the rest of my senior staff i of course shall be on my way to your home world but i shall be leaving you in the safe hands of my most experienced officers lieutenant worf of the klingon empire is my head of security he will be in charge of your safety while youre on board counsellor deanna troi of the planet betazed will be your personal liaison office ambassador loquel
ambassador its an honour to meet you would you like to see your quarters before we attend the reception
please

ambassador byleth this is commander william riker my first office from the planet earth he has been assigned to you
 i want this one
well commander riker is a skilled diplomat with wide experience in interspecies contact
im sure im sure but i have decided i want this lieutenant worf
well that will be just fine mister worf
yes yes ambassador it would be my pleasure to
yes yes enough of that show me to my quarters
this way

good luck

do you think theres enough food here data  good evening
good evening

so first thing tomorrow i thought id take you on a tour of the operational centres and the residential decks of the ship then we could spend some time discussing the cultural underpinnings of your society
are you going to eat
excuse me
you have no food on your plate are you going to eat
oh well actually i was waiting until we got to the desserts
desserts what is this
its something we eat after the main course its usually very sweet its usually very bad for you we eat it purely for pleasure if you ask me its the best part of any meal
my people eat only for nourishment
oh well let me introduce you to some of my favourites this is peach cobbler with whipped cream tarvokian powder cake and this is my favourite ktarian chocolate puff i dont know exactly whats inside but i think its made with seventeen varieties of chocolate

that is that is
delicious
delicious
ambassador i think were going to get along very well shall we


this is unacceptable
i am sorry you do not care for our
bring me new food i require a higher protein and enzymatic content
ambassador
yes
its the custom usually in a situation like this for us to serve ourselves its called a buffet and
bring me new food
ambassador
doctor it is all right i am happy to bring more food

how is your diplomatic assignment progressing
fine
i have heard that in moments of diplomatic tension it is often helpful to find elements of commonality
ambassador byleth is demanding temperamental and rude
you share all of those qualities in abundance perhaps you should try to build on your similarities


so i understand that your homeworld has some of the most spectacular crystal formations in this sector is there any place in particular that you would recommend i visit while im there
no
well i er whats our eta
seventeen hours thirty two minutes
i think ill go update my itinerary

what happened
theres been a systemwide power failure
whats the cause
we have entered an energy disruption field i do not recognise the configuration attitude controls failing
there is an mclass planet in this system can we reach it
i will try
inertial dampeners are offline life support is failing
entering the planets atmosphere
velocity dropping thermal shields at full power
prepare for impact

voval voval try not to move you may have a concussion picard to enterprise picard to enterprise do you read me too much interference

there is a structure of some kind some energy readings about two kilometres south of here voval im going to try to find help do you understand now try to stay conscious and dont leave the shuttle theres some kind of plasma energy out on the surface ill be back as soon as i can



the engineering sections encompass twelve decks of the secondary hull deck forty two contains the antimatter storage facility
what is the mass flow rate of the antimatter replenishment stream to the containment pods
excuse me
the antimatter replenishment rate what is it
i am not certain of the exact rate
perhaps there is someone here who does know the answer you are you smarter than this one
why do you ask
never mind
i wish to see the bussard collectors take me to them
this way

this deck is devoted mainly to stellar cartography biological research and astrophysics we have over a thousand people on board
are you sure you dont want some of this this papalla juice
no thank you im still recovering from all those desserts last night
are you sure it is very delicious
im sure
please please youve been so kind please

yum next were going to go to deck eight which is interesting because its not really finished its sort of a multipurpose deck sometimes when we need an extra lab or ambassador

what is this
its a child
child
children are our offspring theyre our young they grow into adults over a period of many years they grow into beings like us
offspring
ambassador im curious now does your species procreate
postcellular compounding we emerge from the natal pod fully grown
i see
do you have a name
eric
eric do you like dessert

may i give eric some dessert
that sounds like a wonderful idea come on eric


is someone there whos there

what do you want who are you who are you
shh
no wait stop there was someone else in the shuttlecraft with me the pilot hes injured he needs your help
hes dead


hello  smells good thank you this is a terellian cargo freighter isnt it is this your ship are you one of the crew
no i was a passenger we crashed
how many people survived were you the only one well youre certainly not a terellian unless youve lost two of your arms whats your name im jeanluc picard im a starfleet officer
anna
anna are there other people on this planet how long have you been here
i dont know you cant see the sun from here ive lost track of all time
what was the date when you crashed
stardate 
seven years
years
anna anna wait a minute
seven years i thought one maybe two how could it be seven
anna anna listen to me listen on the shuttle there is a lot of equipment that will have survived the crash we can use it to contact starfleet theyll send a ship for us we can leave
leave
yes both of us now if you will help me to get to the shuttle ow
dont move its bad
dont worry i wont move
you have three broken ribs the restrictor device will hold the bones in place let them
let them knit
its been so long since i talked to anyone i used to talk to myself but then i thought it might mean that i was crazy so i stopped talking itll be a while before you can walk
perhaps you could go to the shuttle bring the equipment back here
i can do that
good go into the cockpit and look for a small comm panel in the instrument array see if you can remove it bring it back here
dont move ill be back

i am going to kill him with my bare hands i will take him by the throat and i will rip out his oesophagus
worf
i have failed in my mission commander i am clearly a bad diplomat for the sake of the ship and the federation i request reassignment
denied
commander these iyaarans are arrogant irritating they cannot be reasoned with
ambassador loquels quite pleasant i will admit though hes a little unusual
what have you been able to find out about him so far
he seems preoccupied with recreation ive spent more time in ten forward in the last two days than i have in the past two months and hes obsessed with food especially chocolate
you must be in heaven
to be honest hes testing even my limits
you see you see they are insane
worf youve been very patient with ambassador byleth and thats good but maybe its time to let him know that some behaviour is unacceptable to us i think its all right to suggest limits for the ambassador
bah
maybe we should loosen things up a little bit meet in a less official capacity how about a friendly game of poker


what are you doing you should be in bed
anna why was this door locked from the outside
for your protection
from what
there are dangerous animals here come sit down look i have the comm panel
good
it wasnt easy i had to force it out of the equipment bay
if we can boost the output field i might be able to send a distress signal something seems to be wrong with it
whats the matter
this transmitter module has been totally destroyed how could that happen it looks as though its been hit by a phaser blast
i used a phaser to cut it free maybe i accidentally damaged it you can fix it cant you
no
im sorry im sorry im sorry
anna we will get out of here its not going to be easy but we need to work together
i cant believe i did that that i damaged our only chance ive waited for so long at first i had hoped that id be rescued i kept setting up microfusion flares and looking up at the sky and waiting for someone to come and take me away but it never happened theres a precipice near here i used to go there and stare down at the gorge and id think i can just step over the edge and end it all and then i realised it was the hope that was driving me crazy that i had to accept that i would never get out of here
anna no matter how long it takes we will get out of here
i knew from the moment i saw you that you were here to save me ill do anything you want just dont leave me i dont ever want to be alone again

i love you

i found some coltayin roots theyre not much to look at but they taste good what are you doing youre going to hurt yourself
no no no its all right im just trying to dislodge this power cell nearly got it there no no its all right the energy relays are corroded but i think it should be able to hold one more charge if i can regenerate this then i may be able to reactivate the shuttlecrafts engines
well id say this is cause for celebration i may still have some terellian spices around here and ill boil these roots and make us a nice broth
that sounds delightful
if we ever do get out of here will you promise to show me this starship of yours this enterprise
of course anna would you pass me that tricorder im going to try to repair these energy relays
i meant what i said before i do love you
anna im grateful to you for saving my life and i think that you are a warm and compassionate person and i feel a great sympathy for what youve been through alone here on this planet but i dont think that you can really be in love with me
how can you say that of course i love you
no im the first person youve seen in seven years im bringing you the hope of leaving this place dont you think that you could possibly be just a little confused right now
so youre not attracted to me
i think thats a little premature we hardly know anything about each other
i understand and im sorry if i made you uncomfortable
no harm done its going to take at least a couple of hours to charge this cell then as soon as its done we should get it over to the shuttle immediately this cell casing is already beginning to break down anna we are going to get out of here


the bet is ten thats to you ambassador
i will see the bet and raise ten
im in for twenty
 im in and i raise twenty
you are  bluffing

excuse me ambassador those are my chips
you are in error those chips are mine
i saw you take two chips from my pile
you would dare to accuse me of stealing
yes
you are lying because you are losing the game
i am losing because youve been cheating all along
wait a minute calm down
 even if i were cheating how would a plodding animal like you know it
you are an insulting pompous fool and if you were not an ambassador i would disembowel you right here
do not let my title inhibit you klingon

yes good

stop mister worf that is an order
wonderful very good thank you lieutenant worf i think i understand now that was a very effective demonstration
what
if youll excuse me i would like to document this experience

the power cell is ready we should take it over to the shuttle
no we cant leave right now
why not
the plasma storms are too strong its dangerous wait a few hours then we can go
we dont have a few hours i told you this cell is already beginning to degenerate
jeanluc its a difficult journey the restriction field will make it very hard for you to walk
im feeling very much better in fact i dont intend to go on using this any longer
no you cant remove it yet no

theres no pain it would appear i dont have any broken ribs after all
jeanluc
whats going on why are you trying to keep me here
please i love you
why are you keeping me locked in this freighter you say that there are wild animals out there but i havent heard or seen a single one of them
jeanluc
what about that comm panel you said you damaged it when you were cutting it out of the shuttle did you you see i find it hard to believe that you would destroy the one piece of equipment that could get you out of here after seven years and what was this really for to keep me immobilised
i was afraid i didnt want you to leave me
so it was necessary to keep me captive
i was scared i wanted you to stay to love me
im going to go look for the shuttle myself
no

anna
dont fight me
anna no

you should love me now were together we depend on each other i know more about you love me
anna stop
ive failed you dont love me its over
anna  anna anna where are you going

hello is anyone in there
yes inside here
hello
inside the freighter the door is on the opposite side  over here the doors over here

voval i thought you were dead
dead
yes theres a woman living here she told me that shed been to the shuttle she said that she saw you dead
yes that is understandable when my species is injured our metabolic rate slows until our body can heal itself this state could easily be mistaken for death
i see
when you did not return to the shuttle i intended to track you surface conditions made it very difficult so cold i saw someone running away from here was it the woman
yes
why did she leave the shelter
she was upset
do you think she may harm herself theres a dangerous precipice near here she was headed in that direction
its possible
then we should go find her
you stay here keep warm ill go and look for her
we will go together


anna anna
captain this ridge extends for a kilometre in either direction
we can search it twice as fast if we separate

anna anna

anna anna
stay away from me
you dont have to do this i found voval the shuttle pilot hes still alive he can help us get away from here
i dont care ill jump unless you promise to love me
no no i wont promise you have been manipulating me havent you
jeanluc what are you saying
the necklace it broke i saw it in the cargo freighter on the floor by the fire i left it there now its around your neck its whole how
tell me you love me i must know
wheres voval isnt it convenient that he arrived moments after you left that he insisted that i come here to look for you that i find you here on the ledge ready to jump thats very good timing dont you think
jeanluc
are you and voval working together hes the only one who could have brought you the necklace
tell me about your love or ill jump
go ahead why dont you do it its a long way down must be two hundred metres youd die instantly if thats what you want but i dont think that it really is

i have failed
failed voval what is going on
my name is ambassador voval
ambassador
my mission was to study human intimacy specifically the concept you call love in our study of your culture we did not understand certain concepts so we sent three representatives to study them to experience them
but why did you believe that bringing me here would give you a better understanding of love
several years ago we discovered the remains of the terellian freighter on this planet the ship contained logs made by a single survivor a human woman that was our first contact with human culture the woman lived alone here for seven years until another human crashed on this planet a human male
and the man was injured and she nursed him back to health and they fell in love
in the logs she described many concepts we found difficult to understand pleasure antagonism love these were alien to us we wished to experience them for ourselves ambassador loquel was sent to experience pleasure byleth was sent to experience antagonism and i was sent to experience love was this wrong
let me just say that we would not take such a direct approach ambassador i have tell you that in my culture what you have done would be considered a crime
crime
well well can talk about it later for now i think we should get off this planet am i in assuming the damage the shuttle is not as bad as it seems
that is correct we can leave at any time
i think that now would be quite nice

you look a little sore
lieutenant worf was kind enough to engage me in eleven hours of holodeck battle exercises
eleven hours
yes i learned a great deal about the concept of antagonism
 it was excruciating
counsellor these are bioenzymatic supplements my people consume for food im afraid you will find they are not as delicious as your chocolate
after the past few days i could use something a little bland goodbye ambassador
 fascinating species
indeed

thank you captain this has been an enlightening experience
for me as well ambassador
i am sorry if our diplomatic methods offended you
no on the contrary i found your approach intriguing we humans tend to take a rather balanced approach towards life never too much never too little and its very nice to find a culture that is willing to take an experience to its furthest extreme
goodbye captain
ambassador
interface



geordi have you found it yet
not yet im starting to get some fumes ammonia chlorine potassium chloride

i can feel the heat from here

there it is
how far
about ten metres up the odn line boy its hot id say over two thousand degrees im going in

were okay ive activated the emergency suppression system


all his vital functions are completely normal
the interface unit is operating within expected parameters
why did he start coughing when he went through the gasses
psychosomatic response
 i feel like im actually here i mean there in the jefferies tube its funny when i saw the smoke i couldnt help but cough
no one else has reported so complete a sensory experience
the interface is perfect for geordi because his visor inputs allow the probe to transmit information directly into his cerebral cortex
it looks like this is going to work geordi id like to get the probe out of the jefferies tube and onto the launch bay before we reach marijne seven
will do wait a minute

somethings wrong cant get my left leg to work

what is it
the probe is designed to respond to any movement geordi intends to make when his brain sends a message to move his leg the interface should move the probe instead
apparently the tactile sensors are too low i will increase the input

there it goes im on my way down

why the body suit
it provides tactile sensations so that geordi can feel hes in the same environment as the probe

geordi whats wrong
nothing im seeing my reflection in a panel

i forgot what a handsome guy i am
captains log stardate  we are responding to a distress call from the science vessel raman which is apparently trapped inside the turbulent atmosphere of an unusual gas giant planet we will use an experimental interface probe in our attempt to rescue it

i have reviewed the vessels mission plans the raman was to descend to the lower atmosphere eleven thousand kilometres below its current position the crew was to sample the atmosphere at that level and then return to a safer orbit
something must have happened down there maybe the shields failed or they had some kind of inversion reaction in the nacelles
any life signs
our biosensors are useless theres too much interference in the atmosphere
the crew might still be alive theres no way we can tell from up here
will the probe be able to transmit through that interference
the probe sends information via a focused particle beam it should be able to cut through the interference
but we may have to operate the probe at close to tolerance levels
will your nervous system be able to handle that much sensory input
weve already tested the interface at about seventy percent tolerance
we shouldnt have any trouble going higher the safety override will kick in at about ninety eight percent tolerance and thatll disengage the interface
captain i am receiving a transmission from starfleet command admiral holt
in my ready room the seven people on that ship are our first priority is the probe ready for launch
yes sir
send it directly to the aft section of the raman through the secondary air lock that way it should put it just one bulkhead away from the bridge
ill interface with the probe as soon as its ready take it the rest of the way from there
make it so

hello marcus
jeanluc
hows life on ds three
were hosting this years palio the ferengi have already been accused of trying to bribe the breen pilot into throwing the race
theres nothing unusual about that
nothing at all i wish i could say i was just calling to catch up on things nine days ago the hera left here on a routine courier mission we were in contact with them for five of those days then the ship disappeared without a trace
the hera
im afraid so the excelsior and the noble have been retracing its course for the last seventy two hours nothing im going to keep them at it for another seventy two but to be honest i dont think another week would make any difference
ill inform commander la forge

mister data id like a word with commander la forge
aye sir i will be on the bridge

geordi ive just spoken with starfleet the hera is missing
missing my mother
captain la forge has disappeared along with the rest of her crew


i saw your father last week and your sister about ten days before that i decided i missed my favourite son
your only son ma
youre going to have to see the hera again weve got a lot of new faces on board including a chief engineer who juices up the nacelles every chance she gets i think shes the best technician in the fleet okay second best

come in
im sorry i didnt know you were
dont worry about it
maybe you should meet her were going to be in the same sector next week take a shuttle over and ill introduce you
my mothers always trying to find me a wife
but if youre too busy ill see you at your fathers birthday party remember if you talk to him its a surprise

this came in about three weeks ago i never got back to her
geordi the probe has entered the planets atmosphere and im ready to take it onto the ship if you would like to take a couple of days off ill run the interface
the interface is calibrated specifically to my visors inputs it would take you at least ten hours to convert it and those crewmen down there cant wait
the interface doesnt have to be fully compatible i could run it right now i wouldnt have the same control that you have but it would still work
forget it im the best person for the job and theres no reason why we shouldnt proceed as planned
the hera is reason enough
the hera is missing thats all now until i hear something different my mother might just as well have taken the crew on an unscheduled holiday lets go

captain the probe is through the airlock and in position aboard the raman
picard to commander data report

we are ready to bring the interface online sir
proceed
activating the remote sensors initiating interface now
vital signs normal geordi how do you feel
fine
do you have visual contact
not yet

data turn up the input sensors im not seeing anything
acknowledged
okay i can see

but no colours
increasing signal strength to seventy five percent of tolerance
ah thats better
your pulse has gone up your nervous system probably has to get used to the input levels
im excited thats all doctor this is like being on a roller coaster or a first date im all right
ill be the judge of that if your heart rate gets too high were going to disconnect you
understood

its a mess in here there must be a breach in the hull someplace im picking up atmospheric gasses in the corridor methane and ammonia primarily that break in the hull might even be on the bridge itself im heading towards the bridge ive found someone
what is your position
about twelve metres up the main corridor hes trapped under some conduit from the bulkhead i cant move it im going to need more power to the tractor beam
go to eighty percent of tolerance data no higher

hes dead data that door at the end of this corridor whats it lead to
a magnetic storage bay
if there was a break in the bridge thatd be the safest place to go data give me a phaser burst narrow focus level four intensity

ive found them theyre dead all of them theres a fire in here argh

data disconnect what happened geordi
i dont know my hands
theyre burned


how did this happen
there was some kind of energy discharge in the interface suit
but shouldnt the safety overrides have prevented that
yes but i have a theory why they didnt the tolerance levels of the interface were set extremely high i think geordis neural response to the input was so strong that it created a feedback loop
the sensors that were transmitting the sensation of heat to my hands mustve overloaded
the crew of the raman are dead i would like to retrieve them and their vessel but not if it means putting geordis safety at risk
if we turn down the sensory input on the probe i should be fine seven people lost their lives down there captain we should at least retrieve the information they were collecting
doctor
if we operate the interface at lower input levels id say the risk is acceptable
picard to riker
riker here
we will proceed with the probe

well have to take it into the ramans auxiliary control room their bridge is too badly damaged

how long before you have it in position
a couple of hours we have to cut through the bulkhead
acknowledged
well it looks like youll have time to recuperate
yeah theres something ive got to do anyway


how are you dad
as well as expected under the circumstances are you okay
yeah
i spoke with your sister this morning she said shell be in touch with you in a few days right now shes pretty upset the service for the hera will probably be on vulcan most of the crew was from there but your sister and i want to have a private ceremony
dad dont you think everybodys jumping the gun here last i heard there were still two starships out there looking for them theyve found no debris no residual warp distortion
and no ship
not yet but that doesnt mean they wont
starfleet is considering the hera lost the search isnt much more than a formality at this point geordi your mothers gone
yeah well you can think that if you want but until i see some hard evidence im not going to give up hope
all right geordi call me if you need anything


come in
hey data still working
no i have completed the adjustments on the interface i am now waiting for commander riker to finish moving the probe do you need to be comforted
no i was just passing by i was wondering what you were up to
i am using the time to catch up on my study of poetry
data theres nothing on the screen
that is not entirely correct while it is true the display is currently blank this emptiness has a poetic meaning therefore it cannot be considered nothing as such
says who
the ancient doosodarians much of their poetry contained such lacunae or empty spaces often these pauses measured several days in length during which poet and audience were encouraged to fully acknowledge the emptiness of the experience
i remember a few lectures from starfleet academy that seemed like that
are you certain you do not wish to talk about your mother
why would you ask that
you are no doubt feeling emotional distress as a result of her disappearance while you claim to be just passing by that is most likely an excuse to start a conversation about this uncomfortable subject am i correct
no data sometimes just passing by means just passing by
then i apologise for my premature assumption this particular poem has a lacuna of forty seven minutes you may experience the emptiness with me if you wish
thanks  you know data maybe you gave up a little too easily
i do not understand
well when i said just passing by means just passing by i really didnt mean it
my initial assumption was correct you do wish to speak of your mother
am i crazy to think that shes still alive
your sanity is not in question however your evaluation of the available information is biased
shes a starship captain shes gotten herself into and out of impossible situations before why should this be any different
disappearances fitting the profile of the hera have rarely ended with the safe recovery of ship and crew
well that makes me feel much better look im sorry data i didnt mean to snap at you
i am not offended you are upset your reactions are not surprising
its just that if she really is dead i dont know what im going to do

were receiving the probes telemetry
the input levels are currently at fifty three percent of tolerance
thats too low data i wont be able to do anything down there
i want to start with as wide a margin of safety as possible we can adjust upward later ready
go ahead
initiating interface
i cant see anything

i am increasing the input now
yeah yeah thats better but i need more
is this level sufficient geordi geordi do you hear me

mom mom is it you
is it you
oh i forgot all you can see is this probe yes its me im actually on the enterprise im interfaced with this probe

geordi who are you speaking to what are you seeing

but is it really you
yes geordi its mom
but bow can that be i mean how is it possible
theres no time to explain we have to go down
down where
the surface

geordi report

hang on doctor why why do we have to go down to the surface
were dying
we the hera you mean the hera is down there
were disconnecting you right now
no wait
we need your help i need your help geordi
mom


the cut off has been automatically activated
hes in neural shock

the sensory overload didnt cause any permanent damage but i wouldnt want to expose his brain to that kind of stimulus again
is there any indication what caused this hallucination
his brain functions are normal
i told you i wasnt hallucinating
geordi i have analysed the probes sensor logs there are no record to indicate the presence of a living human on board the raman
well she wasnt actually there her ship is down on the surface
so you believe that what you saw was some kind of transmission
somehow she has managed to communicate with me
we have no indication of a transmission of any kind
maybe im the only one who can detect it because im interfaced with the probe
the probe does allow geordi to sense quantum fluctuations subspace anomalies and other phenomenon not perceptible by any other kind of sensors
granted but how could he perceive his mother visually as if she were standing there in the room
im not sure i do know that our brains werent designed to process the kind of sensory information geordi was getting when the brain receives something it cant understand it interprets the input as best it can sometimes as a smell or a sound sometimes visually
you see
but geordi im not saying that your mother was really communicating with you im just trying to give you a reason why you mightve thought that she was
look im telling you my mothers ship is trapped down there and weve got to help them
geordi the heras last reported location was three hundred light years away how could it end up here
if the hera is on the surface its hull could not possibly withstand the pressure of the atmosphere
well at least let me go back down there just to be sure
i do not recommend that he use the interface again the sensory overload almost killed you
ill be all right
no no im sorry geordi im not prepared to risk your life data find another way of salvaging the raman i want an alternate plan in two hours

geordi id like you to talk to counsellor troi shes expecting you
aye sir

whats your mother like geordi
if you think im going to start talking about my childhood counsellor youre way off
thats not what i asked
well shes shes brilliant funny shes incredibly perceptive she knows people knows what theyre all about even before they open their mouths shes always been that way shes a real good judge of character
when was the last time you saw her
about seven months ago when she first took command of the hera i went to a party she had for her crew she wanted me to come over and see her but i was really busy at the time i mean i suppose i could have made the time to go and see her but you know i just didnt think that i mean you know i i didnt think that
you didnt think it would be your last chance to see her
thats not what i was going to say
i want to suggest something call it a theory all right
all right
youre worried about the disappearance of your mother guilty that you didnt see her when you had the chance so youre unwilling to consider that she might be dead your need to believe shes alive is so strong that it manifests itself as a physical image
but she told me shes trapped on that planet that shes in danger now if this was some kind of wish fulfillment dont you think id be fantasising her safe and sound
no because that would be the end of your fantasy youd know it wasnt true the more involved and complicated and unending your story is the longer you can believe your mothers still alive
yeah well thats your theory counsellor ive got one of my own
gambit part 



 so tell me why is it so important that you find this man
we had business dealings he owes me money
if we had business dealings i can tell you that i wouldnt disappear
maybe we can discuss that possibility but first i have to find him collect the money im owed
ill be closing in a few hours perhaps we can discuss this more privately
if i dont find him im going to have to move on are you sure you havent seen him
human about two metres tall smoothheaded no i dont remember anyone like that
youre lying
and youre a betazoid i thought so listen people who come in here they count on a certain amount of anonymity and if i were to start answering questions about them even to a very beautiful woman well i wouldnt be in business very long and being a businesswoman im sure you understand

great story ill remember it next time im in a knife fight

any luck
i think the one over there knows something
he would not admit to having seen the captain but he said that anyone who visited the ruins of nafir would probably come here eventually i suspect he knows more
lets go
commander i told
my friend tells me you know about the man were looking for
the only reason im talking to you is that i have a sister too
i explained to him that we are looking for a man who impregnated your sister
so you can imagine how much this means to me
family honour is important if someone had defiled my sister i would do anything pay anything to find the one responsible
and how much might anything be
as much as five bars of goldpressed latinum
i think youve had a little too much to drink youd better leave on your way yranac

im sorry but i think he wants to stay sit down
this is my sister shes angry shes got a vicious temper i wouldnt cross her
you say one word and youre a dead man
perhaps theres an element of risk here that i did not fully appreciate
and how much more latinum will it take to offset this risk
this isnt about latinum as a man with a sister a sister with a temper i can sympathise with you but how did you come here do you have a ship in orbit
yes
then take me with you you can drop me anywhere
agreed now talk
the man youre looking for was here several weeks ago there was a group of aliens sitting at this table he was asking them questions
who were these aliens
i dont know but they looked dangerous they attacked him he managed to incapacitate three of them before he was knocked down he was thrown against that wall and fell there

im picking up some starfleet fibre traces and human cellular debris
can you establish a dna reading
theres something strange here the cell structures are badly distorted its as if theyve been exposed to some kind of highenergy field
a weapon discharge
it could be im picking up some faint traces of microcrystalline damage in the floor material but im not familiar with the pattern im getting
who are you people
you didnt say anything about a weapon
i hadnt finished yet youll like this the man got what was coming to him when they knocked him down one of them took out a weapon and fired he was vaporised
hes telling the truth
acting captains log stardate  doctor crusher has positively identified captain picards dna theres no doubt now that hes dead

come
how are you doing
im all right
the crews pretty shaken up im arranging a memorial i think you should be the one to deliver the eulogy
i think youd be better at something like that or beverly she knew him the longest
i know its not going to be easy but i think its important that we face up to whats happened youre in command now the crews looking to you for guidance
you dont understand i cant give the eulogy because i wont be at the service
a memorial service helps to give everyone a sense of completion helps them begin the healing process
thats exactly the point i dont want to heal
will
ive an open wound right here it hurts like hell i dont want it to get better and i dont want to pretend that everythings all right
i know youre angry
youre damn right and i intend to stay angry until i find whoevers responsible for the captains death
thats pretty selfish of you do you think youre the only one in pain do you think you have the monopoly on loss well let me tell you something were all hurting and were all angry and whether you like it or not you have a responsibility to this crew and you cant just indulge your personal desire for revenge
that is enough counsellor deanna im sorry this is not about revenge this is about justice the captain died in a bar fight for nothing somebody has to answer for that then i can mourn

commander i am receiving a transmission from admiral chekote at starbase two twenty seven
ill take it in the ready room
aye sir

sir
 i read your report commander my condolences to you and your crew captain picards death is a loss to the entire federation i see that youve asked to postpone your mission to the argus sector for what reason
i have a request sir i would like to conduct an investigation into captain picards death
the dessican authorities have jurisdiction in this case commander
i know that sir frankly i dont have much confidence in the authorities on dessica two theres every reason to believe that theyre corrupt
i suspect youre right the question remains are you the one to pursue this
the captains death hit me pretty hard and i may not be completely objective but there is no one who is more determined i wont rest until i find out whos responsible
all right commander im officially placing the enterprise on detached duty your mission is at your discretion good luck
thank you sir


ah commander riker ive been meaning to speak to you i was wondering if you could move me to better quarters i dont care much for the decor here
these are the best quarters we have i was hoping now that youve had a chance to relax you might have remembered some of the details about the aliens you saw something you may have forgotten
sorry my memory isnt what it used to be
they murdered a man in cold blood in full view of everyone in the bar and you cant remember anything about them
now that you mention it i do remember one thing they said theyd kill anyone who talked about what happened
do you know where they went  so you know who they are and you know where i can find them
perhaps i do
what do you want
not a great deal commander just a shuttlecraft i believe id like to travel for a while see more of the galaxy you understand
a shuttlecraft well heres my offer instead of the ship ill give you some time
time
if youre lucky youll only spend the next five years in prison instead of the next twenty  youve got twelve outstanding arrest warrants for fraud and petty theft in the klingon empire tell me what you know and ill pull some strings maybe theyll reduce your sentence after youve been extradited
if i tell you what i know you must promise not to give me to the klingons
ill think about it
perhaps you could send me to a federation rehabilitation colony instead
talk
the aliens were some kind of mercenary group theyve been operating in this sector for the last six months
where do we find them
i heard one of them mention the barradas system i think they were headed there
you think
thats all i know
riker to data
data here
take us out of orbit set course for the barradas system warp six
aye sir

barradas three is the only class m planet in this system and it is listed as unpopulated however sensors have detected intermittent energy signals emanating from its surface
whats the source
the signals are difficult to localise but they could be emissions from some kind of power converter
which could indicate a base or a ship
what else do we know about barradas three
the planet was used as an outpost for the debrune approximately two thousand years ago the federations archaeological survey has catalogued numerous ruins on the surface
mister worf id like a security detail to accompany the away team to the surface ill lead the team geordi youre with me mister data you have the bridge
aye sir commander as acting first officer i must question your decision to accompany the away team if captain picard were here
hes not
i realise that sir but if he were and he wanted to lead an away team you would tell him that the captains place is
on the bridge not this time

ensign you take that area
yes sir
geordi
its tough to get accurate sensor readings theres an awful lot of interference in the area
from what
im not sure its very unlocalised it could be atmospheric
what do you make of these

well these ruins around here are pretty ancient but id say that this indentation was made fairly recently could be the site of some battlefield
it doesnt look like any blast point ive ever seen the shape is too perfect
sir theres microcrystalline damage all throughout this area the same kind of pattern that doctor crusher picked up in the floor of that bar on dessica two
commander i found something

looks as if someone could have just dropped them

la forge to enterprise we are under attack down here

i repeat we are under attack
 commander weve lost contact with the away team
is there a malfunction
no sir the comm system is being jammed
what is the source
somewhere on the surface
bridge to transporter room two can you get a lock on the away team
negative sir theres too much interference


 im going to head for those trees over there if i can get there we might be able to set up a crossfire

data to away team please respond
data weve been attacked

weve got one casualty and commander riker has been taken captive

sir the mercenaries have beamed away they must have a base or a ship nearby can the sensors locate anything

commander were picking up a vessel leaving orbit
why was it not detected earlier
they could have been using the planet as a shield sir they are powering up their weapon systems
raise shields red alert

damage report
minor hit on the port deflector no damage theyre running sir their speed is warp eight point seven and holding i think theyre at their maximum
take us to warp nine and pursue lock phasers on target
sir we should be within phaser range in twenty three seconds switching to longrange scanners commander the sensor image of that ship is extremely weak its fading the ship doesnt register on the longrange sensors im sorry sir weve lost them
increase the sensor field bandwidth patch in the lateral sensor arrays
its no good the signals gone it just disappeared
plot a course and take us back to barradas three notify the away team to prepare for transport
aye sir

starfleet intelligence confirms that a ship matching this configuration has been linked to raids on several other planets in this sector for the short time it was within our visual range we were able to take sensor readings of the mercenary vessel it appears to be encased in an energy absorbing material although we can see the ship this energy sheath renders it virtually undetectable to our long range sensors
there must be some way we can track it
data i know this is a long shot but if i remodulate the long range sensor array i might be able to make it sensitive enough to detect the ship
without a full compositional analysis of the energy sheath the chances of finding the correct remodulation sequence are remote
sir they have taken commander riker we must do something we cannot just sit here
on the contrary lieutenant that is precisely what we must do since there are no viable alternatives we will return to the surface and attempt to determine what these mercenaries are doing on this planet an investigation might reveal some indication of their purpose please notify me when you have assembled your search teams dismissed


 whats the problem
 i warned you not to push the engines so hard two of the power shunts are on the verge of collapse well be lucky if we can maintain warp six
how long will it take to repair
i can try to realign the warp core itll take at least eleven hours but ill have to shut the engines down completely
were not stopping we cant afford to be sitting helpless in space i want warp eight available in five hours and i dont want to hear your excuses

what were you doing on barradas three
william t riker commander sc two three one dash four two seven
oh really well i am arctus baran and i dont have a number now what were you doing on barradas three commander
we were studying the ruins it was a scientific expedition
dont patronise me those ruins have been studied for centuries theres nothing new to learn from them
then what were you doing there

dont bother commander you cant remove it its a neural servo connected directly to your nervous system it lets me control precisely how much pain you feel this setting is usually sufficient however if necessary it can go much higher these devices were the idea of my predecessor its a convenient way of enforcing discipline
what happened to him
he failed to enforce it with me
 this is a waste of time baran get rid of him now
you should be more patient vekor it might be rewarding we will wait let the memory of his pain argue with him for a while it might change his attitude

vekor is right we should get rid of him its dangerous to have someone from starfleet on board
dangerous it might be profitable a starfleet commander is a valuable hostage
starfleet wont negotiate with us but theyll pursue us as long as we have him

this discussion is over get back to your post vekor

theyre right baran and you know it i say kill him now

if he has nothing to give us we should kill him now and be done with it everyone seems to recognise that fact except you
i dont need a consensus to run this ship galen

whats going on
im bypassing the aft plasma couplings the power loss should only last for a few seconds
you should learn not to limit your options riker could be very useful to us in the future
he may not be as useful as you think if this is the same riker that ive heard about
and what riker might that be
commander of the enterprise formerly assigned to the uss hood
thats right
then you must be the william t riker with a history of insubordination he was even once relieved of duty during the cardassian incident at minos korva
how do you know all this
look ive been smuggling artefacts from federation sites for years you cant help developing a familiarity with certain starfleet personnel if we hadnt have captured him hed probably have ended up before a court martial
ive gotten out of them before
look hes no use to us finish him now let me do it for you

 watch him
were accelerating
what have you done
it has nothing to do with my repairs i think theres a malfunction in the engines intermix chamber
plasma pressure is rising
wheres the malfunction
it could be one of any thirty subsystems itll take time to locate
i dont think youre going to have the chance plasma pressure has reached critical levels
seal off the intermix chamber
i cant the override sequence wont engage
the antimatter flow regulator is locked open
logic subsystems still not responding
 get out of the way
plasma pressure has exceeded maximum levels eight percent above critical and rising
we have to jettison the core
no well be stranded here
the flow regulator is frozen
let me do it ive had a lot of experience with this sort of system failures i might be able to do something
plasma pressure is eleven percent above critical the containment fields are beginning to degrade
go
flow regulator is not responding to manual override containment fields wont hold much longer
looks like youve got a control logic lockout in your regulator subsystem im going to attempt to run an active bypass through the plasma flow convertor you  start running phaselock feedback through that regulator i want about a six second delay
what are you saying i dont take orders from you
you do as he says
plasma pressure is fourteen percent above critical
if you fail
well all be dead anyway just need a few more seconds
plasma pressure is dropping were back into safe levels
if you want to make sure that doesnt happen again youd better reinitiate your regulator subcompressors a full diagnostic of your intermix chamber wouldnt hurt either
do it put him in quarters for now
 you still wish youd killed me

the search teams have reported in they found several archaeological sites each one has been looted
its possible that the microcrystalline damage i found in these indentations was the result of some kind of high energy transporter beam but i still dont understand theres nothing here thats particularly valuable why would anyone want to steal any of these things
perhaps these artefacts have a special value to the romulans
the romulans
these structures were built by the debrune that race is an ancient offshoot of the romulans the ruins on the planet where captain picard was killed were also romulan in origin
the leader of the group that attacked us was romulan perhaps they are controlling the mercenaries
the question remains why are they stealing these artefacts

there are several archaeological sites in this sector containing ruins which are romulan in origin these are the locations that were attacked by the mercenary vessel
looks like they did a pretty thorough job
the only sites not been attacked were on calder two yadalla prime and draken four
yadalla and draken are at the far edge of the sector but calder two thats less than a day from here at maximum warp
that would be their next likely target
according to this theres a federation outpost at calder two
but it is only a small science station it has limited defensive capabilities i do not believe it could withstand an attack from the mercenary ship mister worf send a message to the federation outpost on calder two advise them that if a ship matching the mercenary vessel approaches they should attempt to delay it until our arrival ensign take us out of orbit set course for the calder system warp nine
 aye sir

we dont have much time its good to see you will i didnt expect to meet you here
i was looking to find the people who killed you on the surface a witness said they saw you vaporised
these mercenaries use weapons that can activate their transporter it gives them the opportunity to beam things quickly just by firing at them thats what they did to me
i dont understand any of this who are these people what are you doing involved with them
the site that i wanted to study had been raided a lot of the artefacts had been stolen the site had been practically destroyed i wanted to find out who was responsible i tracked them to that bar on dessica two i must have asked too many questions they captured me they wanted to find out how much i knew about their operation
and then you became part of their crew
i convinced them i was a smuggler and that my name was galen i offered to help them appraise the artefacts that they had stolen will these arent common thieves they are stealing romulan artefacts from archaeological sites throughout this sector baran has me analysing each one if them for a particular particle signature will they are looking for a specific artefact
why
thats what we have to find out baran is the key i think that he knows more about what were really looking for than anyone else on this ship i want you to get close to him try and get his confidence
thats why you set up the engine failure because you knew that id be able to fix it
he also believes that youre a less than perfect starfleet officer will i want you to play into that role baran and i well he doesnt care very much for me but he has to tolerate me because he needs my help with these artefacts but if you and i become enemies then theres a better chance of you and he becoming friends
all right ill do what i can

what are you doing here
getting some answers because you cant get him to talk

no one conducts an interrogation on this ship without my permission is that understood


our next objective should prove an interesting challenge were headed for the sakethan burial mounds on calder two
what calder two isnt just another archaeological site you know its a federation outpost there
i dont see that as a problem
its defended by starfleet you dont think theyre just going to stand by while we walk in there and take whatever we want
im familiar with the tactical situation
what are their defences
nothing to worry about they have a type four deflector shield protecting the outpost and the ruins
they also have a minimum of two phaser banks and possibly photon torpedoes is that enough to worry about
how do you know so much about this outpost
because i tried to smuggle a sakethan glyph stone out of there nearly two years ago i barely got away in one piece
our weapons are more than a match for their defences i anticipate that well be able to destroy the outpost within fifteen minutes then well send in tallera and the landing party to secure the relics
why dont we use riker hes a starfleet commander he could talk us past the outpost security without raising their suspicions then when their shields go down we can beam the artefacts up here without ever leaving the ship
why would riker help us just because hes out of favour with starfleet doesnt mean that hes ready to betray them
if he doesnt help us well have to destroy the outpost and kill everyone on it hes still a starfleet officer he wont want to take innocent lives if he can possibly prevent it
the last time we engaged starfleet we lost a man we cant afford any more casualties if we can avoid a battle i think we should
all right well try it well be at calder two within five hours you all know your duties i want this ship prepared for battle in case your plan doesnt work


computer reset diagnostic for new sample lot number four seven eight b access spectral analysis and begin scan mode three

baran wants to see the analysis of the last lot he thinks youre moving a little slowly
you can tell baran if he wants the analysis done faster he can do it himself if he wants it done correctly he can wait
do you enjoy living dangerously galen baran can kill you in an instant if he activates his control device
i doubt that hell do that ive increased the accuracy of the identification process by a factor of ten im the best person to analyse these artefacts baran knows that
he may need you now but i know baran and i can tell you hes not going to back down forever you accomplish nothing by provoking him
i dont like operating in the dark if i knew what the point of this mission were why i was analysing these relics
if baran felt it were wise to let the crew know that im sure he would have
do you know what all this is about
what baran knows i know
then whats going on here why are we risking our lives taking these artefacts who wants them
i see no reason to tell you anything but you can rest assured i dont necessarily share everything i know with baran either this conversation for example will stay between us
you can tell baran every word that ive said he knows that i dont think much of him as a leader
hes been in charge of this crew for a long time
baran wouldnt last five minutes as captain if he didnt have that control device the crew follow him because they have no choice barans power is based on fear and intimidation
that almost sounds like a prelude to mutiny
if someone were to challenge him the rest of the crew would follow
i was right you do like living dangerously i like you galen i can tolerate a lot from someone like you but only to a point i intend to complete this mission successfully and get whats been promised me if it looks as though youre getting in the way of that ill deal with you myself

commander no one is allowed on the surface without prior authorisation from the federation science council
im aware of that lieutenant but your outpost is in imminent danger of attack i would like to station security personnel on the surface for your protection now im ordering you to drop your shields
im sorry sir but the regulations are very specific i cant do it if youd like you can remain in orbit until we contact the science council but were experiencing some communication difficulties right now so that

this isnt working theyre delaying on purpose someone has warned them charge main disruptor array destroy the outpost

no theres no time for that starfleet will be here any minute
what are you doing
im configuring the disruptors to fire a phase resonant pulse if i can hit their shield generator with precisely the right frequency i should be able to take it out with one shot firing their shields are down
the artefacts should be located in several small structures arranged in staggered formations
im scanning i think ive found them
lock coordinates and start bringing them up

there should be at least two more pieces down there
ive lost transporter lock
they managed to get their shields back up
i need those artefacts lock all disruptors on target this time i want that outpost destroyed


direct hit on their aft deflectors they are undamaged
ensign scan for starfleet combadge signals is commander riker aboard that ship
i cant tell sir sensors are unable to penetrate their hull
open a channel
open
this is the federation starship enterprise you are ordered to stand down

drop your shields and prepare to be boarded
you sent them a message you told them where to find us
thats ridiculous when did i have a chance
this is set to kill order your ship to disengage activate visual

commander are you all right

tell him
mister data withdraw the enterprise thats an order

that is impossible sir the ship you are on has violated a federation outpost it is my duty to stop it
im your commanding officer im giving you a direct order understood
commander if you could explain

ive never explained my orders before im not about to start now

i wont let him blow this ship into space if i can set up a low level comm link between the two ships i can use my personal command codes i can deactivate the shields
do it

commander we are receiving some kind of signal from the mercenary ship these are commander rikers access codes he is attempting to shut down our shields
that doesnt make any sense he knows those codes would have been changed as soon as he was captured
that is correct counsellor he does know mister worf prepare to drop the shields
sir we would be totally defenceless
i am aware of that
sir as soon as they see
mister worf that is an order
aye sir

it worked the shields are dropping
fire

to be continued
gambit part 

the next generation
my friend tells me you might know about the man were looking for
there was a group of aliens sitting at this table he was asking them questions one of them took out a weapon and fired he was vapourised
this is about justice the captain died in a bar fight for nothing

those ruins have been studied for centuries theres nothing new to learn from them
then what were you doing there
baran wouldnt last five minutes as captain if he didnt have that control device
that almost sounds like a prelude to mutiny
they captured me to find out how much i knew about their operation
then you became a member of their crew
i convinced them i was a smuggler will these are not common thieves they are stealing romulan artefacts from archeological sites throughout this sector
mister worf prepare to drop shields
sir we would be totally defenceless
i am aware of that
fire
and now the conclusion


direct hit to the port nacelle only minimal damage hit to the starboard nacelle still no appreciable damage
will mustve done something to their weapons
i believe you are right counsellor it is now up to us to play along release inertial dampers and cut power to decks thirty one through thirty seven
aye sir
set phasers to twenty five percent return fire
aye sir

continue firing
ive lost three plasma relays on the disruptors auxiliary power is is not available
transfer weapons control to my station theres a way to bypass the relays and feed power

the antimatter containment units are starting to buckle
the enterprise has been badly damaged but they still have superior firepower if we remain here we will be destroyed the logical course of action is to withdraw
weve done enough damage narik set course one eight zero mark two one five warp six initiate

theyre preparing to activate their warp drive commander
sir we cannot be able to track them with our sensors if they go to warp i can still disable them
i am aware of the tactical situation lieutenant let them go

ive gone over every word every inflection every facial response and i still cant find any kind of code or hidden message
i agree the existence of such a message is remote but i believe we should check
ill keep trying
two starships have been sent to intercept the mercenaries at yadalla prime and draken four in case they attempt to attack those planets
inform starfleet command that we will hold this position until further notice
so we are just going to remain here
yes but we will continue to pursue all avenues of investigation
if we had not let them to escape this would not be necessary
that is correct but i believe commander riker wanted us to let them escape
commander i think ive got something ive been studying the comm link commander riker used to transmit his command codes i didnt see anything at first but then i ran the transmission through a subharmonic analysis i found this it was sent by the same carrier wave as the command codes
it might be the message weve been looking for
possibly i will attempt to resequence the signal begin running a search for a decryption key


im taking the engines offline
how long will it take to repair our battle damage
it will take at least five hours to replace the antimatter containment unit
you have three hours narik one minute beyond that and youll answer for it with your life i suppose i should thank you none of us would be alive if it werent for you
youre welcome
whats wrong commander you having second thoughts about betraying your comrades because thats what youve done betrayed them betrayed them in order to save yourself you used to be just a second rate officer now youre a traitor and a coward how does that feel

i dont know how did that feel
thats enough galen go down to the cargo hold and check out those artefacts move


you can tell baran that im working as fast as i can what
im trying to decide if youre incredibly stupid or incredibly smart why didnt you continue to fire on the enterprise when their shields dropped
you were there the disruptors lost power computer reset for diagnostic of new sample begin scan
ive watched you handle the weapon systems before you know exactly how to bypass a problem like that and why do you continue to argue with riker it should be obvious that by alienating riker you also alienate baran and yet you continue to do so why
scan complete terikon profile negative
computer reset diagnostic for new sample and begin scan look this isnt a romulan labour camp i dont have to answer your questions and i dont give a damn what you think
scan complete terikon profile positive ninety eight percent probability of match
well whatever it is were looking for it seems weve found it
tallera to captain
yes what is it
im in the cargo hold galens made a positive terikon match on

one of the artefacts
good bring it to me immediately dont let anyone get near it
understood tallera out
that sounds like good news
very it means weve completed half of what promises to be a very profitable mission and even better than that im almost ready to get rid of your friend galen
really
theres one more artefact to find once galen confirms that its genuine his usefulness on this ship will come to a very sudden end
i cant say im sorry to hear that
galen might be a loud mouthed fool but sometimes hes quite perceptive his observations about you for instance
oh
after what you did on calder two i doubt if you have much of a future in starfleet
yes i must say ive come to the same conclusion
well assuming that you were not my prisoner what would you do now
i guess id start looking for a new career there must be a place where someone with fifteen years of starfleet technical knowledge would be useful you wouldnt happen to know a place like that
well possibly however theres one thing that i have learned on this ship and thats to be cautious and never to blindly embrace what might appear to be good fortune and right now youre a rather large stroke of good luck
i havent exactly sworn my undying allegiance to you either baran for instance id like to know a little bit more about the job
such as
such as what you meant by a very profitable mission
well its enough to know right now that your share will ensure a very wealthy and long life far from the federation
sounds promising
it is only youre going to have to earn it and you can start by putting aside your dislike for galen and becoming his friend
why
galen has allies on this ship they could cause trouble if i decide to kill him i want you to find out from him who they are
okay
one more thing riker when the time comes i want you to kill galen


i have completed my analysis of the signal from the mercenary ship i believe these groupings represent bearings and coordinates taken from their navigational system
so you think this is their flight plan
yes if i am correct the mercenary ship is heading toward these coordinates in the hyralan sector
their maximum speed is warp eight point seven it will take them at least fourteen hours to reach that position
we could be there in five
make it so
finally set course for the hyralan sector and engage at warp nine
aye sir
lieutenant may i see you in the ready room
of course

lieutenant i am dissatisfied with your performance as first officer
may i ask in what way
you continually question my orders in front of the crew i do not believe this is appropriate behaviour
with all due respect sir i have always felt free to voice my opinions even when they differ from those of captain picard or commander riker
that is true but in those situations you were acting as head of security not as first officer the primary role of the second in command is to carry out the decisions of the captain in this case me
but is it not my duty to offer you alternatives
yes but once i have made a decision it is your job to carry it out regardless of how you may personally feel any further objections should be given to me in private not in front of the crew i do not recall commander riker ever publicly showing irritation with his captain as you did a moment ago
no sir
if you do not feel capable of carrying out this role i will assign it to commander la forge and return you to tactical i would not enter it into your record as a reprimand simply as a transfer
i would prefer to remain at my current post
then i expect you to conform to the guidelines i have laid out
aye sir
dismissed mister worf i am sorry if i have ended our friendship
sir it is i who has jeopardised our friendship not you if you will overlook this incident i would like to continue to consider you my friend
i would like that as well
thank you sir


good to see you too
ive had some unpleasant surprises will this isnt a good idea baran might grow suspicious
as a matter of fact it was baran who sent me here he told me to pretend to be friendly with you and help you organise a mutiny so he can determine who your supporters in the crew and then eliminate them
what a tangled web we weave i have difficulty remembering whose side im on so what have you been able to find out
when we reach the hyralan sector were supposed to rendezvous with a klingon transport ship im not sure but i think they may be delivering another of the romulan artefacts to us
a second artefact oh by the way that first artefacts is not romulan its vulcan
vulcan
i have been looking over the glyphs and pictograms from the calder two artefact and although i dont have enough data to translate all the inscriptions the alphabet and symbology is much more consistent with early vulcan than romulan
do these artefacts have some religious or cultural significance something that would make them valuable enough to kill for
i dont know if i could just get access to the enterprise computer just for a few moments so what will baran do once hes obtained the second artefact
youre supposed to verify its authenticity and then im supposed to kill you and i take your place
will you always seem to be after my job well as soon as baran feels that ive outlived my usefulness he can kill me simply by using the neural servo so i think we had better start planning a mutiny


we need a new captain and ive come to one inescapable conclusion
i agree but i dont think thats you
oh
i dont trust you galen i dont think the rest of the crew does either theyre not going to follow you
then who will they follow you
no but they will follow tallera and so will i

who are you
what
youre no smuggler and i dont think your names galen you will tell me who you really are and what you are doing on this ship or i will kill you right here
what are you talking about
i will not play games with you i found the message you sent to the enterprise when riker was using his command codes to drop their shields you sent them a transmission on the same carrier wave youre a starfleet officer do not deny it it is the only logical conclusion my name is actually tpaal and i am a member of the vshar
vulcan security
that is correct i infiltrated this ship a year ago posing as a romulan mercenary im here to investigate a possible threat to vulcan
what sort of threat
first things first galen who are you
im captain jeanluc picard of the enterprise
very well to answer your question for several years now there has been a small but growing movement of extreme isolationists on vulcan a group that believes contact with alien races has polluted our culture and is destroying vulcan purity this group advocates the total isolation of vulcan from the rest of the galaxy and the eradication of all alien influences from our planet
that sounds like an illogical philosophy
agreed but extremists often have a logic all their own
tell me tallera what are these artefacts weve been collecting i know that they are vulcan in origin
i am sure you are familiar with the ancient history of my people before we found logic before we found peace
you were much as my people once were savage warlike
there was even a time when we used our telepathic abilities as a weapon a time when we learned to kill with a thought
the stone of gol
you know of it
i know the story from vulcan mythology
the stone of gol is real but there is nothing supernatural or magical about it it is a psionic resonator a device which focuses and amplifies telepathic energy it is one of the most devastating weapons ever conceived
but according to the legend the stone was destroyed by the gods when the vulcan people found the way to peace
the resonator was believed to have been destroyed during the time of the awakening only one piece is known to have survived and it was placed in a vulcan museum under heavy guard a year ago that piece was stolen from the museum soon after mercenary ships began raiding archaeological sites across the quadrant we believe a member of the isolationist movement is attempting to reassemble the resonator
a telepathic weapon
my orders are to find that assassin and stop him
it would seem that baran has to deliver these artefacts to the assassin in order to get paid therefore you and i should continue our masquerade
agreed but captain i cannot allow the resonator to be assembled if necessary i will destroy this ship its crew all of us to prevent that from happening
acting captains log stardate  the enterprise is entering the hyralan sector which i believe to be the next destination of the mercenary ship

im picking up a small vessel bearing one two seven mark three three five
is it the mercenary ship
no sir its a klingon ship
a toron class shuttlecraft one person
open a channel this is lieutenant commander data of the federation starship enterprise
koral
i take it that is your name may i inquire as to your destination
no
may i ask the purpose of your journey
no
perhaps i have not made our intentions clear we are investigating

he seems most uncooperative
he may have been curt but he was also very worried and even a little scared
sir may i recommend that we bring the shuttle aboard with our tractor beam search it and interrogate koral
according to the terms of the klingonfederation treaty koral has every right to free transit through federation space we cannot board or search his vessel without cause
yes sir however the treaty does give us the right to conduct health and safety inspections of any ship in our space
health and safety inspections
i am not sure that using this clause as an excuse to conduct a search would be consistent with the spirit of the treaty
yes sir
however if koral wishes to contest our actions he can file a protest with the judge advocate generals office bring the shuttle aboard then you and doctor crusher can begin the inspection
aye sir


hello im doctor crusher and this is lieutenant worf were here to conduct a health and safety inspection of your ship
health and safety inspection
thats right you know radiation leaks biochemical contamination other health hazards excuse me

well no radiation so far im sure youre glad to hear that right

theres an incoming message its from the klingon shuttle it was sent approximately fifteen minutes ago hes at the rendezvous coordinates but hes been detained by the enterprise thats all there is hes stopped transmitting
the enterprise
how could they have found out about the rendezvous commander
quiet all that matters now is that the enterprise has the second artefact in their possession we dont have a choice well have to board the enterprise and take the artefact
do you have any idea how many security officers there are on board a ship like that
no i dont but he does
i could get us on the enterprise i can find the artefact
oh yes very convenient we beam you back aboard your old ship and we have to take a risk that you wont change your mind and betray us
i have saved your life twice already galen i would think youd begin to show some gratitude by now
galen if youre so worried about riker then you can go on the raiding party and watch him
agreed
draw weapons and equipment for a raiding party of five

if youre thinking of betraying us to your friends on the enterprise you might remember that i still have the ability to kill you at the first sign of trouble
i havent forgotten
i have an additional task for you one that will prove your loyalty this raid is an opportunity to get rid of galen once youve found that artefact kill him

im sure the health and safety inspection wont last much longer and in the meantime im really glad that we have this opportunity to get to know you may i ask what business youre in

lieutenant worf has programmed our replicators to make a very good approximation of klingon bloodwine i believe you will find it to your liking


well thats my third scan and i still havent find anything out of the ordinary
he must be hiding something we should download his computer memory and analyse it
id have a hard time defending that as part of a safety inspection
we could claim that the computer was generating abnormal radiation signatures
worf were on pretty shaky ground as it is we cant just

dont
watch that door
what is going on
shut your mouth klingon
i guess youre surprised to see me doctor
you could say that
ive had a change of profession
its not in here hey you wheres the artefact
i do not know what youre talking about
use your brain they wouldnt be searching the shuttle if they had the artefact koral must have it where is that klingon pilot
in the observation lounge with data and troi
how far
twelve decks away
security will not allow you to get that far
they wont get the chance well use the transporter in that shuttle well beam directly to the observation lounge sorry about this

lets go

if you could tell us something about the nature of your mission

what is this
quiet  does he have it

this is it
are you sure galen
yes i can recognise the inscription pattern from the first artefact
commander riker by taking this action you risk charges of assault theft piracy and treason
really then i guess adding one more charge wouldnt hurt

is he dead
yes
good activate the transporter

security alert medical emergency team to the observation lounge data to bridge raise shields and begin sensor sweeps for the mercenary ship
aye sir
hes all right hes only stunned
i must admit i am experiencing a similar sensation
this is going to take a little time to explain

set course three one zero mark two one five warp six

where is it

i have something else for you baran

tell him what happened narik
riker turned on us he tried to kill galen before we beamed back
he might have killed all of us and i believe he was acting under direct orders baran you betrayed us this has gone far enough i think it is time that we had a new commander someone who will lead us to those profits that weve been promised
oh really and who would that be galen you hes plotted this all along opposed me at every turn endangered all of us by refusing to follow his orders
follow your orders the orders of a small man trying to fill a role too big for him i say its time for a change whos with me

its over baran
not quite as long as i have this im still captain of this ship
you cant kill all of us you need us to run the ship more than we need you to command it
i dont have to kill you all just you galen

what happened
i switched the transponder codes given his feelings about me it seemed a sensible thing to do
baran was nothing we have a mission to complete and the crew needs a leader

therell be no more punishment on this ship now do your duties and ill see to it that we complete our mission and get our payment
remove that
orders
maintain our present course and speed for now im going to find out when and where were supposed to deliver our cargo
aye captain

worf to commander riker minister satok of vulcan security is standing by on a secure channel
put it through in here
greetings commander how may i be of service
minister i thought i should let you know that the mercenary ship which has been raiding planets in the taugan sector is probably on its way to vulcan right now
i do not understand
im sorry its been a difficult couple of days i know that one of your operatives has been on a mercenary ship investigating the possible reassembly of a psionic resonator i didnt want someone to make a mistake and start firing at them when they approach your planet
commander i believe there is a problem we have no operative aboard a mercenary ship

according to barans logs we are to deliver the two pieces to the tkarath sanctuary on vulcan
i know that place it was an underground stronghold for one of the factions during the last civil war its been abandoned for centuries
galen to bridge alter course for vulcan
understood
oh i wonder if you can possibly help me with something i have been able to translate most of the writing on these two pieces for the most part theyre warnings of death and destruction to anyone who opposes the resonator but i am not able to determine what appears on the anterior side for example this symbol represents the vulcan god of war and this is the god of death but if you look really carefully you can see a third symbol missing now that obviously should belong to the final piece now whats odd about this is that the gods of death and war would typically always stand alone on an artefact they would never be combined with a third glyph
fascinating but i am not an archaeological expert
im really anxious to see the final artefact because it might provide a valuable insight into vulcan mythology
when we arrive at vulcan i will take these pieces to a secure holding area before going on to the sanctuary i prefer to go alone it will arouse less suspicion on the part of the isolationists
well there should be no problem about our entering orbit i asked commander riker to contact the vulcan authorities from the enterprise and let them know that we were approaching
why did you do that
well i didnt want to risk a misunderstanding someone might have mistaken this for an actual raid
it was a wise precaution
perhaps i should contact the enterprise have them meet us at vulcan just in case these isolationists try to escape
your offer is appreciated but our security forces are more than adequate
i see do you think its wise for you to go there alone after all they were expecting baran to show up dont you think if i were to accompany you it might seem more plausible
captain i do understand your human emotional need to be there at the final moment but this is a vulcan matter
of course
thank you

we have entered orbit of vulcan
tallera ive decided on a change of plan take one of the artefacts with you leave the other here as soon as we have our payment in full well complete the delivery
that was not the agreement
i realise that but its safer for all concerned to leave one behind
they will not pay us until they get both pieces
theyve been waiting a long time for this theyre not going to take any risks now take one of the artefacts and beam down
that is all i was waiting for go to the navigational computer and check file one three seven slash omega youll find a message secretly transmitted to the enterprise containing our entire flight plan
shes right
the message was sent by galen hes a starfleet officer
tallera is right but what shes not telling you is that those artefacts shes holding are part of an incredibly powerful weapon theres no reward waiting for you down on the surface as soon as shes got those artefacts shell leave you behind to be captured by starfleet
i dont care what it is you want tallera i dont care if thats a weapon for your personal use or if youre really just making a delivery as planned all i care about is my money so i propose a compromise narik and i will go with you to the surface to guarantee that we receive our payment
after that you can go anywhere you want
agreed bring him as well well use him as a hostage if starfleet arrives if not well kill him on the surface


there your reward as promised
is it all there
no this is less than half of what we were promised wheres the rest of it

that is all i could manage i suggest you take it and leave
i did not come this far to be cheated i want it all now
very well you will get what you deserve

go ahead captain pick up the phaser see what good it will do
youll never get away with this starfleet will never stand and watch you tear apart one of the founding worlds of the federation
how little you understand what youre facing captain youre used to fighting enemies like yourself people on ships with defence shields energy weapons warp drives but this is unlike anything youve ever faced this is the power of the mind pick up the phaser captain

listen to me all of you drop your weapons do it dont make any aggressive movements the resonator amplifies violent feelings and emotions and thats why you wanted me to pick up the phaser thats how you were able to kill narik and vekor but i can see the symbol on that third artefact and it is the vulcan symbol for peace standing between the symbols for war and death its a warning that the power of the resonator can be overcome by peace
you are about to see how wrong you are
empty your minds of violent thoughts

no
think tallera two thousand years ago your people were being consumed by war but when peace came to vulcan the resonator became useless thats why it was dismantled

you were right tallera the resonator cannot be stopped by phasers and shields but it can be defeated by peace

captains log stardate  security minister satok has taken tallera into custody and begun a search for the rest of the isolationists

once we realised that you were no longer on the mercenary ship we scanned the surface for your neural implant we tracked the signal into the caverns
what will become of the resonator sir
satok has assured me that all three pieces will be destroyed
it is unfortunate it cannot be studied the resonator is a key artefact from a remarkable period of history
normally i would be the first one to agree but perhaps some things best left in the past
whats going to happen to the mercenaries
oh they will be detained by the vulcan authorities for the moment but theyre also facing charges from the klingons the cardassians  the ferengi and at least seven other worlds i dont think well be hearing from them for a while number one will you set course for starbase two twenty seven ill join you on the bridge shortly
wait a minute youve been declared dead you cant give orders around here
if we are to adhere to the exact letter of starfleet regulations then technically sir you have been declared a renegade in fact i believe you are facing twelve counts of court martial offences you cannot give orders either sir
thats quite right and as im supposed to be dead ill go and get some sleep and mister data i suggest that you escort commander riker to the brig
aye sir

 this way sir
data he was joking you know that right data
phantasms



data there you are we need to install that plasma conduit right away were bringing the new warp core on line in less than three hours
i will go to deck twenty and begin modifications
great ill meet you in engineering as soon as youre finished there this ought to be a lot of fun

excuse me do you have authorisation to work in this area you are dismantling a warp plasma conduit i must ask you to stop

be quiet



captains log stardate  commander la forge has completed the installation of our new warp core we are preparing to test its capabilities


something wrong sir
i just got a message from starfleet command
bad news
you could say that ive been invited to the annual starfleet admirals banquet
my condolences
ive managed to avoid it for the past six years but now it would seem my luck has run out i cant think of anything more tedious fifty admirals shaking hands making dull conversation uninteresting food boring speeches
cant you think of some excuse to get out of it
after six years number one i dont think i have any excuses left

geordi have you ever had a nightmare
yeah sure data everybody does from time to time
i have had one hundred eleven dreams since i first discovered this programme nine months ago in all of that time i have never experienced such strange and disturbing imagery i believe it was a nightmare
nightmares are part of dreaming data maybe youve just discovered another new level to your programme
perhaps i have also noted that i am spending an inordinate amount of time thinking about nightmare imagery one could almost say i am preoccupied
well its perfectly normal data sometimes when i have a nightmare i cant shake that weird feeling for a couple of days
commander la forge
speaking of nightmares
 i just finished recalibrating the starboard eps module
thats great ensign thank you
its just like you said reset the power tap and the module came right online you have such a wonderful grasp of engineering principles im learning so much just by being around you
ill tell you what why dont you help farrell check the deuterium cartridges im just about to bring the warp core online all right
anything you say

geordi you do not seem to appreciate ensign tylers enthusiasm
shes enthusiastic all right about me
i do not understand
shes got a crush on me data
you do not share her affection
exactly and quite frankly its beginning to get a little bit uncomfortable
i believe i understand you are concerned about unintentionally hurting ensign tylers feelings
yeah something like that
it would appear that you require a third party to intervene on your behalf i will be happy to speak to her
no data ill take care of it myself thanks
geordi when i first awoke from my nightmare there was a brief moment when i
bridge to commander la forge whats our status
were ready to bring the new core online captain stand by all right lets do it initializing deuterium infusion sequence its a thing of beauty isnt it now lets see how fast she can run la forge to bridge

warp power at your discretion captain
acknowledged ensign gates set course for starbase two nineteen warp six engage

engage bridge to engineering mister la forge why isnt my ship

moving
im on it sir theres a warp plasma conduit out of alignment but i think ive got it fixed now ready sir

very well ensign gates

mister la forge

stand by captain
captain i am taking the warpcoil engines offline

la forge to bridge im sorry sir but were going to have to reconfigure this plasma conduit its going to take at least a couple of hours sir

hello data
counsellor
what are you doing
i have been watching spot sleep in the past fifteen minutes he has had twelve muscles spasms which indicates he was dreaming i have often wondered what spot dreams about his twitching and his rapid breathing would seem to suggest anxiety but spot has never seen a mouse or any other form of rodentia he has never encountered an insect or been chased by a canine
i understand youve had some interesting dreams recently geordi was worried about you and he wanted me to check in and see how you were doing
that was very thoughtful of him ive been debating whether or not to initiate another dream sequence
because of the nightmares
i have found them to be quite unsettling
data you shouldnt be afraid of dark imagery in your dreams its a natural expression of your unconscious if you have an unconscious im not really sure how your positronic brain works but if its anything like ours then theres part of you thats trying to express itself through your dream state and i think you should allow yourself to experience it as sigmund freud said dreams are the royal road to the knowledge of the mind
thank you counsellor i believe i will initiate a dream programme now
let me know how it goes goodnight data
goodnight counsellor goodnight spot

computer dim lights


mmm delicious
what kind of cake are you eating
it is cellular peptide cake with mint frosting would you like a bite

no thank you excuse me mister worf

arent you going to answer that mister data
sir
that damn ringing answer it will you
yes sir

please identify yourselves i must know what you are trying to 
be quiet

please dont hurt me data
i am sorry counsellor
no dont no no data


data data

what is wrong
weve been trying to wake you up for the last five minutes
when you didnt show up on time in engineering i got worried
my internal chronometer was supposed to wake me thirty five minutes ago
you must have overslept
that is not possible something is wrong

i cant find anything wrong with your internal time base as far as i can tell your primary systems check out fine
i will compare my autonomic logs with the ships chronometer perhaps we have overlooked something
you know data theres an awful lot we dont know about your dream programme maybe it was designed to cause side effects i mean for all we know doctor soong might have intended for you to oversleep from time to time its part of the human experience
it is a possibility however i would prefer to make certain there are no anomalies in my neural net
you know im curious what were you dreaming about when we woke you up
i have not fully assimilated its impact i would prefer to study the images further before discussing them
sounds like it must have been pretty strange
strange is not a sufficient adjective to describe the experience

tell me more about this cake
it is difficult to explain counsellor trois body was a cake
her upper body describe the knife you used to cut the counsellor
it had a black handle and a serrated blade and it was quite long
how long
twenty five centimetres in length
and what happened next
one of the workmen pointed to her right shoulder at that moment i had an overwhelming urge to cut a piece out of the cake
and did you
yes as i began slicing the cake she reacted as though i was causing her pain yet i could not stop cutting that is when i woke up doctor freud i am curious

i am curious what do my nightmares mean
i believe you are experiencing a classic dismemberment dream or in your case being a mechanical man a dismantlement dream
i do not understand
your mechanistic qualities are trying to reassert themselves over your human tendencies ego and id struggling for domination the workmen symbolise the ever present id constantly working to destroy the ego now the image of counsellor troi a female is devoured by you clearly indicating an unconscious desire to possess your own mother
but i do not have a mother
do not interrupt the knife in its violent connotation suggests a certain feeling of sexual inadequacy
but i have no sexual desire
ach impotence on top of everything it is all becoming clear to me now there might be a paper in this
i do not believe i am being helped by this session
classic transference your anger toward me is in fact the animosity you feel toward your father you are a polymorphously perverse individual mister data and i recommend full psychoanalysis i believe i can fit you in next tuesday
that will not be necessary computer end programme

captain incoming message from admiral nakamura
on screen
admiral
captain we were expecting you this morning is there a problem
actually we have been experiencing a few minor difficulties with our new warp core but my chief engineer assures me that we will be under way within the hour
youre not trying to avoid this particular engagement are you picard
no no certainly not im really looking forward to it
good ill expect you soon nakamura out
i think hes on to you sir
la forge to bridge
go ahead geordi

weve just started it up captain all systems are holding steady

ready when you are sir
ensign gates set a course and engage


engineering report
the warp field has collapsed sir
it looks like weve blown the entire power converter captain impulse engines are down too were not going anywhere but i know just how to fix this give me two three hours tops
now what

talk about going nowhere fast
mister worf open a channel to starbase two nineteen advise admiral nakamura ill be a little later than i thought
aye sir


tyler howre you coming with that relay diagnostic
almost done sir excuse me i need the plasma inverter

it appears ensign tyler still has a crush on you it is clear you did not speak to her
no data i havent had the time listen i want you to take this brace coil and run a metallurgical scan on it for me see if there are any microfractures

something wrong data
i am reminded of a recent dream this brace is reminiscent of

are you going to answer that commander

what are you waiting for answer it

hello
kill them you must kill them all before its too late
data data whats wrong
i do not know


everything seems to remind me of the nightmare objects sounds smells and now i have seen elements of the dream in a waking state i cannot explain it
data if you were one of my human patients i might be concerned right now id say you had a waking dream or an hallucination but youre not human i think we might be looking at some kind of technological problem
i have run three complete self diagnostics all of my systems are functioning normally perhaps doctor freud was correct the knife i dreamed about is the embodiment of my unconscious desire to inflict violence
data even freud said sometimes a cigar is just a cigar but the bottom line is i think youre developing an almost obsessive interest in your own inner workings id almost call it the beginnings of a neurosis
that is not possible
why not youve eliminated all the technical explanations and it makes sense that as your neural net becomes more complex more human that you might experience the same kind of psychological complexities as a human
do you really think it is possible
data you must be the first person whos come into my office and been excited at the prospect of a new neurosis but yes i do think its possible and id like to start counselling you on a regular basis
daily
no well start weekly and as a first step id like you to shut down your dream programme until our next session just to be on the safe side give yourself a chance to reflect on this experience
thank you counsellor i look forward to our next meeting
and data next time see me before you see sigmund

admiral i can explain
let me guess your new warp core is malfunctioning again
unfortunately the problem has affected our impulse systems at the moment we are adrift
are you expecting to have this problem fixed soon or shall we send out a tow ship to bring you in
that will not be necessary i have full confidence in my engineering staff i will be at the banquet on time picard out

have you tried reconfiguring the plasma conduits
yes captain two hours ago
what about the relays are you absolutely certain you dont need a new phase invertor
i am currently running a level three diagnostic of the relays sir we will have the results of the analysis in approximately ten minutes
i see oh perhaps i could reconfigure these isolinear chips
no sir please dont touch that captain commander data and i have the situation under control now if youd just let us care of it the work would go much faster
captain we could use an extra hand moving the containment pods if it wouldnt be an imposition
oh no not at all id be delighted

good work tyler i thought hed never leave data i want you to give me a hand locking down this plasma conduit data data



deck thirty six

hello data are you all right

what are you doing
hold very still counsellor
no


ever since you gave alexander that music programme hes been playing it all night every night
i just wanted to broaden his horizons besides he likes it
it is screeching pounding dissonance it is not music
worf its better than music its jazz

medical emergency deck seventeen section three alpha
were on our way

i believe i had another waking dream sir but this time i had an uncontrollable urge to eliminate the image i saw
and what you saw was some sort of a mouth on trois shoulder
yes sir for a reason i cannot explain i had the need to destroy it
what about me did you see one of those mouths on my head as well
no sir i saw a straw coming out of your head
a straw
as i said before these are all images i originally experienced in my dream programme i do not have a rational explanation for them
mister la forge
captain weve run every possible diagnostic on datas positronic net we can think of we cant find anything wrong i could run a subpolymer scan but it would take some time to set up the equipment
make it so in the meantime mister data ill have to relieve you of duty and confine you to your quarters
a sensible precaution sir

 data
deanna youre in sickbay its all right
data
hes not here just try to relax this vascular pad has healed the wound but youve lost a lot of blood so i would like you to lie still for a while

thats odd there shouldnt be any discoloration after the treatment this looks like some sort of rash
what is it
im picking up cellular degradation but it doesnt appear to be related to the lacerations theres also some kind of residual interphasic signature nurse bring me an interphasic scanner i want to take a closer look at this

commander i will have to confiscate your sidearm
of course  may i ask a personal favour
yes
will you take care of spot for me
your animal
i am afraid if i have another waking dream i might injure him
of course spot come here
unlike a canine spot does not respond to verbal commands  goodbye spot he will need to be fed once a day he prefers feline supplement number twenty five
i understand
and he will require water and you must provide him with a sand box and you must talk to him tell him he is a pretty cat and a good cat
i will feed him
perhaps that will be enough


captain we have a problem take a look at this her tissue is breaking down on a cellular level and its spreading at first i thought it was a rash from the coil brace she was stabbed with but when i used the interphasic scanner i found this

what is it
the question is what are they

ive tested all the medical staff and ive found them on almost everyone so far the cellular decay is accelerating in all cases i havent found a way to stop it or even slow it down  looks like youre infected too the organisms appear to be attached to our epidermal layers with osmotic tendrils theyre tapping directly into the bloodstream  and from what i can tell theyre spreading

what are we dealing with here are these creatures feeding on us
yes in a very particular way they appear to be extracting our cellular peptides its roughly analogous to the way terran leeches consume haemoglobin if theyre not removed soon our bodies are going to lose all their cellular cohesion well collapse into nothing but a few pounds of chemicals
all right is there any way that we can affect these organisms
weve tried em radiation subspace fields thermal protons nothings worked they seem to exist in some sort of interphasic state just beyond our range of visual and sensor acuity the only way we can see them is to use an ip scanner tricorders cant even pick them up
do we know where these things came from mister worf
i scanned the vicinity with an ip scanner there is no sign of any similar creatures or any unusual interphasic activity
what about mister data there must be some connection between his odd behaviour and these creatures is he infested as well
no i scanned him but i found nothing
data attacked counsellor troi because he saw a mouth on her shoulder and in that same area that we first saw one of the organisms
data also saw a straw in my head and then beverly discovered an organism in the same place
those images are all part of datas dream maybe somehow hes unconsciously perceiving these creatures
then perhaps it is time that we took a closer look at mister datas dreams

it is an interesting hypothesis if i am being affected by these interphasic creatures on an unconscious level it may also explain my waking dreams and my subsequent antisocial behaviour
what we want to do data is link your neural net into the holodeck and have you activate your dream programme so as you dream we can observe the dream images
perhaps we can learn more about these creatures by interpreting the symbols and images of your dreams
i see the concept is similar to the method of directed dreaming
exactly how soon can you have the link ready
wed need about an hour to establish all the interface parameters
make it so in the meantime mister data i suggest that you should prepare for bed


i think were ready captain the link is active the holodeck has been calibrated to datas neural net

ready mister data
yes sir
normally i would wish you pleasant dreams but in this case bad dreams would be more helpful
i understand sir initiating dream programme stand by

lets be very observant even the most insignificant image could be a very important symbol
right

here he comes
hello
can we speak to data directly or would that wake him up
he should be perceiving us as just another part of his dream anything we say to him will be taken in that context
you know that sounds like a telephone ringer but i dont see a receiver


cake
oh er thank you look at that her right shoulder that is the same place that data stabbed her
in his waking dream he said that there was a mouth on her shoulder
theyre both symbols of consumption mouth food mister data what kind of cake is this
it is cellular peptide cake
with mint frosting
cellular peptides thats exactly what the creatures are extracting
will someone answer that damn ringing captain the ringing is getting worse
what could the ringing symbolise a bell sound an oldfashioned way of communicating
do you want some its delicious
will somebody please get that

yes its for you
picard
kill them
kill who
kill them before it is too late
who is this

i am doctor sigmund freud
how does he fit into all this
if i were to interpret my own appearance in this dream i would say i am the symbolic representation of datas unconscious mind trying to warn him about the dangers he perceives around him
you mean the interphasic organisms
of course
tell me doctor how do we kill them

answer it nien nien nien do not be so literal when i say answer it i mean respond to it to them

be quiet

what do they represent
i dont know but i do recognise that junction theyre working on its the plasma conduit we installed with the new warp core
respond respond to them what does that mean
what is it that youre doing
go away leave us alone
who are you
we are your enemies
stop you must not hurt my friends

be quiet
data the shrieking noise you made it causes them pain

be quiet

i believe i understand

geordi
yes data
you must adjust my positronic subprocessor to emit an interphasic pulse
data whats going on
the workmen in my dreams represent the organisms which are trying to demolish the ship the incessant ringing of the telephone freuds cautions at the other end were warnings of the dangers around us
what about the shrieking noises that you made
my positronic subprocessor detected high frequency interphasic signatures from the organisms which were symbolically represented in my dreams by a high shriek
when you made those noises the workmen reacted in pain
that is why i have asked geordi to adjust my subprocessor if i can produce a high frequency interphasic pulse it may have a similar effect on the creatures
were ready
picard to sickbay beverly were going to be sweeping the ship with a high frequency ip pulse will you monitor the creatures for any response
understood



its working captain

captains log supplemental the creatures infesting the enterprise have been completely eliminated we believe the infestation originated within the warp core we obtained on starbase eighty four

this conduit was manufactured on thanatos seven using a new interphasic fusion process we think it was that process which attracted the organisms to the conduit where they lay dormant until we activated the warp core thats also why we couldnt get the core online the creatures were disrupting the plasma flow
how long before we have warp power again
well were going to have to manufacture a new conduit thats at least six hours work
six hour the banquet will be completely over by then thats very unfortunate
i can try and speed things up a bit
no no no i wouldnt want to sacrifice the safety of the ship
understood sir


enter

counsellor i did not have a chance to apologise for my actions
data dont worry about it geordi explained everything to me it wasnt your fault but somehow i thought turnabout would be fair play so i made us a little something to snack on

i wonder what would doctor freud say about the symbolism of devouring oneself
data sometimes a cake is just a cake
dark page

captains log stardate  a delegation of the cairn have just come on board this telepathic species has no concept of spoken language and is being instructed in its use by an old friend

 i dont know what theyd have done without me first i had to learn how they communicate it was an absolutely exhausting process
it must have been
quite different from betazed telepathy we transmit words with the cairn its images a flood of them all at the same time its overwhelming
i can imagine
actually its a very efficient way of communicating if two cairn were having this conversation it would have been over minutes ago
really
of course they realise that theyll want to communicate verbally if they join the federation do me a favour introduce yourself to one of them engage him in conversation they need the practice
id be happy to
its called a visor it enables me to see
 like my vocal enhancer it helps me make sounds
i see youve already met my star pupil hedrils picked up spoken language much faster than the others
it is often the case that children learn languages more easily than adults
deanna was quite good at languages when she was little where is deanna
well she must be here somewhere
hedril darling

what
go find your father dear i want to talk to him
mrs troi
yes yes just a little tired this constant telepathy with the cairn im fine really arent you going to mingle mister woof
i do not care for telepaths they make me uneasy
dont worry the cairn couldnt read your thoughts even if they wanted to your brain isnt sophisticated enough  neither is yours dear they can only communicate with other telepaths have either of you seen deanna
she was working but she said she would be  speak of the devil
sorry im late i lost track of the time
deanna dear come with me i want you to meet the senior diplomat of the cairn delegation maques this is the beautiful daughter ive been telling you about deanna
pleased to hello
hello pleased to meet you
oh yes that is it pleased to meet you deanna
good well ill just let you young people chat

well maques what do you think of the enterprise
it is beautiful comfortable also
im glad you think so
there is another word that describes it but i cannot remember
youve learned a great deal in a very short time im sure it wont be long before your words do justice to your thoughts
your mother told me of your need
need
a moment husband you need a husband i need a wife

deanna good morning so what did you think of maques
why did you do that mother you embarrassed both of us
hes really very sweet and lonely poor man a widower raising a child alone
mother dont start
i just think its time for you to settle down if your father were still alive im sure hed say the same thing


deck eight
but youll do exactly what you want just like always
mother stop it

are you coming


whats wrong
you are so precious to me youre all ive got if something happened to you i dont know what id do
nothings going to happen to me
youd better go
my first appointment isnt for a few minutes why dont we talk for a while
no im fine im just tired from working with the cairn its making me emotional
are you sure
go on ill see you later go on

maques
i must to apologise for yesterday
you dont have to
my words they were confused
it wasnt your fault please  my mother misled you
not in everything she has an image of you in her mind she shared it with me you are even more beautiful the way my people communicate it is direct nothing is hidden
yes
your mother is the first to learn our telepathy
you mean youve never had telepathy with someone who wasnt cairn
no to communicate with her is very different
in what way
always there is a part of her that um a part of her that is dark
dark
a part of her that can not be seen do you understand
im not sure have you ask my mother about this
she called it a moment privacy
of course you said among the cairn nothing is hidden we value honesty but we dont always share everything were thinking and feeling
this is privacy
yes
it is normal
for us yes
if this is your way i am relieved
it is our way
i will leave now
im glad you stopped by
i am glad to have stopped also

i was all set for another round of arguing when all of a sudden she just fell apart
shes under a lot of stress shes preparing the cairn to meet with the federation council
its more than that im been sensing very erratic emotions from her even the clothes shes wearing are unusual theyre so subdued
maybe you just need to sit and talk with her

commander take your hands off her
mrs troi
dont you mrs troi me
mother
why dont you leave her alone if it werent for you shed be married by now
thats enough
now i am warning you stay away from my daughter
youre coming with me

i dont know what got into me please tell will how sorry i am
youre fine but your psilosynine levels are a little low
psilowhat
its a neurotransmitter involved in telepathy
its been depleted by your work with the cairn youre going to have to try to avoid telepathic communication for a while
i cant
why
we only have three days left and the cairn have so much to learn
lwaxana im sorry but youre going to have to take some time and rest
maybe i can help with the cairn
no youre only half betazoid dear and you have no experience with their form of telepathy
then i wont use telepathy well work verbally
i suppose we could do that and if they dont understand something ill explain it to them telepathically
no youll work verbally too the point is for you to get some rest mother besides itll do them good to have to figure things out with words
i suppose youre right


this is the ships arboretum
arbor means tree
very good hedril this is where people come to relax enjoy themselves in a natural setting

flowers of all hue and without thorn the rose its an old earth poem by john milton
please what is a poem
poetry is an art form that uses words put together in new and unexpected ways sometimes in rhyme milton was speculating that in heaven roses wouldnt have thorns
heaven
oh er heaven is well its how can i put it

yes i see thank you heaven
mother youre supposed to be avoiding telepathy
im only trying to help dear
you dont look well
im just tired maybe ill sit down

dont worry shell be fine this is something i think youll find interesting its a jewel plant from folnar three the plant secretes a resin which is collected within the blossom by the time the bloom has faded the resin has hardened into a rare and beautiful gem

mother

mother troi to sickbay medical emergency in the arboretum

shes not responding to cortical stimulation im not sure what else i can do
i dont understand she was fine just yesterday
its so strange its almost as if her brain has shut itself down
is there a physiological cause
im running a subneural scan as far as i can see theres no tissue damage no neurochemical imbalance no sign of infection nothing
yet her neural activity is practically nonexistent
the only exception is in the paracortex activity there is almost off the scale
the paracortex is the betazoid telepathic lobe she communicated with maques telepathically just before she fell
might there be some side effect of cairn telepathy of which were unaware
its a possibility
i think its time that you and i had a talk with maques

i am very apologetic for what has happened to your mother
maques is it possible that your telepathic communications with mrs troi harmed her in some way
no i tried to explain before bad thoughts they hurt her
what thoughts take your time
inside her the dark place
i dont understand
she is what are the words i dont have the words

counsellor stop it
its all right im fine he was just trying to communicate with me telepathically
do you understand now
im not sure

he communicated so much to me that at first it was just a jumble of images
have you been able to sort any of it out
i think so during his telepathic contact with my mother maques sensed what he calls a dark place he tried to tell me about it before in my office and i misunderstood i thought he was talking about thoughts my mother was keeping private but what he meant was that there was something happening in her met conscious mind
metaconscious
its a part of the betazoid psyche its a kind of filtering mechanism that protects us from psychic trauma
is maques suggesting that your mothers metaconscious has been somehow damaged
he feels that whatever is wrong with her is centred there if hes right it may mean that shes suffered some kind of trauma that her metaconscious just cant tolerate
has your mother mentioned anything that happened to her lately something that might have been traumatic for her
no nothing
maques could be wrong about this theres still a chance that a subneural scan might be able to pinpoint an physiological cause for your mothers condition something that i might be able to treat the results wont be in until morning maybe we should all try and get some rest
id like to stay here with her im going to try to contact her telepathically
all right

mother can you hear me please come back to me please
help me
mother
help me
how how can i help you
tell me mother please

computer lights

what are you doing

maques what were you doing in sickbay
helping trying to help lwaxana
how what were you trying to do
i was she was you deanna maybe you
yes
you must how can i explain
tell me telepathically

maques believes my mothers psyche has collapsed in on itself that for some reason she has retreated into her metaconscious mind
was he trying to contact her telepathically
yes he was able to access images being generated by her metaconscious but he couldnt make any sense of them
i did not understand
he saw faces he didnt recognize events he couldnt interpret
if we could decipher these images we might be able to determine whether or not your mothers condition was induced by a traumatic event
maques feels he can provide a telepathic bridge that will allow me to access my mothers metaconscious if he can i might be able to find out what happened to her
and if you succeed can you use that information to help your mother
im not sure but i do know that theres a part of her that wants to be helped when i tried to contact her telepathically i heard a voice calling out to me
if her psyche has collapsed in on itself could accessing her mind pose any danger to you
theres no way to know id like to try

ill be monitoring her throughout the entire procedure if anything goes wrong maques can break the telepathic link
your mother part of her is very frightened she may resist you
i understand

help me
mother
help me

counsellor can you hear me
captain
deanna doctor crushers become concerned that your paracortical readings have become erratic
are you talking to me from sickbay
yes i want you to sever your connection to your mother
why dont you ask maques to do it
im asking you that is an order counsellor
youre not captain picard
 leave me alone please

this isnt real none of this is real



deanna
daddy
look at you youve become a beautiful woman
dont do this
im sorry i had to go away when you were so little i didnt want to
youre not my father youre part of my mothers mind what is this place
this is our house near lake elnar on betazed we used to live here deanna lets not waste this chance i want to hear everything about you
did i live here
for a while when you were a baby you were such a beautiful baby your mother and i loved you so much
i dont remember these toys
i bet you dont remember me singing you to sleep at night either but i did
i do remember i always felt safe when you sang to me
there was one song you always asked me to sing you couldnt fall asleep unless you heard it
down in the valley
yes  down in the valley valley so low hang your head over hear the wind blow
no youre just trying to keep me here keep me from finding something
your mother doesnt want to see you deanna
i have to help her
if you want to help her leave let her have peace
she called out to me she does want me to help
stay with me just a little while deanna its been so long well never have this chance again
goodbye daddy


hedril

mother
get away from her

no

hedril i asked your father to bring you here because i wanted to talk to you about something you know that lwaxanas sick dont you
yes is it my fault
no not at all but i believe that shes been thinking about you do you know why
i make her sad
why do you say that
because its true
do you have any idea why hedril would make my mother sad
no
well thank you for coming to talk to us ill see you later all right
counsellor i hope your mother gets better
thank you hedril so do i

i just dont understand how she fits in to all this
and i havent found a physiological cause for whats happened to your mother which makes me feel that maques was right when he said that your mothers condition was precipitated by a traumatic event
could this event have involved hedril
i dont think so my mother never mentioned her
does your mother keep personal logs or a journal
yes she does ill contact mister homn on betazed and ask him to transmit a copy as soon as possible there may be some clues there
perhaps we are being too literal i have recently learned in my study of dream analysis that people who appear in a dream can sometimes represent different aspects of the person who is dreaming
thats right a child might represent vulnerability hedril may depict some fragile part of my mother
a part that shes protecting you said that everything you encountered when you were in her mind was a barrier of one kind or another
yes you the wolf my father it was though she were summoning all her defences to keep me away but keep me away from what what is she protecting


come in
counsellor
hello captain
ive just come from sickbay doctor crusher feels that your mothers condition is worsening her neural foundations are getting weaker have you had any luck here
no nothing ive gone through all her belongings read her journal from the last five years and other than the fact that im not married yet nothing bad seems to have happened to her
is this your father
yes
he had a kind face
i remember when he died my mother had to go through all his things and pack them away i was seven i remember thinking how mad hed be when he came home and saw what shed done i didnt understand he wasnt coming back
deanna your mother might still come out of this
if we cant figure out whats wrong with her captain i dont think she will but i dont know what else to do ive talked with mister homn whos known her for years ive checked her medical records ive made enquiries to the government on betazed ive contacted her closest friends if shes been through some kind of psychic trauma theres just no evidence of it
you said youd reviewed her journals for the past five years maybe we should go further back
thats a lot to review my mothers kept a journal since before she was married
then lets start at the beginning the first entry seems to be stardate 
thats the year they were married
thats odd theres a seven year gap
it starts about a year after the wedding
and if im not mistaken it ends a few months after your birth
my mothers so diligent about her journal why would she have stopped making entries for so long
she didnt the files were deleted by your mother almost thirty years ago
i dont understand any of this captain i have to go back inside my mothers mind its the only way were ever going to get any answers

 thank you deanna you understand that if your paracortical readings go too high again im going to tell maques to sever the connection
i know

hedril be careful

who is hedril
wait i want to talk to you

help me help me



go
mother
go away
no i want to help you why did you delete parts of your journal did something happen to you you dont want me to know about
leave me alone please
whos hedril mother why is she here is hedril me when i was a little girl
no oh no id never let anything happen to you never
did you let something happen to someone was it here at elnar
you were just a baby
tell me whatever it is we can face it together
i cant i cant
you can we can
help me help me papa

please dont make me go through this again
hold on to him dont let him run off

you have to you cant hold it back its killing you
the dog got away she ran after him we didnt notice


why why did i look away why wasnt i paying attention
you have to forgive yourself mother you have to let go
how can i i let her die
it was a terrible tragedy the worst thing that can happen to any parent i know you feel responsible but it was an accident and what youre doing isnt fair to kestra
i saw a little girl who was sweet and happy she must have brought a great deal of joy to your lives
she woke up every morning with a smile
isnt it better to remember her like that i just found out i had a sister i never knew id like to learn what was good and joyous about her to celebrate her life not mourn it
how how can i do that
kestra was here a few moments ago talk to her
no no
do it mother tell her how you feel ill be here with you ill help you
mommy
kestra oh kestra my precious one im so sorry

i remember the day i took this
mister homn said he saved it in case someday you wanted to remember her
i wish you could have known her deanna i wish you two could have grown up together
tell me about her i want to know everything
attached

captains log stardate  the enterprise has arrived at kesprytt three in order to evaluate an unusual request on the part of the kes for associate membership in the federation


this morning she was fifteen minutes late thats the third time this week jeanluc you dont have the slightest idea what im talking about do you
no im really sorry i dont
ive been telling you about nurse ogawa and ensign markson for the last fifteen minutes
you have im really sorry
are you worried about this mission with the kes
not worried exactly this notion of admitting half of their planet to the federation while leaving the other half out
first of all the kes are not half the planet theyre nearly three quarters of it and the prytt are not being left out they themselves simply dont want to have contact with anyone from the outside not the federation or anyone else
every member of the federation entered as a unified world and that unity said something about them that they had resolved certain social and political differences and they were now ready to become part a larger community
by all indications the kes are a very unified very progressive people
but the prytt are not they are reclusive to the point of xenophobia
well think about earth what if one of the old nation states say australia had decided not to join the world government in twenty one fifty would that have disqualified us as a federation member
that analogy is not exactly
riker to captain
go ahead number one

weve received word from ambassador mauric hes ready to see you and doctor crusher

inform him were on our way thank you for breakfast
wait until tomorrow i have something very special planned its a vulcan dish thats all ill say

captain doctor i have the coordinates of ambassador maurics chambers
lets not keep them waiting mister worf
enterprise to kes security relay station one were ready to commence transport
acknowledged enterprise we have lowered our defense shield
confirmed
energise

this is security relay station one we are ready to receive your captain and medical officer
this is the enterprise we have completed the transport sequence you should have them
negative enterprise they are not here


beverly beverly
what happened
i dont know
the last thing i remember we were beginning to transport
i would assume we must be on kesprytt were in some kind of prison cell the question is why i cant imagine that ambassador mauric would have any reason to detain us
jeanluc
what is it
let me see
what

it looks like an implant it seems to be connected directly to the brainstem

some kind of coercive device
whatever it is i doubt its designed for our health

what is going on here
if you tell us why youve taken us hostage we might be able to
 you are not hostages you are prisoners
prisoners on whose authority
you are being held under the authority of the prytt security ministry the charges are conspiring with the enemy
enemy you mean the kes
were not fools we are aware of the federation attempt to establish a military alliance with the kes it will not be tolerated
your information is incorrect we have no plans to enter into any
there is no point in trying to mislead us captain the devices which have been implanted in your cerebral cortexes will soon be calibrated to your psiwave pattern at that time we will be able to get all the information we need
and then youll discover that were telling the truth
we shall see

there is nothing wrong with the transporter i have run a complete diagnostic of all the targeting components
then what happened to the captain and doctor crusher
commander the transporter sensor log shows an unusual concentration of antigraviton particles in the emitter coil
a concentration of antigraviton particles suggests a tractor beam it might have deflected the transporter beam to a different set of coordinates
is there a way to locate those coordinates
the tractor beam originated somewhere in the prytt alliance
why does the prytt want captain picard and doctor crusher
i dont know and its not going to be easy to find out the prytt have consistently refused all outside contact were going to have to work through the kes contact ambassador mauric tell him i want a meeting right now
aye sir


what
what
youre staring at me
i was just thinking about how to get out of here
there may be a structural flaw that would allow us to escape
right
beverly the important thing during any confinement is to think positively and not give up hope there is a way out of every box there is a solution to every puzzle its just a matter of finding it

damn
well at least this means we wont starve to death
it means they plan on keeping us here for a while
im beginning to think negatively jeanluc

my tricorder
does it work
yes except somethings been added to the main directory
its a map
an escape route that guard must be working for the kes
possibly or it could be part of a very carefully laid trap
if you ask me id like to take my chances out there
agreed is there a way to open the cell door
yes the codes been entered


commander on behalf of my government i would like to take this opportunity to present my profound apologies regarding this unfortunate incident
thats very kind ambassador but i dont think anyone here holds you or the kes government responsible for whats happened
our primary concern is not to assign blame but to recover our missing officers
i agree we are prepared to insert a hostage rescue team into the prytt capital city on three hours notice
ambassador we have not even attempted a diplomatic effort yet i would rather not use force until weve exhausted all other options
i dont believe there is any diplomatic option commander we have no formal relations with the prytt no ambassadors theres simply no way to contact them
surely you must have some means of communication in case of a planetary emergency
we have never had need of such a system
we can determine their communications frequencies and establish a link
allow me to be blunt the prytt are a fanatical xenophobic people with little regard for civilised discourse even if you do establish communications link with them it will be a complete waste of time
how long has it been since your last diplomatic contact
almost a century
then its possible they may have changed over the years
we have had other less formal contacts with the prytt contacts we cannot discuss but i can assure you they have changed very little
with all due respect ambassador i think i should try to communicate with the prytt before i sanction the use of force
of course commander in the meantime i will continue making preparations for a rescue attempt
agreed
i do have one request we believe that the prytt obtained their information about the transport of your captain and doctor through a breach in our communications network if i could set up a base of operations here on the enterprise id feel much more secure
mister worf will help you
thank you lieutenant


you first


is there a problem ambassador
probably not simply securing the area
i can assure you there is no need
im sure youre right  yes this will do very nicely
as security chief of the enterprise i would be glad to assist you in any way possible
theres no need well take care of everything thank you lieutenant


there must be a lava flow or a underground hot spring somewhere near here
its a lava flow its about thirty metres below us it says we should go this way i smell gas

this whole chamber is filled with pockets of a methanogenic compound
can we get through it
i think so
what did you say
i didnt say anything there might be a fairly regular pattern to these eruptions we should be able to navigate out way through them if were careful
say when
now


the eruptions have stopped
the gas is building up



i have scanned the entire prytt communications system this appears to be the primary access module for the central government
can you determine which of the comm links is connected to the prime ministers office
i believe so sir however the prytt have no link designed for extraterritorial communication our hail may come as a quite surprise to them
well theyre going to have to adjust open a channel
this is prime minister horaths headquarters how can i be of service
this is commander william t riker federation starship enterprise i know this may seem an unusual way
the enterprise you mean the ship in orbit
thats right
why are you on this comm link
were having trouble contacting your government directly we had to start somewhere if you would let me talk to your
did you get authorisation for this communication from the security ministry
as i said were having trouble contacting you
i cannot participate in an unauthorised communication this transmission is terminated
not very friendly are they
no sir
sir we are being hailed it is the prytt security council
well it looks like we got someones attention on screen
enterprise this is security minister lorin you will immediately cease all attempts at communication with our people
minister weve been attempting to contact someone in your government it appears that you have detained two of our officers we would like to discuss the situation
there is nothing to discuss if you do not terminate these transmissions we will be forced to take aggressive action against your ship

their weapon systems pose no threat to the enterprise
just the same lets keep the shields up for the time being
aye sir
is there a problem commander
our efforts with the prytt just ran into a wall
im sorry but perhaps this will brighten your spirits we have freed your captain and doctor
what
they were being held in prison just outside the prytt capital one of our operatives was able to arrange their escape
where are they now
well they should be en route to the kes border our operative provided them with a detailed map and instructions on where to go
how will you get them across the border
at the moment that information is confidential but trust us we do have a plan
ambassador im afraid i must insist that you provide us with more information
i understand your concern of course but i would feel more comfortable discussing these operational details in a less public environment
certainly we can step into the ready room
i would prefer the quarters you provided me theyre safer
all right

theres no way out of here
maybe we took a wrong turn

so am i
what
im thirsty too
i didnt say anything about being thirsty
i heard you you said im very thirsty
i was thinking about it but i didnt say anything
you were thinking it
the transceivers lorin said that they would align themselves to our psiwave patterns
the implants must be transmitting our thoughts what am i thinking
i dont know
i cant hear your thoughts either maybe it was a fluke
well right now we have more immediate concerns does your map show us a way out of here
yes we need to go up

theres a ledge about thirty metres up that should lead to another tunnel that connects up to the surface
right

i heard that they were not words exactly a sudden sense of fear a sense of fear of heights
so much for that being a fluke
it was a strange sensation suddenly having these thoughts appear in my mind
if you sensed a fear of heights you sensed pretty accurately
come on youve done this before its just like on a holodeck one step at a time just climbing steadily and slowly
right


i see youve done some redecorating
just a few pieces of equipment necessary for security reasons you understand
certainly
he is all right
how do you plan to get our people out of prytt territory
you must realise that everything im about to say cannot leave this room for some time we have had certain friends among the prytt citizens who realise that the long struggle between our two peoples can only end when the prytt government is made to see reason
youve recruited a few prytt spies
thats a crude but accurate term these friends will be waiting for your captain and doctor when they reach the village of ohn kor near the kes border the map we provided your officers will take them to a tavern there
forgive me ambassador but is it wise to send two human fugitives in starfleet uniforms into a prytt village
the danger is minimal our operatives control almost the whole village once contact has been made with captain picard and doctor crusher our friends will escort them across the border into kes
i would still feel better if they could rendezvous with your operatives in a less public place
commander i assure you we know what were doing weve had a great deal of experience dealing with the prytt wed hardly risk the safety of your people after all we still hope you will recommend our entrance into the federation


one of us is hungry
that would be me
do you mind thinking of something else youre making me hungry
what do you want me to think about
something other than a large bowl of vegetable soup
my grandmother used to make it with peas carrots and
beverly
im sorry
i am not being unreasonable
i didnt say that you were i may have thought it but theres a difference
youre right we cant react to every random thought that crosses the other persons mind isnt astonishing though how much clutter there is in a consciousness odd memories coming to the surface bits of halfremembered songs
stray day dreams scattered minutiae i wonder how true telepaths sift through it all how can they really get to what someones thinking if the minds keeps churning all this flotsam to the surface that is not funny
i just wanted to see if you were still listening
i think our link is getting stronger
maybe if we put some distance between us that might weaken it not that im growing tired of hearing your most intimate thoughts
certainly not

jeanluc
what happened
i was suddenly overcome with a wave of nausea
me too
theres nothing wrong with either of us maybe the air is toxic

the same thing but when you moved back toward me it got better well it seems as if were stuck with each other 
what is it
im not sure whether we should go over this hill or that one the topography on this map is a little vague
let me see this way
you dont really know do you
what
i mean youre acting like you know exactly which way to go but youre only guessing do you do this all the time
no but there are times when it is necessary for a captain to give the appearance of confidence

im sorry im sorry i just couldnt resist
im beginning to realise that you seem to always have some acerbic remark on the tip of your tongue
well at least ive trained myself not to say it anymore when i was a little girl my mouth was always landing me in trouble with my parents my teachers
your friends there was someone called tom norris
thats right i had one date with him which i brought to an abrupt halt with the words is that a beard or
is your face dirty
theres something more youre laughing but actually youre embarrassed by that incident
yes i thought i was being cute but i really hurt him that was a long time ago i learned a valuable lesson
this sharing of thoughts and feelings is quite compelling
very wed better get going

i dont think so either maybe we can find another way to reach the village
no its several kilometres to find another way around that ridge the border is just two kilometres east of here theres a forcefield protecting it but we can find some way to deal with that when we get there come on


all right
is something wrong
have a seat captain picard and doctor crusher didnt show up at the designated rendezvous point
do you know what happened to them
no we have no idea what happened to them we find it strange that your officers should follow the escape plan so precisely and then fail to make the crucial rendezvous with our operatives
it is possible they have been recaptured
our sources would have informed us instantly if that had happened of course if they werent captured if they simply made a different rendezvous we might not ever know about it
a different rendezvous im not sure i know what you mean
of course not how could you know if your captain and doctor were meeting secretly with the prytt meeting in order to set up a military alliance with the federation
what
it was a clever scheme first you pretend to lose your officers during transport then you ask us for help and get us to expose several of our undercover operatives in the process but what you didnt expect was for us to get your people out of prison so quickly they needed more time they needed more time to plot the destruction of the kes with their new prytt friends
this is ridiculous youre beginning to see conspiracies everywhere we were invited here by the kes why would we ally ourselves with the prytt
indeed why
you can believe what you like were going to find our people with or without your help
then i believe its time for us to be leaving the enterprise
fine make sure you take all this junk with you


no luck
im beginning to think theres not a single thing on this planet we can eat
well by this time tomorrow we could be back on the enterprise and you can plant yourself in front of a replicator with a knife and fork
remember that vulcan dish i promised you for breakfast i was just you hate having breakfast with me
thats not true
yes it is when i said breakfast i heard you say i hate that
thats not quite what i meant
well then what did you mean
its just that i dont like
what ive been choosing for breakfast recently
you see i think that breakfast should be a simple meal and recently youve been ordering these elaborate things
coffee and croissants thats all you really want isnt it coffee and croissants well why didnt you just say so
i didnt think it was important you dont like those elaborate meals either
no i usually prefer something simple myself but i thought you might enjoy more variety well i guess its coffee and croissants for both of us from now on
i love firelight
theres something about the flame the smell of the smoke its always seemed to me to be intoxicating somehow
i remember when jack and i took wesley on his first camping trip to balfour lake wesley kept throwing manta leaves in the fire watching them pop jack kept telling him what jeanluc i heard you dont push it away when i said jack and i i felt this sudden wave of something i didnt know you felt that way
didnt you
i guess i always knew that there was an attraction between us right from the start but i never knew how strongly you felt why didnt you ever tell me you were in love with me
you were married to my best friend at first i thought it was harmless infatuation something hormonal rather than emotional
then when the months went by and the three of us began spending more time together
i realised that it was something else and it wasnt right but although i would never act on it i couldnt help the way i felt
and when jack died you felt guilty
i felt guilty before he died having feelings like that for my best friends wife and then later after the accident i promised myself that i would never tell you know how i felt it would be like betraying my friend
thats why you didnt want me on the enterprise seven years ago
i didnt know how i would react and then little by little i realised that i didnt have those feelings any more twenty years is after all a long time
and now were friends
yes friends
well we still have a lot of ground to cover tomorrow we should get some sleep
right


ambassador thank you for coming
commander
were going to clear up this misunderstanding once and for all hail minister lorin please
aye sir
enterprise i have warned you about these unauthorised communications
yes i know but i think its about time we all sat down together and tried to work this out i have ambassador mauric here
that is your misfortune we have nothing to say to either of you

commander youre working with the prytt putting on this little show for my benefit does neither of us any good
well see mister worf

i believe theres someone waiting for us in the observation lounge

i should have known that anyone willing to deal with the kes would be capable of such an outrage
im sorry to resort to such drastic measures minister but you left me little choice
dont pretend the two of you are enemies its too late for charades
if that is an attempt to hide your military alliance with the federation you neednt bother i already know far more than you can imagine
lets all just sit down and try to talk about whats happened to captain picard and doctor crusher
i will not sit at a table with him
no more than i would sit with her
all right then well stand the important thing is that we start talking
i am not authorised to talk with a kes official
all right then you talk to me where are my officers
as if you dont already know


lets go

im all right


we are already aware of your plan to use federation technology to build new attack satellites you will find that we are prepared for them
that is an interesting but pointless lie id rather discuss your own plans to use federation aid to stage a takeover of kolrod island
we have been over this before kolrod clearly belongs to the prytt who originally
thats it i can see that diplomacy is not going to get us anywhere today and i do not have time for to negotiate so lets put all of our cards on the table youre concerned the kes are going to be admitted to the federation
correct
as first officer of the enterprise i think i can promise you thats not going to happen the kes will be denied membership
you have no authority to make that decision despite whatever games you played with the prytt when you arrived we still plan to take our petition directly to the federation council theyll listen
they will also listen to the reports of the captain of the enterprise and his first officer and i can tell you right now the first officers report will go something like this kesprytt a deeply troubled world with social political and military problems they have yet to resolve the kes while a friendly and democratic people are driven by suspicion deviousness and paranoia it is the opinion of this officer they are not ready for membership now the matter of our missing officers
they are still charged with spying commander i have heard nothing here which would alter that
then maybe you should consider this if anything happens to them starfleet is going to want a full investigation which means more starships will be coming to kesprytt and those ships are going to want answers which puts your country under a very large and very uncomfortable microscope remember how unhappy you were when we contacted just one of your people without authorisation well just think of what itll be like ten starships asking questions contacting hundreds of your people massive sensor sweeps they may even start sending down away teams all because you wouldnt help me find my missing officers

i think i can use the tricorder to set up a multiphase pulse that should weaken the field enough to let us through
no no the modulation frequency is in the upper harmonic range
right
theyre coming
im working as fast as i can

minister we have the human female the male is standing in kes territory

very well transmit their coordinates to the enterprise transporter room
understood
thank you minister now if youll excuse me

mauric is determined to take his protest to the federation council but i dont think hell get very far
i tend to agree number one

did i miss something
of course of course youre absolutely right


that was wonderful
my pleasure
dont get me wrong jeanluc but im glad were not joined at the hip anymore
so were you getting tired of my company
just tired of bumping into you every thirty seconds i was beginning to feel as if you were part of my uniform
 to freedom
freedom penny for your thoughts
i was just thinking that as distracting as it was i was beginning to get used to hearing your thoughts and i find that i miss it
so do i it was very intimate you know last night i couldnt sleep
oh
i was awake for several hours and thanks to the implants i got to hear some very interesting dreams of yours
a man cant be held responsible for what his mind does while hes asleep
what about when hes awake
so now that weve had this unique experience what do we do
what do you mean
you know exactly what i mean
no i dont the implants been removed remember
now that we know how each of us feels perhaps we should not be afraid to explore those feelings

or perhaps we should be afraid i think i should be going now

goodnight
goodnight

force of nature



geordi
in here data

got her now shes trapped come on out of there you hey dont you spit at me
why is spot under the bed
probably because she knows if i catch her im going to kill her
has spot been misbehaving
so far shes broken a vase a teapot shes ruined one of my chairs using it as a scratch post and shes coughing hairballs up all over my carpet
these incidents are common to cat owners when you borrowed spot you said you wanted to experience the full range of feline behaviour before getting a cat yourself
yeah well im not ready you can take her back with my blessings go ahead call her
spot does not respond to verbal commands
she wont come when you call her data have you ever considered training this cat
i never found it to be necessary
necessary data the cat is out of control half the time i wasnt sure if she was going to lick me or scratch my face off
i have never experienced this kind of behaviour in spot although she does have the unfortunate habit of jumping on my computer console when i am working
she needs training
riker to senior staff please report to the observation lounge mission briefing in ten minutes
right we have to get her out of here ill scare her you grab her when she comes out okay
i do not think it would be wise to startle her
ready ow

training definitely
captains log stardate  were investigating the disappearance of the medical transport fleming somewhere in the hekaras corridor our search is complicated by the unique properties of this particular region of space

the flemings last contact with starfleet was four days ago according to them there was nothing out of the ordinary when they entered the corridor
data

the unusually intense tetryon fields in this sector pose a severe navigational hazard to warp driven vessels the hekaras corridor is the only route through the area which is free of tetryon fields ships travelling at warp must use the corridor to ensure safe passage through the region
how long will it take to complete a level one search
at least two days sir the corridor is over twelve light years long and the surrounding tetryon interference will limit our sensor range
could we send out reconnaissance probes to supplement the sensors
they wont be very effective the interference will make it difficult to maintain contact with the probes the best we can do is to increase sensor efficiency weve installed multiphase buffers on all the sensor modules captain it should help a little
hekaras two is inhabited isnt it maybe theyve had contact with the fleming
they havent ive already spoken to the hekaran government according to them only one ship has passed through the system in the last week it was a ferengi trader
the fleming was carrying a supply of rare biomimetic gel which is very valuable is it possible that the ferengi might have hijacked it
i wouldnt put it past them i think we should prepare for that contingency
i agreed all right then mister worf initiate your search pattern lets head in


geordi there has been a slight drop in sensor efficiency perhaps we should examine the phase buffers
no problem data ill be right with you okay hansen transfer eps conduit thirteen to the stabiliser matrix
aye sir
is there a problem with the engines
no
then why are you stabilizing the eps conduit
im just trying to get a slightly higher power conversion level
but that would not affect the engines in any way
i know that data its not the point
what is the point
im just trying to get a higher conversion level thats all
why
you know the intrepid
yes
well their chief engineer is commander donald kaplan he and i went through the academy together i just like to make sure that our power conversion levels are a little higher than theirs
i understand you are in competition with mister kaplan
you might say that this is the flagship we should be better than everybody else
then you are trying to outperform the intrepid
actually its more a point of personal pride these are my engines and theres nothing wrong with a little friendly rivalry okay computer how much have the conversion levels increased
levels are unchanged
all right ill deal with of this later let me give you a hand with those sensors


hows that
one moment the phase buffer is functioning within normal parameters sensor efficiency has increased by six point seven percent
six point seven one of the stages must still be out of alignment lets try junction a nine

geordi i have taken your suggestion regarding spot
coming down
i have begun training her
really
yes i am studying several new techniques

i began with simple conditioned response exercises and followed with environmental enhancement next i plan to explore bioconditioning devices
devices
such as sensor nets for behaviour modification or biofeedback motivators unfortunately i have been less than successful
ive got an idea how about a phaser a low stun setting at just the right moment might do the trick
geordi i cannot stun my cat
i was kidding data  lets see what weve got no this isnt it either
clearly there is a misalignment somewhere in this system
thats for sure well weve got one more possibility junction c twelve
i am somewhat concerned that my training efforts will ultimately fail
maybe youre just going about it the wrong way data
i have consulted numerous animal training manuals some of them claim that cats are inherently untrainable
i dont believe that for a second listen to me my sister didnt know a thing about animals and she was able to train her cat how complicated could it be
what did she train her cat to do
she had that cat jumping into her arms on command
interesting perhaps i could modify your sisters techniques to keep spot from jumping on console do you know how she was able to train her cat
well as i recall she walked around for two months with a piece of tuna in her blouse

i was right this buffer is out of alignment okay try that
phase alignment is stabilised however sensor efficiency has increased by only an additional one point three percent
its not much but every little bit going to help
riker to data
data here
were picking up a ship ahead on long range sensors if you and geordi are through down there wed like to have you on the bridge
were not going to squeeze anything else out of these systems
acknowledged sir we are on our way

we are within visual range sir
on screen
it is a ferengi transport ship dkora class
thats the same ferengi vessel that entered the corridor a week ago
captain there are no emissions from their plasma vents their warp drive must be completely inactive
that is correct sir their impulse system is down as well power generation is at extremely low levels
what about life signs
life support systems are also functioning at low levels there are approximately four hundred fifty ferengi on board that is a standard complement for a ship of that class
mister worf open a hailing frequency
there is no response on any channel sir
im not picking any subspace emissions from the ship at all captain it looks like every one of their field coils has been overloaded
that would explain why they havent respond to our hails
it would also explain the failure of their warp drive
captain ferengi sensors are still online i could modify one of our deflector emitters to transmit old style delta waves if i modulate that with a comm signal the ferengi should be able to pick that up
make it so
if they did hijack the fleming they sure didnt get very far with the cargo
mister worf have tractor beams standing by we may have to take them under tow helm take us within tractor range
 aye sir
captain i am picking up power emissions from the ferengi ship they are locking weapons
shields up

ready phasers prepare to return fire
target their weapons array only
phasers locked
fire
direct hit their weapon systems are down
damage report
we sustained minimal damage to decks five and seven sir
sir the ferengi ships power has stabilised they appear to have impulse capability
they were just playing dead conserving power until we got in close enough
but why would they attack us in the first place
somehow i dont think theyll let us beam over there and ask them
mister la forge how are you coming with that comm link
almost ready captain all right lets give it a try
open a channel

this is captain jeanluc picard of the enterprise will you please explain why you attacked us
our attack we were defending ourselves do you deny that you are responsible for disabling my vessel
daimon your ship was adrift your communications inoperative we were attempting to assess your status
you were attempting to move in for the kill do not toy with me picard we are obviously at your mercy but know this when the ferengi council learns of your actions they will consider this an act of war
daimon clearly there has been some misunderstanding i think it would be in all interests if you were to come aboard and we discuss this situation
i see no reason to trust you human
in that case well be on our way ill relay your position to your government if you wish in case youre unable to complete your repairs and you remain stranded
perhaps it would be better to discuss the situation

we detected what appeared to be a federation signal buoy when we approached it it emitted a massive verteron pulse our warp drive our sensors our communications systems were all disabled we assumed we were the victims of a new federation weapon
the federation established this corridor to ensure safe access through this sector we have nothing to gain from mining it
whatever happened to your ship may not have been an isolated incident a federation medical transport was recently lost in that corridor
we passed a federation ship several days ago it did not appear to be in any distress
can you give us an idea of its heading
it is possible that information was recorded in our sensor logs commander unfortunately my entire crew is occupied with our repairs i dont think there will be time to search our records
daimon if we assigned an engineering team to assist you with your repair efforts would that give you time to retrieve your logs
i believe it would captain


spot spot spot down spot down down spot  down this is down down is good this is up up is no

 one moment come in
data i had another idea that might help boost the power conversion levels could you give me a hand
i would be happy to
dont tell me youre trying to teach the cat to use the console
it is part of her training programme i am teaching spot to jump down from the desk on my command
hows it going
i have not been entirely successful

feline supplement number two twenty one
data that cat definitely has a mind of her own maybe shes just not trainable
i suppose i must accept that possibility it may be that spot lacks the intelligence necessary to learn the appropriate responses to my commands

i dont know about spot but it seems to me your training is coming along just fine come on lets go

data keep the eps flow constant will you while i re modulate the power taps
this procedure will only increase the conversion level by point eight percent
i know but it could be just enough
enough
i just received this from commander kaplan subspace

la forge i got the intrepids power conversion levels up to ninety seven point one percent maybe you should try cleaning your plasma grid once in a while
can you believe the nerve of that guy
we perform maintenance on the plasma grid at regular intervals
i know hes just trying to get me angry there that should do it computer what are the current power conversion levels
power conversion levels are at ninety seven point two percent
too bad mister kaplan
captains log supplemental we have traced the flemings most likely course it now appears that the vessel may have come to an unfortunate end


whats the origin of this debris field
unknown sir it does not appear in any federation charts of the corridor
could it be whats left of the fleming
it is a possibility the debris consists primarily of duranium and polycomposite fragments which suggest a ship furthermore the field contains sufficient mass to account for the fleming
all right lets take a closer look perhaps we can find something that will give us a more positive identification helm take us through the debris field ahead slow
captain i am picking up a small metallic object approximately three point five metres in diameter
could be a ships log recorder or a probe casing
i do not believe so it is emitting an unusual signal captain it is beginning to generate a verteron field
shields up full reverse now

damage report
warp engines are offline shields are down all subspace systems are inoperative
just like the ferengi ship
unidentified ship heading toward us two life forms are aboard
on screen
captain they are initiating their transporter system
can we get more power to the shields
no sir
all decks security alert
captain we are being boarded
la forge to bridge

we have intruders in main engineering i need a security team down here immediately
its on its way
what do you want
 were trying to make you listen
 youre killing us

you have made a very serious accusation i want you to explain it
captain according to our research warp fields cause a dangerous reaction in this region of space
our planet is already being affected we have measured large gravitational shifts throughout our system
if something isnt done our planet will become uninhabitable
captain ive heard this theory before their research was evaluated by the federation science council a few years ago quite frankly it didnt hold up
that research was only preliminary our original analysis was incomplete
if you wanted us to review your research you should have made a request through the science council
their resources are limited it would have taken over a year before they dispatched a science ship to come and evaluate our work
we were not willing to wait any longer we knew that if we disabled enough ships starfleet would come then at least we would be able to present our case
thats how you rationalise these attacks
neither you nor the ferengi suffered any casualties commander the actual damage to your vessels was negligible
we dispersed verteron probes in the corridor merely to disable warpdriven ships nothing more
you can call it whatever you like the fact remains you deliberately disguised your probes you made them look like signal markers you hid them in debris field you mined the corridor
mister la forge how long do you estimate it will take to restore the engines
their verteron pulse overloaded our field coils captain itll take at least thirty six hours to get underway
i know precisely how our pulse affected your field coils with my help your ship could be operational in ten hours provided you agree to review our research
because of the seriousness of your claim im willing to listen to your case but let there be no mistake our priority here is the recovery of the fleming now i expect you to help us restore our engines and deactivate all of the remaining probes in the corridor if you do not you will both be taken to the brig and from there to the nearest starbase where you will answer charges for what you have done
my sister and i do not wish to impede your rescue process
rabal dont the probes are the only leverage we have if we
serova we will do as you ask captain but please reexamine our data
we will it is part of our job to retain an open mind even under these circumstances mister la forge take them to engineering get the core back online
yes sir
mister data i want you to review their research id like your report as soon as possible

there shields have been restored you will be able to reengage your engines in approximately eight hours
you know even when we get the engines online its going to take at least a week to recalibrate them properly
im sorry youve been inconvenienced but thats all it is an inconvenience our concerns are much more important than the condition of your engines
what if the fleming had been transporting perishable supplies or was on an emergency mission your little plan might have cost a lot of lives
that didnt happen commander and saving lives is precisely what were trying to do
yeah well you have a very interesting way of going about it
theres no point in trying to talk to you youve already decided not to listen

commander i know my sister can be somewhat er aggravating
id have to agree with that
but please try to understand she believes profoundly in this cause she has sworn to dedicate her life to exposing the dangers of warp drive
warp drive has been around for three centuries its a proven technology
and you sound just like i did about four years ago
you mean you didnt believe her either
no what i didnt realise was just how brilliant my sister is it took two years of study for me even to grasp the principles behind her theoretical models theyre that sophisticated
well our commander datas no slouch if theres anything there hell find it
well i hope so because once we persuade starfleet to stop warp travel through the corridor were going to have to convince our own people to give up warp drive completely
hekaras two is the only inhabited world in this region without warp drive youd be completely isolated from the rest of the federation are you really willing to take that step
yes and if you were in my position i hope youd be willing to do the same thing

serova and rabal believe there are regions of potential subspace instability within the corridor they believe that if these regions continue to be exposed to warp field energy they will rupture subspace will extrude into normal space forming a rift
its like pacing up and down on the same piece of carpet eventually you wear it out
that analogy is essentially correct sir
can this theory be proven
not at this time sir there is insufficient evidence to do so in order to determine whether or not a rift will form region must be exposed to warp field energy approximately one million times greater than that normally generated by a starship
commander we believe the warp field effect is cumulative each starship that passes through the corridor at warp brings us one step closer to forming a rift
i agree that is a possibility captain i suggest we ask the federation science council to send a research vessel to this area a more detailed investigation would resolve many of our questions
thats your response more research more delays i suppose i shouldnt have expected anything different
bridge to captain picard
go ahead number one
weve located the

fleming on long range sensors approximately zero point three light years away
whats their condition
the vessel appears to be intact they have shields but it looks like their subspace systems are out
very well

well be underway as soon as our engines are online
aye sir
i would like you all to put together a research proposal for the science council ill give it my full recommendation
captain i appreciate the opportunity youre giving us its a beginning that we need
not we you can do whatever you want rabal ill have no part of this its just another delay

captain the engines are back online all systems are ready
very good helm lay in a course for the fleming
aye sir
they appear to be in pretty good condition according to our sensors their shields back to full strength
captain the hekaran ship is moving off there is one person on board it is serova
doctor what is going on
i dont know captain may i speak to her
mister worf open a channel
serova what are you trying to do
they wanted proof im going to give it to them im sorry
captain the hekaran ships engines are beginning to overload i believe serovas attempting to create a warp core breach
no
prepare for impact

shields at maximum full reverse
report
we have cleared the shock wave however tetryon flux in the area is increasing rapidly

its incredible
mister data whats your analysis
the event is approximately zero point one light years in diameter and it is emitting extremely high levels of tetryon radiation it appears to be what rabal and serova predicted a subspace rift
she was right
can you get a fix on the fleming is she still in one piece
scanning the fleming is near its previous coordinates it appears to be intact but it is now within the rift
doctor is it possible for a ship to survive in there doctor im sorry about your loss but we need your help now
of course captain
does the rift pose any danger to the fleming
i dont know

what was that
some kind of high energy distortion wave looks like theyre being generated from within the rift
if we maintain our current position our shields should provide sufficient protection
what about the fleming how long can they survive in there
the waves are even more intense within the rift i estimate her shields will fail in approximately twelve hours
can we risk going in there to get them out
not at warp commander according to these readings the rift is in a state of accelerating instability which would make it extremely sensitive to warp field energy if we go in at warp we might make it expand even further
i dont think we have a choice it would take weeks to reach them at impulse
i want some better options data geordi take doctor rabal and begin an analysis of the rift we need to find some way to get the fleming out of there
second officers log stardate  our new sensor readings have greatly improved our understanding of the rift however we have been unable to find any way to counteract it

everything here supports serovas theories i cant find any way to close the rift or even reduce its size

doctor is it possible there are areas inside the rift which are stable where we can safely use our warp engines
perhaps computer scan the rift for regions of low instability

theres no area stable enough to withstand a warp pulse
wait a minute this is strange computer display grid delta seventeen enhance and magnify what do you make of that
its a subspace instability outside the rift
that should not be possible
commander im going to begin a field enhanced scan of this sector id like to take a closer look at this
in the meantime wed better tell the captain we dont know how to get to the fleming
i am not certain that is true i believe i have an idea

i suggest we coast into the rift
coast
we can initiate a brief high intensity warp pulse from our current position we should be able to attain sufficient velocity to enter the rift beam the crew off the fleming and exit without using our warp engines
all right lets say we initiate a full power warp pulse how much time do we need to drop out of warp
if we field saturate the nacelles we should be able to sustain warp speed for approximately two minutes
that doesnt give us much time and it could get pretty rough in there
the timing will be critical
begin your calculations mister data well go as soon as youre ready
aye sir

i believe the maximum saturation level should be eighteen point three percent
all right with these parameters we should be able to maintain warp speed for two minutes eight seconds i dont think we can get any more than that
i agree but based on the size of the rift it should give us sufficient time to complete the rescue computer initiate nacelle field saturation
how did we miss it data
i beg your pardon
how did we miss the connection between warp drive and the formation of the rift between the two of us weve logged thousands of hours on these engines were supposed to be warp field experts we certainly were wrong this time
technically geordi we were not wrong serovas theories rested on assumptions which were unprovable
seems to me she managed to prove them pretty conclusively
by using methods any reputable scientist would never employ
yeah she was willing to die to make her point we should have listened to her more closely data
we reviewed serovas research to the best of our abilities and we were prepared to continue studying the problem but that was not satisfactory
yeah i can remember times when i was a little stubborn trying to get people to believe me when i didnt have enough proof
i do not believe that you would have resorted to such extremes
but she had to just to get us to listen why was i so resistant
perhaps because her aggressive methods created an adversarial situation
yeah maybe i was taking the whole thing personally
i do not understand
maybe i was a little threatened the thought that warp engines might be doing some kind of damage its going to take another half an hour for the nacelles to saturate will you call me when theyre done


commander
may i join you

i wanted to say im sorry about your sister
thank you im trying to tell myself that she died for what she believed in but somehow that isnt much comfort
i wish it could have happened differently maybe i should have looked at the research more closely its possible theres something that i missed
no you didnt miss anything the problem was time we needed more time to do the proper research serova wasnt willing to wait
no i guess the question is now where do we go from here
i dont think we can look at space travel the same way anymore were going to have to change
ive been in starfleet for a long time we depend on warp drive i just dont know how easy its going to be to change
it wont be easy at all

captain warp pulse calculations are complete we will be firing the engines at maximum intensity for six point three seconds before disengaging
damage control teams are standing by on all decks
the course to the fleming is plotted and laid in sir
mister la forge whenever youre ready
aye sir

initiating warp pulse now

engines disengaged we are now entering the rift  hull stress is increasing eighty three percent of maximum tolerance and rising
how long until we reach the fleming
one minute twenty two seconds
all transporter rooms are standing by
captain i am picking up power emissions from the fleming they may be attempting to initiate their warp drive
they might have been able to repair their engines
captain if they activate
i know mister data can we establish communication
no sir subspace interference is too high
how long until we reach transporter range
fifty three seconds
i dont think were going to make it
captain they have initiated their warp drive

report
damage on decks six and fourteen our structural integrity field is holding
what about the fleming
they are badly damaged sir their life support systems are failing
all transporter rooms prepare emergency evacuation procedures
captain when the fleming activated their warp drive the rift expanded by two point three percent we no longer have sufficient momentum to escape

distortion wave intensity has increased by a factor of ten
we are within transporter range of the fleming sir commencing evacuation procedures
distortion waves occurring every fifty nine seconds hull stress is nearing maximum tolerance
data what if we forced an eps discharge through the impulse reactor would that be enough to get us out of here
i do not believe so sir and the resulting explosion would likely destroy the saucer section in the process
captain

we might be able to get out of here without using the warp engines
how geordi
when was the last time you went surfing commander

a distortion wave
exactly captain if can phase match our deflector shield

to the em variance of the distortion wave when the next one hits well be pulled along with it

we could ride it through the rift and then break away once were clear that is if we survive the ride
is everyone off the fleming
the last of the crew has been beamed aboard sir
all right mister la forge get us out of here

yes sir phase matching the deflectors shield now

the next distortion wave will impact in fourteen seconds

matching phases prepare to engage the deflector shield on my mark
ten seconds
and mark

engage deflector shield full power


we lost it

we were unable to maintain phase match with the distortion wave sir
what went wrong mister la forge
the speed differential was too high captain
another distortion wave approaching impact in twenty six seconds
our hull stress is already critical we cant handle many more jolts like that
captain i suggest we take the ship to full impulse if we can attain sufficient speed it will lessen the shock when the wave hits
helm full impulse head us out of the rift mister worf channel all available power to the structural integrity fields
aye sir
stand by deflector shield

were ready captain

distortion wave impact in five seconds
engage deflector shield now

we are now within the distortion wave hull stresses have exceeded maximum tolerance
structural integrity fields are failing on decks ten through sixteen switching to backups

were separating from the distortion wave im attempting to compensate

how much longer until we clear the rift
approximately twelve seconds sir hull stresses one hundred twenty percent above tolerance
a structural breach is imminent

we have cleared the rift sir hull stress has returned to normal
cancel red alert
captains log stardate  we have been continuing our research while the federation council studies our preliminary reports on the subspace rift it now appears certain that what weve seen here will have repercussions for many years to come

our scans have shown a lot of subspace instabilities throughout the sector if theyre exposed to enough warp energies they could eventually create other rifts
doctor rabal
based on current warp drive patterns in the sector weve projected where subspace rifts will be most likely to be formed over the next forty years this is the way things are now this is how theyll look in ten years twenty years thirty years forty years

thank you doctor mister la forge

ah weve received new directives from the federation council on this matter until we can find a way to counteract the warp field effect the council feels our best course is to slow the damage as much as possible therefore areas of space found susceptible to warp fields will be restricted to essential travel only and effective immediately all federation vessels will be limited to a speed of warp five except in cases of extreme emergency
the klingons will observe these restrictions but the romulans will not
and what about the ferengi and the cardassians for that matter
the federations sharing all our data with warpcapable species we can only hope that they realise its in their own interests and take similar action
putting limits on warp speed is only going to prevent other rifts from forming what are we going to do about this one
unfortunately right now theres not much we can do
the gravitational shifts have already begun to affect my planets orbit our climate is changing
the federation is setting up a weather control matrix on hekaras two its only a temporary solution but it should suffice for now
were lucky the rift took place as far away from the planet as it did it gives us some time to consider our options
if there are no more questions youre all dismissed

we should have those thermal stabilisers ready for the hekarans in another day sir
very well you know geordi i spent the better part of my life exploring space ive charted new worlds ive met dozens of new species and i believe that these were all valuable ends in themselves now it seems that all this while i was helping to damage the thing that i hold most dear
its wont turn out that way captain we still have time to make it better
inheritance

captains log stardate  the atrean government has requested assistance in averting a natural disaster two of their geologists have come aboard one of whom is a human who has been living on atrea four

captain our situation has worsened since my husband and i first contacted you the molten core of our planet is not just cooling its begun to solidify
our gravitational field has been affected seismic activity has increased by a factor of three
if the cooling continues at this rate atrea will become uninhabitable in thirteen months
we could minimise seismic activity by creating isobaric fissures and relieving some of the tectonic stress but that would just be a temporary fix
the only permanent solution would be to reliquefy the core
these pockets in the magma layer how close are they to the molten region of the core
a few kilometres why
data do you think thats close enough for ferroplasmic infusion
the procedure will involve using the ships phasers to drill down through the planets surface into the pockets where we would set up a series of plasma infusion units
well trigger the units by firing modulated energy bursts down through the shafts
i see injecting sufficient plasma directly into the core should trigger a chain reaction and that will reliquify the magma
it should be possible to stabilise the core temperature at ninety three percent of normal
if it works the core would remain molten for centuries
if you give your permission we could begin immediately
very well but before we proceed id like to update our geological surveys
fine id be very happy to help you with that doctor
ive assigned you quarters during out time here please make yourselves comfortable
thank you captain

data
yes doctor
do you have any idea who i am
you are doctor juliana tainer
you lost all your early memories we thought you would but we couldnt be certain
have we met before
oh data i was there right at the beginning on omicron theta i helped create you now look at you
you were a colleague of doctor soong
yes i certainly was and i was also his wife in a way i suppose you could say i am your mother

i still cant believe im seeing you like this again after all these years
doctor i have no memory of you
oh theres a reason for that we wiped your processors after we finished refining your programming why dont you tell me what you do remember and then ill fill in the gaps
my memory record begins when i was activated by the starfleet officers on the omicron theta outpost
after the attack of the crystalline entity
yes all of the inhabitants of the colony were killed however i discovered that my memory banks contained the contents of their journals and logs
we hoped their experiences would be useful after your childhood we figured you could use all the help you could get
my childhood
thats what i called it you were like a baby at first a hundred kilogram baby but still you had trouble learning your motor skills learning how to process sensory information and of course noonian was never satisfied he kept tinkering trying to make you as human as possible
so you wiped my memory processors after this childhood
then we deactivated you and programmed you with the colonists logs we had planned to reactivate you but we never got the chance thats when the crystalline entity attacked we had to leave quickly we wanted to take you with us but there was only room for two in the escape pod
doctor i have scanned the journals of the colonists there is only one juliana mentioned in them her last name was odonnell
thats me
but there was no mention that my father was married to you
because of my mother she thought that noonian was an eccentric scientist who was too old for me we decided to marry secretly to give her a chance to get used to our being together we slipped away to mavala four and got married there a klingon and a corvallan trader were our witnesses it wasnt exactly the wedding id hoped for somehow noonian had a way of making even the oddest things seem romantic
my father did have an unusual way of looking at things
how would you know that
i encountered him once in the terlina system
thats where we went to after we left the outpost i had no idea that youd even met him
it was shortly before his death
hes dead
yes
i had no idea it would hit me this hard we didnt exactly part on the best of terms
what do you mean
i realised he loved his work as much as he loved me maybe more there we were stuck on this planet in the middle of the jungle with no one else to talk to no life it just wasnt enough thats why i left that was all a very very long time ago the important thing is that were here now together and i do want to get to know you
this has been an interesting encounter and an altogether unexpected one i would like to corroborate your story before we proceed further excuse me doctor

data im almost finished reconfiguring the phaser banks we should be able to start drilling in about an hour
inform me when you are ready
what is it youre doing over there
i am attempting to ascertain whether doctor tainers story is true
dont you believe her
i neither believe nor doubt i am simply attempting to verify her assertions
well what have you turned up so far
the registrars office on mavala four cannot confirm whether doctor soong was married there apparently many of the documents were lost when the government was overthrown
whats that youre looking at
i am checking passenger manifests to see if they went to mavala during the period in question odonnell juliana soong noonian they were both passengers on a transport which travelled from omicron theta to mavala and returned four days later
that sure fits with her story
still the fact that they went to mavala does not prove they were married there
you know data it almost seems to me like youre trying to prove that doctor tainer wasnt telling the truth
not at all i am merely unable to reconcile her story with the fact that my father never mentioned her to me
well she did leave him maybe she broke his heart maybe he just didnt want to talk about her let me ask you this doctor soong created an emotion chip didnt lore tell you that chip also contained memories memories soong wanted you to have
yes it is possible that those are memories of my childhood and of mrs soong
when you think about it why would she want to lie why would anybody want to pretend to be your mother
i can think of no motive for such a pretense
and i can understand that this might all be a little disconcerting for you data it came out of the blue and it doesnt fit into your logical processors
that is true
but thats life data part of being human is learning how to deal with the unexpected to risk new experiences even when they dont fit into your preconceptions
i admit i am finding it difficult to accept the possibility of a past about which i know nothing but it is also true that i am curious to learn more about it


data
i would like to get to know you better mother

i wanted to make you female but your father insisted on a son we argued about it endlessly right up until we were ready to assemble you
how did you decide
noonian walked in with your head in his hand and innocent as you please said it was up to me he knew perfectly well what he was doing once again he had made it in his own image what could i possibly say  deanna troi is that who youre going to visit
yes
your father would be so pleased
pleased
he was worried that the sexuality programme he designed for you wouldnt work
you misunderstand counsellor troi is a therapist
goodnight

we will be in position over the drilling site in three minutes twenty nine seconds

these scans indicate that the magma pockets where we plan to set up the infusion units are somewhat unstable
im going to monitor the density of the rock layers and adjust the strength of the particle beam as we go that should minimise the seismic stress that we generate while were drilling
data i reconfigured the phasers to create the most highly focused particle beam possible
thank you geordi
im just so pleased youve got good manners it wasnt easy to strike the right balance with your programming at first you couldnt have cared less about the social niceties like please and thank you you were downright rude in fact
data thats hard to picture
that was nothing to the problems we encountered never mind i dont want to embarrass you
i am incapable of embarrassment please continue
well the one thing we couldnt anticipate was that you didnt seem to mind about being naked some of the colonists objected to having an anatomically correct android running around without any clothes on we asked you to dress but you didnt feel it was necessary because you didnt suffer from the elements we actually had to write a modesty subroutine to get you to keep your clothes on
bridge to engineering
la forge here go ahead commander
weve established a synchronous orbit over the drilling site
phaser modifications are online sir
my calculations indicate

the first phaser blast will be approximately nineteen seconds in duration
acknowledged
someones checked his calculations of course
no but im sure mister data knows what hes doing
even so he is a machine someone should check up on him
i have complete confidence in mister datas ability to check up on himself mister worf
phasers locked on target
fire when ready

we are within two kilometres of the magma pocket
another five seconds should do it weve broken through

terminating the beam

the pocket seems stable
i detect no increase in the stress levels of the surrounding magma
good work data

i dont think we could have gotten it any cleaner
we have data to thank for that i couldnt have done it without him his figures were perfect

the drilling process has raised the temperature in the magma pockets by almost three hundred degrees celsius it will be several hours before it cools enough for us to enter
data do you have any plans right now
i do not
maybe we should spend a little time together id love to see your quarters


thank you i will be playing this piece at a recital tomorrow evening
that was beautiful
i have been told that my playing is technically flawless but no one has described it as beautiful
it was really
are you certain you are not saying this because you are my mother i have noticed that parents tend to exaggerate when it comes to their childrens accomplishments
i suppose theres a certain amount of vanity involved considering that giving you a creative aspect was my idea your father didnt really see the point he thought that since you didnt have emotions there would be no real need for you to express yourself somehow i had the feeling the opposite would be true
i do not know for certain but i believe it is during my creative endeavours that i come closest to experiencing what it must be like to be human
well im glad i insisted
as am i
data im very familiar with that handel piece how would you feel about my playing the viola part tomorrow
i would like that very much
ill have to practice you dont have a viola
i could replicate one for you computer please replicate one viola
did you paint these
yes i am attempting to master all known styles of painting this one is in the style of the early french impressionists
its very good whos this
that is lal my daughter
your daughter
i created her using myself as a model
where is she now
the positronic matrix i designed for her was unstable she only lived a short time
i see
in a sense you were her grandmother would you like to practice now
yes yes of course


the acoustics in ten forward are most favourable
yes yes very nice data may i ask you something
of course
do you think youll ever try to create an android again
perhaps i created lal because i wished to procreate despite what happened to her i still have that wish
how do you know the same thing wont happen creating a stable positronic matrix is very tricky your father lost several prototypes before lore
i was not aware he created other androids before my brother
there were three of them they were like children to us losing them was very painful when noonian decided to try again i was very much against it i didnt think we had the right to bring a life into the world with so little chance of surviving but your father was sure that hed figured out what went wrong insisted he could make a stable matrix and he did but lore was cruel evil eventually we had no choice we had to dismantle him your father decided to build yet another android one who didnt have emotions i couldnt believe he would want to try again
i am that android are you saying you were against my creation
initially i was but i was wrong i know that now ive followed your progress for years im very proud of what youve accomplished
then why did you never attempt to contact me
because i felt guilty about something id done
perhaps if you told me what has made you feel this way it may alleviated the guilt
i lied when i said there was no room for you in the escape pod that we took from omicron there was i didnt want to bring you with us i was afraid if we reactivated you youd turn out like lore i made noonian leave you behind

we are within four kilometres of the magma pocket

were picking up feedback pulses along the particle beam
we must have hit a pocket of magnesite ore ill try to adjust the phaser harmonics to compensate
data were going to have to terminate the beam if this keeps up
if we do we will have to begin a new shaft at a suitable location
there is no other suitable location just give me a few more seconds
doctor its going to take longer than that to match the

you did it
it was just luck i hit the right frequency all right were less than two kilometres away from the target site stand by to terminate the beam
weve broken through
now
i am detecting no signs of

instability
commander may i suggest we set up the infusion unit in the first magma pocket and give this one a chance to cool
data

doctor tainer well meet you in transporter room two
acknowledged


i have initialised the plasma induction coils
ill need another minute to align the diverter

there are signs of stress in the surrounding magma but the site should remain stable until we finish the plasma infusion
good were almost done here
data juliana told me what she said to you last night shes been very upset i dont blame you for being angry with her
i am incapable of anger
its all right pran i know what i said to you must have been hard to hear but i hope you understand my reasons
i am not certain i do perhaps you could clarify them for me
well ill try what do you want to know
if i had been your biological offspring would you have left me on omicron theta
oh data how can i answer that
doctor tainer i get the impression you are trying to spare my feelings i assure you that is not necessary
i just dont want you to misunderstand my answer no i wouldnt have left you behind if youd been my biological child
is that because you place more value on biological life than on artificial life
absolutely not i cherished every android your father and i created as if it were my child even lore despite the fact that he turned on us despite the dreadful things he did dismantling him was the most difficult thing i ever had to do i was afraid that if you turned out like him i would have to dismantle you too and i couldnt bear to do that im not trying to justify leaving you behind im just sorry i did i hope you believe me
i do thank you for making it clear to me


bravo bravo

data why do you want to look at doctor tainers medical records is something wrong with her
i was hoping you would be able to determine that from her transporter trace pattern
well probably i could but ordinarily i dont check somebodys medical status without a good reason
doctor i would ask that you not require me to be more specific i assure you i have a good reason for asking
all right data at first glance i see nothing wrong with her except for a mild case of hypertension which is normal for a woman her age
i see
maybe you should tell me what her symptoms are
she has not complained of any discomfort
then why do you want to see her medical records
because i have reason to believe she is not who she claims to be
bridge to data
go ahead sir
theres been a cavein in one of the magma pockets youre needed in transporter room two
on my way excuse me doctor


what happened

we were running a final check on the infusion units when a part of the wall gave way
it looks like the area has stabilised but seismic stress is building up eventually the pocket will collapse
how long geordi
its tough to tell commander twelve hours at most
then we must finish configuring the unit and inject the plasma immediately

id rather not send anyone back down there
if you dont do it

now commander it may take months to find another suitable site the core may solidify by then
shes right we have to act now
all right but i want you in and out of there as quickly as possible
acknowledged
youre hurt ill go


there will be more seismic activity we must hurry

the shaft has not been obstructed by the seismic activity it should be possible to trigger the unit from orbit
the infusers been damaged were going to have to start the programming sequence all over again
priming the energytransfer matrix
reinitialising the particle stream buffer
riker to data are you there
go ahead sir
were reading an increase in seismic stress levels
understood sir we will attempt to expedite our work
there now we just have to realign the diverter

data are you all right
yes sir well be returning to the beamout point shortly
thats it lets go

can we transport without the pattern enhancers
no we are too far below the surface
how are we going to get down there
there are no handholds in the rock face we are going to have to jump
no its too far i wont make it
you will



basically shes a soongtype android except everything about her is designed to fool you into thinking shes human
shes got tear ducts sweat glands even veins and capillaries underneath her skin
why does the scanner read her as a human
because she has a feedback processor designed to send out a false biosignal
its part of her aging programme not only does she age in appearance like data her vital signs change too
what i cant figure out is why she lost consciousness as far as i can see everything is fine she should be awake
check her positronic matrix there may be a cascade anomaly
you said you knew she was an android how
the first indication occurred when we were digging i saw her perform complex calculations without the assistance of the computer
that could have just meant she was good at math
that is true but it was enough to get my attention later i noticed something odd about the way she blinked her eyes the intervals between blinks were governed by the fourier system the same mathematical formula my father used to give my blinking pattern the appearance of randomness
only you could have noticed something like that
then there was the concert in ten forward
what about it
we had practised the piece and i noticed that she played it the same way during the performance every pitch every intonation was exactly the same only an artificial life form could have done that
does her husband know anything about this
i do not believe so he is on the surface monitoring the plasma infusion
probably just as well
data come take a look at this
it appears to be an information module with a holographic interface


whoever you are you must have found out about juliana
that is correct
i programmed this hologram to answer any questions you might have i am noonian soong i created her
i am data
data i hoped somehow it might be you i even created a response programme to answer your questions how are you boy
i am fine
im glad you got the chance to meet your mother
you refer to doctor tainer as my mother yet the complexity of her design indicates she was created after i was
youre right but there was a real juliana odonnell she was my wife she helped me create you
what happened to her
she was injured when the crystalline entity attacked we made it as far as terlina three but she slipped into a coma when i realised nothing could be done for her i built an android i tried to perfect my synaptic scanning technique so that i could transfer julianas memories into a positronic matrix i didnt know if it would work but i had to try i couldnt stand the thought of losing the only woman i ever loved a few days after juliana died i activated the android she looked up at me and smiled she recognised me it had worked here was a life not two minutes old and as far as she knew i was her husband shed just recovered from a terrible injury it was incredible
then you never told her the truth
why there was no reason for her to know i wanted her to be happy i wanted us to be happy we were for a while
what happened
i made a terrible mistake i never really let her know how much i loved her so she left me the real juliana probably would have left too if shed lived
if she recovers and learns that she is an android
she doesnt have to know i designed her to shut down in the event the truth was discovered when you put that chip back in she will wake up and remember nothing all you have to do is make up some excuse about what happened to her
then you do not believe she should know the truth
truth the truth is in every way that matters she is juliana soong i programmed her to terminate after a long life let her live out her days and die believing she was human dont rob her of that son please

it seems that i must make a decision whether to tell doctor tainer that she is an android or to withhold that information from her i do not know what to do
why was doctor soong so adamant that she not be told
he seemed certain that if she knew it would preclude the possibility of her being happy
data what do you think
i am not certain i understand why my father felt as he did but his wishes are not necessarily paramount i am more concerned with what would be best for her
wouldnt she be better off knowing the truth dealing with the reality of her existence
i dont think so shes believed shes human all her life the truth might be devastating to her
data there might come some time in the future when she would find out anyway another accident perhaps maybe it would be easier for her if she learned the truth from you
i can tell you that if i were in her place i would rather be told by my son than by some stranger
i find i am having difficulty separating what would be best for her from what would be best for me
what do you mean
if she knew she were an android we would have something to share i would no longer be alone in the universe
i know how much that means to you data but at the same time by telling her youre robbing her of the one thing youve wanted all your life to be human
its a difficult choice you must do what you think best data but whatever decision you make we will support it


data what happened the last thing i remember is jumping off a cliff
you were knocked unconscious by the fall you broke a bone in your arm but doctor crusher repaired it everything is fine
captains log supplemental the infusion of plasma into the core of atrea four has been accomplished the core should remain molten for several hundred years

when will i see you again
perhaps i can visit atrea on my next leave
i would like that very much well id better be going
there is something i thought you should know my father told me that he had only one great love in his life and that he regretted never telling her how much he cared for her i am certain he was referring to you
thats nice to know on atrea there is a saying that a child born from parents who love each other will have nothing but goodness in his heart i guess that explains you take care of yourself son
goodbye mother energise
parallels


personal log stardate  i am returning from the batleth competition on forcas three the conditions were difficult several contenders were maimed but i was triumphant i won champion standing i am looking forward to resuming my duties aboard the enterprise however i am anticipating a troubling situation


it looks like were going to have to head into to the argus array this is the third time this year its stopped relaying data starfleets beginning to think its more than a simple malfunction i want you to start a long range scan once we get lieutenant are you listening to me
hmm yes sir
you seem awfully tense for a man who just came back from vacation
today is my birthday

whats the matter with you
because it is my birthday i assumed that you or one of the others would try to mount an unexpected social gathering
a surprise party mister worf i hate surprise parties i would never do that to you
i am sorry commander
settle in ill meet you on the bridge
aye sir

surprise

i love surprise parties

cha worf tohgah nah lo pretok cha worf tohgah nah lo pretok cha worf tohgah nah lo pretok tu mak dagh cha doh borak

that was not a klingon song
it wasnt easy to translate there doesnt seem to be a klingon word for jolly
its traditional for the birthday boy to cut the cake
captain picard sends his birthday wishes he was needed on the bridge

happy birthday worf
thank you

ah a painting
yes i have entered my expressionistic phase this is my interpretation of the battle of haros
the battle of haros
i think its wonderful and i know just where to put it
what are you doing

i always thought this room could use a little more colour
nice the battle of haros right

worf are you all right
yes yes i think datas painting is making me dizzy
some cake
thank you doctor

i thought the cake was chocolate
dont i wish this is from alexander he gave it me just before he left to visit your parents  thank you

what is it worf
it is a cast of alexanders forehead the ridges of a warrior
he wished he could have been here when you got back from shore leave you should have seen him worf he stayed up all night talking about how proud he was of his father
thank you for watching him while i was away
oh it was my pleasure
so how old are you mister worf
captain i was told you could not attend
 i wouldnt miss this for the world how old are you
i am old enough


report
the array appears to be functioning normally sir
that cant be right we were told the array stopped relaying data six days ago
the array is still transmitting data sir but it is no longer sending that information to the federation it appears someone has redirected its imaging systems
where is the information being sent now
sector one nine six five eight sir i am unable to access its main computer so it is impossible to determine the exact location
whats in that sector
it is uninhabited but there could be a ship or a subspace relay station receiving the data
captain i suggest we beam a repair crew aboard the array we can begin downloading their imaging logs find out what the arrays been observing for the past six days
make it so
mister data

excuse me counsellor do you have a moment
of course
i have been meaning to speak with you about alexander
oh
it has never been easy for me having alexander on board i have always tried to be a good father to give him guidance but he seems to have his own mind about some things
most children do
i could not have come this far without your help alexander looks up to you at times i have felt that you are like a mother to him
worf thats one of the nicest things anyones ever said to me
one time when i thought i was going to die i asked you to watch over alexander i was wondering if you might consider formalising that arrangement i want you to be alexanders sohchim
his sohchim
you would become his surrogate mother in case anything ever happened to me you would be responsible for him
i dont know what to say its a great honour so that would make me your
the closest analogy is stepsister
that would make my mother your stepmother
i had not considered that it is a risk i am willing to take
i accept
lieutenant worf please report to engineering
i am on my way

we have analysed the imaging logs it appears the array was reprogrammed to observe several federation sites
this is deep space five starbase forty seven the iadara colony and the utopia planitia shipyards
theyre responsible for new starship development
someone is using the array for covert surveillance of the federation
that is our theory we believe unauthorised access was made six days ago the imaging logs from that day show a ship approaching the array
thats a cardassian ship galor class
were only three light years from cardassian space they would have easy access to the array
mister worf start a long range scan of the region see if there are any cardassian ships nearby
aye sir
worf heres a propulsion analysis of the cardassian ship you might try scanning for its energy configuration

lieutenant are you all right
i feel dizzy

worf you dont look so good maybe you ought to go to sickbay
yes yes perhaps i will

any nausea or blurred vision
no however i did experience some dizziness earlier today at my birthday celebration
sounds like youre having some of the side effects from the concussion i can give you some vertazine for the dizziness but id like you to rest
doctor perhaps you are thinking of another patient i have no concussion
worf you came in here this morning complaining of ringing in your ears i scanned you you had a concussion you dont remember any of this
no
temporary memory loss is common for this kind of injury do you remember telling me about the batleth tournament you said that one of the competitors hit you over the head thats why you lost the match
i won that tournament and i can prove it to you


whats wrong
it says ninth place this is not the same trophy someone is playing a trick on me
worf try to stay calm memory loss can be very disorienting
the log i recorded a personal log on my way back to the enterprise computer access personal logs on shuttlecraft curie show my log entry for stardate 
personal log stardate  i am returning from the batleth competition on forcas three the conditions were difficult several contenders were maimed one of the contenders used an illegal tgha manoeuvre against me the judges chose to ignore it and i was robbed of my rightful standing i was awarded ninth place i am looking forward to resuming my duties aboard the en
i do not understand
worf im sure this is very disturbing for you but dont worry your memories will return the best thing you could do right now is to settle back into your normal routine but slowly
thank you doctor
let me know if you have any more problems with dizziness ill give you a hypospray

lieutenant have you completed the metallurgical scan of the array
sir
the metallurgical scan have you completed it
i do not remember you asking me to captain there is a cardassian ship approaching galor class
open a channel
on screen
this is captain jeanluc picard of the starship enterprise you are in federation territory please explain your presence here
we were wondering the same thing about you captain why would starfleets flagship want to venture so close to the cardassian border
we are repairing one of our subspace telescopes
i see may we offer our assistance
no thank you everything is under control
if you dont mind my asking what exactly is this telescope of yours designed to do
its a long range subspace array we use it for gathering data on astronomical phenomena
im certain it would never be used to observe a neighbouring species
certainly not
well then best of luck with your repairs just try to make certain that your studies are limited to astronomical phenomena

charming fellow
captain that ship was responsible for reprogramming the array
what are you saying
it is the same class and energy configuration as the ship we saw in the imaging logs
the imaging logs are you suggesting that you have evidence the cardassians have tampered with the array
they are using the array as a surveillance device you saw the logs yourself
i havent heard anything about this
neither have i
commander data show them the logs you downloaded from the array
i know of no such logs
mister worf are you feeling all right
yes
mister data perhaps you had better reexamine the array see if you can find any evidence to support mister worfs claims

doctor crusher says i am experiencing further memory loss but my instincts tell me it is more than that i remember those imaging logs i could tell you every detail every word
 worf lets assume for a second youre right that things did happen as you remember them are you saying that everyones memory on this ship has been altered but yours

enter
counsellor worf i wanted you to know that we reexamined the imaging logs they dont show a cardassian ship or any evidence that the array was reprogrammed from what we can tell the array suffered a simple mechanical failure
that is not right i was certain that

whats wrong
counsellor the painting that commander data gave me it has moved
worf i hung that painting there at your birthday party remember
no

the painting has changed dont you see it

your hair and your clothing they have changed as well
worf maybe you should come with me to sickbay and


now mister worf now
what are you waiting for raise the shields

this panel configuration has been altered i do not know how

direct hit engineering section and deck forty two shield generators are overloading

number one
 firing photon torpedoes full spread
direct hit on their main reactor theyre returning fire

captain we have sustained heavy damage to the deflector systems hull breaches on decks seventeen and thirty six
ensign take us out of here maximum warp
aye sir
are they pursuing us
no sir they are firing on the argus array they destroyed it sir
bridge to engineering mister la forge whats your status
this is ensign hayes sir commander la forge has been taken to sickbay with plasma burns theres serious damage to the secondary plasma conduit but i think weve got it under control
acknowledged ensign lay in a course to starbase one two nine
aye sir
what happened back there lieutenant
i believe i experienced another memory loss
memory loss what are you talking about
i do not feel well request to be temporarily relieved of duty sir
granted


computer access personal logs on shuttlecraft curie play log entry for stardate 
there is no log entry from the shuttlecraft curie for that stardate
computer display any log entries regarding the batleth tournament on forcas three
personal log stardate  there has been a malfunction in the ships main deflector it will require two more days of repairs as a result i will not be able to compete in the batleth tournament on forcas three i have asked my brother to take my place he does not have my prowess with the blade but

whyd you lock the door
why shouldnt i
i heard what happened on the bridge are you all right
i am not sure
do you want to talk about it
i would rather not counsellor
very well lieutenant hot chocolate
is there something i can do for you
actually there is

come and sit down i just want you to relax for a minute  there  you are so tense now i know you dont want to talk about what happened on the bridge but there are times when its just best to let things out come on if you cant talk to me who can you talk to

i do not believe this is appropriate behaviour
even for your wife
wife
worf whats wrong
i do not know things are changing
whats changed
i do not remember us you and i being mates it is as if events circumstances continue to change from moment to moment but i am the only one who seems to be aware of it
are you saying you dont remember the last three years you dont remember us falling in love and getting married
i do remember the last three years but they were different we did not have this relationship we were friends and the enterprise did not have a battle with the cardassians and no one believes me
whatevers wrong whatever happened i want you to know that i believe you and that i love you and together well find out whats happening

i am initiating a subspace scan to search for temporal anomalies on or off the ship
counsellor troi please report to sickbay
im on my way let me know if you find anything
commander how long have i been married to counsellor troi
 two years one month and twelve days
and when did this relationship begin
it is my understanding your romantic affiliation began shortly after you recovered from your spinal injury on stardate  it was six months later that you asked commander riker for his formal permission to court counsellor troi you felt to do otherwise would be dishonourable
and then we mated
i am not privy to the exact details of when where or how your first coupling took place i could investigate it
no that is all right
i am detecting no temporal anomalies in this system perhaps we should try to pinpoint the exact moment when events became discontinuous do you remember the first change
i was in sickbay doctor crusher told me i had a concussion but i do not remember that happening
think back are you sure that was the very first change
before yes yes i was in engineering i felt a wave of dizziness and when i looked up you and commander la forge were on the opposite side of the room captain picard was gone i thought i had blacked out for a moment and had not observed your movements and at my birthday party the cake was chocolate and then it was yellow and commander riker told me captain picard was not going to attend and then suddenly he was there
we should try to find the commonalties in these events where were the people you were with
everyone was at my birthday party then i was with counsellor troi then commander la forge came in geordi geordi was present at all three locations and he was near me in each case just before i noticed the differences there has to be a connection
it is possible we should speak to commander la forge

doctor is geordi well enough to answer some questions
 geordis dead
there do not appear to be any unusual readings energy residuals from the plasma burns the beginnings of cellular decomposition i see nothing that connects these bioreadings to your recent sense of discontinuity
what about his visor
i still see nothing unusual perhaps we should activate it
hook it up to the diagnostic array and ill check it out
the visor is active

worf are you alright
 have you noticed another discontinuity
doctor crusher was not here doctor ogawa was
doctor ogawa
my uniform has changed what is my rank and position
youre a commander and first officer
are we still married
yes
i am detecting a quantum flux in your cellular rna
what does that mean
i do not know i will have to analyse these readings


i have found the quantum flux in worfs cellular rna extends to the subatomic level it is asynchronous with normal matter in essence captain mister worf does not belong in our universe
what
all matter in the universe resonates on a quantum level with a unique signature that signature is constant it cannot be changed through any known process it is the basic foundation of existence
are you saying that worfs quantum signature is different from ours
yes sir i cannot explain it it is as if he originates from a different quantum universe
mister worf you say the discontinuities started to occur after you returned from a batleth tournament on forcas three
yes sir
now i know for a fact that you never attended that tournament and that no shuttlecraft has left the enterprise for over a month
i understand that but i also clearly remember attending the tournament and returning to the ship in a shuttlecraft
do you remember the route you took to return
yes
lets backtrack that course see if there are any unusual readings or anomalies
aye sir

if i may inquire sir how long have you been captain of the enterprise
four years ever since captain picard was killed in the incident with the borg you dont remember any of this do you
i do remember i just remember differently


captain im picking up a minor subspace disturbance off the port bow
full stop
 aye sir
analysis mister data
it appears to be a quantum fissure in the spacetime continuum
on screen
the anomaly cannot be seen but i believe i can enhance it with a warp field to make it visible

is it dangerous
not from this distance sir i am also detecting an ion trail intersecting the phenomenon i believe it was left by a starfleet type six shuttlecraft
so i was here
i have an explanation sir

i believe the quantum fissure we discovered is a fixed point across the space time continuum a keyhole which intersects many other quantum realities
what do you mean quantum realities
for any event there is an infinite number of possible outcomes our choices determine which outcomes will follow but there is a theory in quantum physics that all possibilities that can happen do happen in alternate quantum realities
and somehow i have been shifting from one reality to another
that is correct
how did this happen
when worfs shuttlecraft came into contact with the quantum fissure i believe its warp engines caused a small break in the barriers between quantum realties worf was thrown into a state of quantum flux he immediately shifted into other realities
and geordis visor somehow triggered that effect
exactly the visor uses a subspace field pulse i believe that whenever geordi came near worf the field pulse intensified the quantum flux and pushed worf into another reality
how can we find my original quantum state and return me to it
we could scan the quantum fissure using a subspace differential pulse maybe we could locate the quantum state that shares worfs signature and find a way to get him back
an excellent idea lieutenant


worf from what i understand theres a good chance my worf wont return i guess its just hard for me to accept that theres a reality out there where you never loved me
deanna i have always considered you a close friend and although i have never seriously considered a romantic relationship i would not be opposed to the possibility
what about our children
children
you didnt know
when the last shift occurred in sickbay we did not have any children
we have a little girl shannara shes two years old and a three year old boy eric christopher
what about alexander
alexander
he was my son in another reality

ive used a differential pulse to analyze over ten million quantum states within the fissure but i still havent found one with your signature this may take some time sir
captain a bajoran ship is approaching
red alert
sir the bajorans
ever since the bajorans overpowered the cardassian empire theyve become more and more aggressive
yesterday they destroyed one of our subspace telescopes because they thought we were using it to spy on them
theyre charging their weapons sir
shields
return fire
theyve damaged our power systems sir its caused an energy surge within the subspace pulse the quantum fissure is beginning to destabilise
can we disengage the pulse
too late sir

what the hell is happening
the barriers between quantum realties are breaking down other realties are emerging into our own

and thick and fast they came at last and more and more and more

the bajoran ship is disengaging sir
the rate of quantum incursions is increasing exponentially at this rate the sector will be completely filled with enterprises within three days
captain were receiving two hundred eighty five thousand hails
i wish i knew what to tell them mister data can we stop these incursions
perhaps if we can find the ship which that commander worfs quantum signature
how would that help
it was worfs shuttlecraft which traversed the fissure and weakened the barriers between quantum realities if he reenters the fissure in his original shuttle and emits a broad spectrum warp field it may be enough to seal the fissure and stop additional realities from emerging into our own
what then how do we get the enterprises that are already here back to where they belong
in theory the act of sealing the fissure should restore the barriers between quantum states the ships would return to their own realities
lieutenant crusher send a general hail all ships
aye sir
this is captain riker of the enterprise that is the enterprise which is indigenous to this universe weve all encountered a quantum anomaly we think we have found a way to return all of us to our proper realities but we need to find that ship which exhibits a certain quantum signature our mister data will transmit that signature to you now

anything
theres too much comm traffic sir its tough to isolate whos talking to who wait a minute here it is someones responding
on screen
captain it would that we have found the quantum signature you are looking for
data believes that by sending worf back through the fissure again it would return us all to our proper realities
our data has said the same thing
we need you to send us your shuttlecraft curie
were launching it now
thank you its good to see you again captain its been a long time


did they send the right shuttle
yes sir it matches commander worfs quantum signature precisely i have remodulated the shuttles engines to emit an inverse warp field you will need to activate the field at the precise moment you enter the fissure
assuming it works will i find myself near my own ship
that is one possibility however the uncertainty principle dictates that time is a variable in this equation you may end up several days before the event or several days after there is no way to tell
i understand
good luck


setting course for the fissure
acknowledged

captain the shuttlecraft is under attack
the bajorans again
no sir its one of the enterprises theyre hailing us
on screen

we wont go back you dont know what its like in our universe the federations gone the borg is everywhere were one of the last ships left please youve got to help us
im sorry theres no choice if this works everything will return to
no we wont go back

sir theyre firing on the shuttlecraft
open fire try to disable them
direct hit their shields have collapsed their engine core is overloading

what happened
it looks like the ship had already taken heavy damage their warp containment field must have been weak
probably from fighting with the borg
captain worf is entering the fissure

charging primary systems initiating inverse warp field

worf to enterprise
enterprise here
captain is everything all right
yes lieutenant is there a problem
no i do not believe so but i will explain when i arrive
how was the batleth tournament

it was fine sir i won champion standing

so you think this quantum fissure is nothing that we need to worry about
no no i believe the inverse warp field resealed it
im looking forward to reading your report

something wrong
i know what you are planning sir i will not be surprised
surprised i dont know what youre talking about
of course you dont


 welcome home worf  i hope you dont mind i let myself in i promised alexander id feed his dalvin hissing beetle while you were both away
so you do not live here
whats that supposed to mean
it is a long story
happy birthday worf will wanted to give you a surprise party but i knew youd hate it so i talked him out of it
thank you
i know klingons like to be alone on their birthdays im sure you have to meditate or hit yourself with a pain stick or something
deanna you do not have to leave
oh
i have not had dinner would you care to join me
id love to
champagne
the pegasus



i dont know why we have to do this every year i thought that last year the teachers had agreed that they wouldnt do this anymore
captain picard day is one of the childrens favourite school activities they look forward to it all year
why does it have to be me
because youre the captain and they look up to you youre a role model for them
well they seem to have a somewhat exaggerated impression of me
 i dont know i think the resemblance is rather striking wouldnt you agree number one
isnt there something else you have to do
ill be on the bridge

will

the finalists will be here in half an hour you have to pick a first second and third place and four honourable mentions
worf to captain incoming transmission from admiral blackwell it is coded priority one
put it through mister worf excuse me counsellor

yes admiral
 captain what is your status
we are conducting energy output studies of the mekoria quasar all systems normal the ship is fully operational
good im postponing the quasar study for the moment the enterprise is to rendezvous with the starship crazy horse in sector one six zero seven immediately youre authorised to exceed warp speed limitations for the duration of this assignment
i understand what is our assignment
id prefer not to discuss it over subspace channels the crazy horse will be carrying someone from starfleet intelligence hell brief you when he arrives
very well
captain picard day
oh er yes its er its for the children im er ha ha im a role model
im sure you are starfleet out

so who won the contest
paul menegay a seven year old he did a most interesting clay sculpture of my head
was that the orange one with the lumpy skin
yes oh youll be interested to know that ive arranged for a commander riker day next month im even considering making an entry myself
great

energise
aye sir
will ill bet you never thought youd see me again

its good to see you sir
yeah sure it is you look like youre about to faint
no its just its been a long time captain jeanluc picard admiral erik pressman
pressman yes of course you were wills first commanding officer on the pegasus
thats right as a matter of fact the pegasus is the reason im here
sir
the pegasus is still out there will and the romulans found her

as you know the starship pegasus was lost in this sector some twelve years ago along with most of its crew i was the captain and commander riker here was my helmsman
i remember hearing about it the ship was destroyed by a warp core breach as i recall
the captain and i along with seven others managed to get to the escape pod before the breach became critical
from space we saw what appeared to be a matterantimatter explosion which vaporised the ship
no wreckage was found so starfleet officially declared the ship destroyed
however all that changed three days ago starfleet intelligence has an operative in romulan high command he sent us a message that a romulan warbird had located a piece of debris in the devolin system which was positively identified as being from the pegasus the warbird was then ordered to locate the rest of the ship if possible and retrieve it
what would the romulans want with pieces of a twelve year old starship
the pegasus was a prototype experimental engine new weapon systems in fact some of our designs were used in constructing the enterprise there are a lot of things on board the romulans would love to get their hands on
what are our orders
to find the ship before the romulans do salvage it if possible destroy it if necessary you command the enterprise while i remain in command of the overall mission
well need metallurgical and chromographic specs on the pegasus in order to set up the proper search parameters
ill make the appropriate information available to you
very well lay in a course for the devolin system
aye sir

captain we are approaching the devolin system
any sign of the romulans
no sir
oh theyre out there theyre just waiting to see what youre going to do
mister la forge
theres an awful lot of ionising radiation in this system captain that and the sheer amount of rock is going to slow down our search a little
how slow
id say at least
sir romulan warbird decloaking directly ahead
they are powering weapons
shields up red alert prepare phasers
sir they are hailing us
on screen
i am commander sirol of the romulan vessel terix to whom do i have the honour of speaking
i am captain jeanluc picard of the federation starship enterprise
captain picard ive heard so much about you a pleasure to make your acquaintance i hope our sudden appearance didnt startle you
not at all but your unannounced appearance might have unfortunate consequences it would be an awful shame if your ship were damaged due to some misunderstanding
i am touched by your concern for my ship but i doubt we were ever in any danger may i ask what you are doing in this system
i might ask you the same question
we are conducting a survey of gaseous anomalies
how interesting so are we perhaps we could combine our efforts and share our findings
i doubt our objectives are compatible
perhaps youre right
this has been a most pleasant conversation but we must return to our research
then i wont keep you

sir they are moving off resuming their tachyon scans of the system
stand down red alert but keep tracking their movement lieutenant
aye sir
commander how long will it take us to search this system
at least seven days sir
and the romulans have a two day head start
then lets get to it mister data
initiating sensor sweep of grid zero one

how long have you had that beard
about four years i got tired of hearing how young i looked
what was it that lieutenant boylen used to call you
ensign babyface
you never did have much of a sense of humour
i like to think that ive lightened up a little in my old age
really
ive been known to tell a joke or two
well its about time you were always so serious on the pegasus
we went through some serious times do you really think were going to find the pegasus again
i wouldnt have come all the way out here if i didnt
what about the experiment do you think were going to find that too
maybe
i think a lot about what happened especially on that last day
so do i its not the kind of thing you just forget
do you ever wonder if we did the right thing
never what happened was a tragedy yes but it wasnt your fault and it wasnt mine what we were doing was for the good of the federation and we cant blame ourselves if the others couldnt see that
i know but maybe we went about it the wrong way
well this time we may have a chance to do it the right way if this mission is successful if we find the pegasus and the experiment we can finish what we started twelve years ago
you want to try again
its not just me will the chief of starfleet security has personally given me her assurance of complete support
admiral raner how many other people know about this
not many and its up to us to make sure it stays that way raner has given me written orders for you youll find them coded in the enterprise computer youve been instructed not to reveal the true nature of our mission to anyone else not even captain picard will dont worry it wont be like it was twelve years ago and this time no ones going to stop us
for those who care about these things the travesty that was the
enterprise series finale
takes place at some point from here on in


as a matter of fact i never met will until he reported on board at farpoint station
you chose your first officer without ever meeting him
i was looking through the records of about fifty candidates and wills was much like all the others filled with lots of dry statistics and glowing letters of recommendation that tell you nothing i was about to put it aside and look at another file and then something caught my eye there was an incident on altair three when will was first officer of the hood he refused to let captain desoto beam down during a crisis he disobeyed a direct order and he risked a general court martial because he thought he was right when i read that i knew that i had found my number one
you wanted someone with a history of disobedience
i wanted someone who would stand up to me someone who was more concerned with the safety of the ship and accomplishing the mission than with how something looked on his record to me thats one of the marks of a good officer
frankly ive always felt it was more important for an officer to trust his captains judgment in a crisis theres no time for explanations orders have to be obeyed without question or lives may be lost
i am aware of that admiral
of course you are i guess this mission has brought up some old ghosts for me you know what its like to lose a ship youre always wondering if there was something else you should have done something you missed
admiral the record regarding the loss of the pegasus is a bit vague from the moment just before you abandoned ship is there anything that you can add to the official account
im afraid not but i can tell you this twelve years ago i needed an officer that i could count on in a crisis someone who would support and obey my decisions without question someone who was willing to trust my judgment and that someone was will riker without his loyalty none of us would have survived


whats wrong
i think i busted a rib
 excuse me what were you doing
i was doing batleth moves with mister worf i jabbed when i shouldve blocked he caught me right in the side its a good thing we were using sticks instead of the real blades
its broken all right give him ten ccs of terakine for the pain
i cant believe how stupid i was
you both must have got a little carried away thats all
no it was my fault i got distracted at a crucial moment
it can happen to anyone
i knew what i was supposed to do and i didnt do it if those had real batleths i might be dead right now
there all better will its all right you made a mistake no harm done youll be better next time
yeah maybe

scan of grid one five seven is complete i am moving to grid one five eight
the romulan warship is still searching grid two seven zero
theyre sure spending a lot of time over there i wonder if they
commander i think we might have just struck paydirt theres a subspace resonance signature coming from that asteroid from the frequency variances it looks like the pattern from a federation warp core
captain picard to the bridge take us to within ten kilometres of asteroid gamma six zero one

geordis found something
theres a subspace resonance signature coming from that asteroid sir it could be the warp core of the pegasus
i think hes right i recognise some of the variance patterns
put the asteroid on the main viewscreen
i have confirmed geordis readings the resonance signature is originating from somewhere beneath the asteroids surface
beneath the surface hows that possible
this asteroid contains several deep chasms large enough for a starship to enter it is possible the pegasus drifted into the asteroids gravitational field and was pulled down into one of the fissures
sir the romulan warbird has altered course once again they are heading toward our position
they probably want to see what were so interested in over here
mister data how long will it take to determine the exact location of the pegasus
at least another six hours sir
thats too long if the romulans start searching the asteroid they could find the ship before we do
i recommend we destroy the asteroid it would take most of our photon torpedoes but it would preclude any possibility of the pegasus falling into romulan hands
our top priority is to salvage the ship commander ill consider destroying it only as a last resort
yes sir
captain could you give me a third alternative
mister data would it possible to saturate the asteroid with verteron particles that could mask the resonance signature and prevent the romulans from detecting it
in order for the deception to succeed it would have to appear to be a natural phenomenon verteron particles are artificial in nature
wait a minute we could blanket the asteroid with high levels of ionising radiation theres so much of it in the system already the romulans wont know the difference
mister data
theoretically sir it should work
if we do this we have to do it fast the romulans will be within sensor range in less than a minute
make it so mister data
aye sir initiating ionisation field pulse
when hes finished well have to move away and make it look like weve scanned the asteroid but havent find anything
lay in a course for the next search grid stand by to engage
if it works the romulans wont find anything and we can return later if it doesnt
if it doesnt work well have handed them the pegasus
ionisation pulse complete
helm one quarter impulse engage
the romulans are initiating a tachyon scan of the asteroid they have switched to their lateral sensor array beginning another scan
theyre certainly being thorough
the warbird has completed its sensor sweep
if they found the resonance signature they should be sending away teams any second
they are moving out
mister data we must convince the romulans that were still looking for the pegasus i want you to continue scanning this system
yes sir
i want to be back at this asteroid at oh eight hundred hours tomorrow plan your search pattern accordingly
aye sir
admiral would you care to join me for some late dinner
please excuse me captain but i think id better turn in early
you have the bridge number one oh and will you bring the scan analysis to my quarters when youre off watch
aye sir

initiate search of grid one six three
beginning sensor sweeps
commander i want to see you in the captains ready room
mister data you have the bridge
aye sir

what the hell is the matter with you destroy the pegasus before weve even taken a look at it
i thought it was more important that the romulans
well you were wrong we have a chance here to change the balance of power in this quadrant but we cant very well do that if we destroy the pegasus now can we
no sir
it hasnt been easy for you im sure keeping your captain and friends in the dark like this
i havent enjoyed it if thats what you mean
i hope you understand that its necessary
i understand that you think its necessary
you have changed
changed
something the captain and i were talking about to be honest im glad to see this kind of change in you will state your opinion and stand by it its a far cry from the young man who used to sit at my helm and worry about pressing the wrong button
a lot of things can change in twelve years admiral
yes they can but its important that a man changes the right things in his life not his sense of duty not his sense of loyalty
id like to think that i havent changed those things sir
i would like to think that too because those things say more about a man than the rank on his collar or the uniform he wears they define him twelve years ago a lot of older and more seasoned officers turned away from their duty but you stood up for what was right im sorry will i know the kind of man you are i know that i can count on you again

come
the scan analysis you asked for
thank you
is there something else sir
yes there is  judge advocate generals report stardate  subject inquiry into mutiny aboard uss pegasus based on testimony from captain pressman and other surviving officers the judge advocate believes there is sufficient evidence to conclude that certain members of the crew did mutiny against the captain just prior to the destruction of the pegasus mutiny on a federation starship thats shocking its unthinkable and yet youve never mentioned it
no sir
you know it wasnt easy to get this record i had to pull in quite a few favours at starfleet just to get a look at it it seems that it was classified by starfleet intelligence so not only was the pegasus carrying sensitive equipment which must be allowed to fall into romulan hands not only was there a mysterious explosion which seemed to destroy the ship but didnt but it seems there was a mutiny on board now ive read the official report of the inquiry on that mutiny but i want to know your version of what happened
i was on the bridge the ship was at yellow alert we were running some tests on the engines something went wrong there was an explosion in engineering heavy casualties in the midst of this crisis the first officer the chief of engineering and most of bridge crew mutinied against captain pressman
why
they thought he was jeopardising the ship
and you
i was seven months out of the academy my head still ringing with words like duty and honour when they turned on him i thought they were a bunch of selfserving disloyal officers so i grabbed a phaser and defended my captain two or three others joined us but it was clear by then that the mutineers had most of the crew behind them we felt a need to get off the ship there was a running firefight all the way to the escape pod about five minutes after we left the ship there was an explosion
the judge advocate also believes that the surviving officers are deliberately withholding vital information from this inquiry further investigation is recommended will there was no further investigation this report was classified and then it was quietly buried why
sir may i suggest you take this up with admiral
im taking this up with you will the judge advocate thought you were participating in a conspiracy to cover up the truth now what the hell is going on here will why did that mutiny happen why is pressman so determined to find your ship twelve years later
ive said all i can i am under direct orders from admiral pressman not to discuss this sir
very well hes an admiral im a captain i cannot force you to disobey his orders therefore i will have to remain in the dark on this mission and i will just have to trust that you will not let pressman put this ship at unnecessary risk and if i find that that trust has been misplaced then i will have to reevaluate the command structure of this ship dismissed

captain starfleet places the highest priority on the success of this mission your request for a delay is denied
margaret somethings very wrong here do you know whats going on
i know that the chief of starfleet intelligence herself is watching this one jeanluc so youd be well advised to follow pressmans orders and leave it at that starfleet out
worf to captain picard we are approaching asteroid gamma six zero one sir
on my way

mister worf where are the romulans
they are out of sensor range on the far side of the system
take us to within fifteen kilometres of the asteroid and hold that position
aye sir
mister data report
for the past several hours i have been scanning the area where we detected the resonance signature of the pegasus from the strength and polarity of the signature it would appear that most of the warp core is still intact
if were lucky the entire engineering section could be down there
but how do we get to it i wouldnt want to try to transport through that much solid rock
agreed what about a shuttle we could send it down through one of these fissures
i would recommend against it sir there may be gravimetric or magnetic fluctuations inside the asteroid which would overpower the engines of a shuttlecraft
sounds like the best solution is to take the enterprise in
into the asteroid
thats right put this fissure on the main viewer this chasm is large enough for us to manoeuvre in besides if we ever hope to salvage the pegasus were going to need a starship to do it
mister data
it is theoretically possible sir but i am unaware of any prior situations where a starship was taken so deeply inside a planetary body there may be unforeseen difficulties
admiral i dont think we can risk
ive made my decision prepare to take the enterprise in captain thats an order
mister data will you please note in the ships log that this action is being taken over my explicit objections
it is so noted sir
yellow alert
shields up inertial dampers at maximum
ensign gates plot a course into the chasm manoeuvring thrusters only
course plotted sir
take us in

we are now two kilometres beneath the surface

captain we are encountering shifts in the magnetic field density
admiral if is passage narrows to less than five hundred metres i will abort the mission you can charge me with insubordination if you wish but im not going to risk the enterprise for a salvage operation
captain i am reading a large resonance signature directly ahead

pegasus
what the hell happened
sensors show that the ship is still intact however sixty five percent of it is contained within the asteroid
it looks if half the ship materialised inside solid rock
yes sir i do not understand how this could have happened
lets keep the speculation to a minimum we have to begin the salvage operation the equipment we need was in main engineering can you scan that section of the pegasus
the starboard bulkhead of main engineering is contained within the rock face but most of its compartment is still intact
there is a hull breach in that section
if we begin a power transfer can we restore life support systems to that compartment
i believe so sir the breach can be temporarily sealed by extending our shields
see to it once youve restored life support commander riker and i will beam directly into engineering
admiral i would like to send down a complete away team
theres some very sensitive equipment over there i dont want anyone else near it
yes sir


this room was open to space for twelve years
vacuum preserved everything

i wonder how many of the crew are buried back there
were not here for a memorial service  its still intact whats the matter will dont you understand weve found it
i know i kept hoping it wouldnt be here that it had been destroyed or that it was buried in that rock back there
what the hell is that supposed to mean
it means that i cant put this off any longer right up until this moment i had the luxury of time but now ive got to make a choice and admiral im afraid my choice is this i cant let you start these experiments again it was wrong twelve years ago and it is wrong today
you had better reconsider that position commander we have a mission to accomplish and youre going to carry it out
thats all you care about starting these damn experiments again look around this room is filled with dead bodies these people died because of this thing
keep your selfrighteous comments to yourself i knew most of these people a lot longer than you did yes it was tragic but it was their fault
you dont know that neither of us knows what happened after we left
well its not hard to guess they tried to shut down an experiment they didnt understand something went wrong and it killed them
no we killed them
now that doesnt sound like the same man who grabbed a phaser and defended his captain twelve years ago
ive had twelve years to think about it and if i had it to do over again i would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them
so on reflection youd rather be a traitor than a hero
i wasnt a hero and neither were you what you did was wrong and i was wrong to support you but i was just too young and too stupid to realise it you were the captain i was the ensign i was just following orders
and if you hadnt youd be dead right now along with all the rest of them dead because you listened to a bunch of mutinous cowards who were too blinded by fear to see what i was trying to do
they were brave enough to risk their lives to stop you from violating a treaty the federation signed in good faith
that treaty has bound our hands and given the romulans a tactical advantage for the last sixty years i was simply trying to level the playing field
and now you want to try it again how many people will die this time fifty a hundred a thousand
all right you dont want to help me fine but you are still under my direct orders not to talk about what you know and i expect you to follow those orders to the letter i made you mister and i can break you just as easily do you understand me commander

picard to away team prepare to return to the ship immediately
stand by enterprise

pressman to enterprise two people and one piece of equipment to beam up

report
the romulans have destroyed the entrance to the chasm with their disruptors theyve sealed us in
sir there is an incoming message it is from the warbird
on screen
aye sir
captain you seem to be in a very unfortunate circumstance how can we help
are you responsible for this
im not sure we were conducting some geological experiments on the surface of the asteroid it is entirely possible that we accidently sealed you in if only we had known you were beneath the surface if you had shared your plans with us this might have been avoided
what do you want sirol
i dont want anything captain but i will offer to help you
how
by transporting your crew aboard my ship well take you back to romulus where after a short stay as our guests you will be returned to the federation
thank you for your generous offer i will take it under advisement
as you wish we will be continuing our research in this system for a while longer i await your decision

we cant do it if we abandon the enterprise theyll come back here and get their hands on both ships
agreed options
captain i believe we could use the phasers to cut our way out
the asteroids internal structure is highly unstable any attempt to cut through the rock could cause the entire chasm to collapse
captain i have a suggestion theres a piece of equipment in admiral pressmans quarters under guard which might get us out of here its a prototype for a federation cloaking device
you just ended your career will
thats what its all about a cloaking device in the treaty of algeron the federation specifically agreed not to develop cloaking technology
and that treaty is the biggest mistake we ever made its kept us from exploiting a vital area of defence
that treaty has kept us in peace for sixty years and as a starfleet officer youre supposed to uphold it
now thats enough im taking command of this vessel mister worf escort the captain to his quarters

i dont think anyones going to come to your defence this time
how do we use the cloak to escape from the asteroid
its more than just a cloak it changes the structure of matter in theory a ship using this device could pass through normal matter
i see why you were so eager to find it
cant you see the potential here the phasing cloak could be the greatest breakthrough in weapons research in the last fifty years
except its illegal its in violation of an agreement that the federation signed in good faith
captain i think we could adapt the cloak for the enterprise
mister data
theoretically it is possible sir but it would take several hours to study the device and determine how to link it to our systems
make it so
captains log stardate  we have been trapped inside the asteroid for over eight hours mister data and commander la forge inform me that they are nearly ready to engage the cloak

commander weve routed the impulse engines through the plasma conduits but youll have to watch the intercooler levels if they get too high well blow the entire relay system
understood

i think thats what happened twelve years ago the cloak blew out the plasma relays on the pegasus after we left the ship the plasma ignited in space and it looked as if the ship had been destroyed
so the ship drifted into this system still in a phased state and when it passed through this asteroid
the cloak failed and half the ship materialised in solid rock
la forge to bridge

the cloak is online and ready to begin phase sequencing

proceed number one
aye sir activating power systems

report
the cloak appears to be functioning normally the ships matterenergy phasing rate should be sufficient to pass through the asteroid
take us out manoeuvring thrusters only
aye sir we will reach the rock face in five seconds

we have passed through two kilometres of the asteroid now within one kilometre of the surface
were approaching the surface

we have cleared the asteroid captain the warbird is off the port bow
theyre still waiting for us to make up our minds
disengage the cloaking device commander
you cannot do that if the romulans see us decloak theyll know
theyll know the truth admiral which is what everyone will know very shortly carry out my orders 
mister worf send a message to the warbird inform them that their government will be contacted shortly about this incident
aye sir
admiral i am hereby charging you with violation of the treaty of algeron as captain of the enterprise im placing you under arrest mister worf
admiral if you will come with me
captain ill have to be placed under arrest as well  admiral
i have a lot of friends at starfleet command captain

youre going to need them


ive spoken to fleet admiral shanthi there will be a full inquiry once we reach starbase two four seven and that will probably lead to a general court martial of admiral pressman and several others at starfleet intelligence your involvement in this affair is going to be thoroughly investigated will therell be some hard questions for you to answer
i understand
you made a mistake twelve years ago but your service since then has earned you a great deal of respect but this incident may cost you some of that respect
i cant help but feel i should have come forward a long time ago
when the moment came to make a decision you made the right one you chose to tell the truth and face the consequences so long as you can still do that then you deserve to wear that uniform and i will still be proud to have you as my first officer

homeward

captains log stardate  we have arrived at boraal two in response to an emergency distress call from lieutenant worfs foster brother nikolai rozhenko he has been stationed on the planet as a cultural observer

analysis mister data
the planets atmosphere is dissipating sir intense plasmonic reactions are destroying it the stratosphere is already breaking down there are turbulent radiation storms across much of its surface i estimate that the planet will be uninhabitable in less than thirty eight hours
the distress call came in only four days ago why would doctor rozhenko have waited so long before sending it
atmospheric dissipation is a rare and essentially unpredictable event when it occurs it proceeds rapidly doctor rozhenko may not have had sufficient warning

what was that
the dissipation effect is generating plasmonic energy bursts
is there any danger to the ship
i do not believe so however we may experience intermittent system failures and power surges as a result
keep an eye on it mister worf any luck
there is still no response to our hails sir i am attempting to scan the observation post
he could be hurt maybe he cant respond
sensor interference is significant but the post appears to be intact their power grid is still functioning however i am reading no life forms within the structure
its not like him to the post
especially under these circumstances
captain i am detecting faint power emissions from a system of caverns near the post it could be a deflector shield
that cant be native to the planet the boraalans dont have anything close to that level of technology
captain request permission to lead an away team
very well but regardless of this planets immediate situation we must observe the prime directive i want to minimise the risk of contact with the inhabitants you will go alone mister worf and i want to have you surgically altered so that you could pass as a boraalan
aye sir

youre worried about nikolai arent you
yes
are the two of you close
we are brothers
you never talk much about him whats he like
nikolai is older than i we are not alike we had many disagreements when we were growing up
thats not unusual
nikolai has a mind of his own he attended starfleet academy but he was unable to follow the rules he left after one year but he has many fine qualities he is brilliant persuasive a natural leader
sounds intriguing i look forward to meeting him


what are you doing here youre not from our village who are you
 who is this
my name is worf i am a traveller
how did you survive the storms
 i would know that voice anywhere worf is it really you its good to see you youve changed a lot in four years
nikolai
yes oh worf this is my brother worf hes come to help us


but if you were able to get here the storms must have subsided
please
do you think its safe enough to return to the surface
please i must speak to my brother

nikolai what have you done
they were dying i refused to sit there safe in that observation post and watch it happen i set up a deflector shield to screen these caves from the radiation and then i brought them here
what did you tell them
they think im a boraalan i told them i was from another village far from here
at least you had that much sense
when i sent the distress call i knew the enterprise was in this sector but i wasnt sure youd be the one to come im so glad that youre here worf
nikolai there is nothing we can do for these people you have only postponed their deaths
i want to discuss that with your captain
and i am certain he will want to speak with you
friends my brother and i must go back to the surface he has provisions and will need help bringing them here well return shortly
 its too dangerous the storms can occur without warning if youre caught in one
dont worry worf is a seer he understands the nature of the storms hell know when its safe to travel
yes that is correct
our seer died when the storms first came weve been without his guidance for many weeks
let me go with you i know the terrain better than anyone and i can help
no vorin worf and i will be safe well return shortly


doctor you were fully aware that the atmospheric dissipation could not be stopped what did you hope to accomplish by assisting these people
i was trying to give them a future what i propose is we create an atmospheric shield on the planet we can camouflage the equipment just as was done with my observation post no one will ever know its there
you cant be serious
indeed i am i realise it will only provide atmosphere for a limited area on the surface but it will be enough to save one village
i have no intention of compounding what you have done by committing another gross violation of the prime directive
captain the boraalans have a rich and beautiful culture a deep spiritual life they deserve the chance to survive and isnt that what the prime directive was truly intended to do to allow cultures to survive and grow naturally
not entirely the prime directive was designed to ensure noninterference
but arent we interfering either way if we take no action its a conscious decision to let the boraalans die
exactly we have the power to save some of them all we have to do is exercise it
we are sworn to uphold the principle of the prime directive and until that is changed there is no further course of action that we can take is that understood
some of my log recorders are still in my observation post they contain most of my research since it appears that the only way im going to preserve boraalan culture is in a museum i request permission to return to the surface and retrieve them
im afraid that wont be possible but you can have full use of the ships computer to set up a comm link and upload your data from here if theres nothing further youre dismissed

im sorry nikolai i wish there were another way i am quite familiar with your communications systems if you like i will help you set up your comm link
ill do it myself

captain atmospheric dissipation has accelerated over the past several hours i estimate the planets atmosphere will be completely gone within three minutes
captain ive completed my data uplink with your permission i would like to integrate my research logs with the ships library computer
of course
the mesosphere is gone plasmonic reactions are now beginning to break down the troposphere
put it on screen

whats going on
it appears the plasmonic reactions are continuing to interfere with our sensors
i thought you had compensated for that
i had sir i will attempt to engage additional filtering elements visual reestablished
this is one of those times when we must face the ramifications of the prime directive and honour those lives which we cannot save
i find no honour in this whatsoever captain you will forgive me if i dont stay

you have the bridge number one

helm take us out of orbit set a course for starbase eighty seven warp five
aye sir

what happened
there appears to be an unusual power drain in the eps distribution net
whats the source
unknown sir it is difficult to localize
the power drain has registered on my security grid as well sir it appears to be coming from deck ten
all right mister worf get a security team on it

concentrate your scans on the eps transfer links

computer open holodeck five
unable to comply holodeck five is in use
override authorisation worf theta six one nine
unable to comply holodeck control systems have been bypassed

worf come in

what are you doing here
i have to show you something whatever you do stay quiet

look

ive done what you refused to do ive saved them

i started thinking about this days ago when it became clear the planet was doomed i knew if i could get access to your ships computer i could generate a replica of the caves the hard part was transporting the boraalans into the holodeck without anybody on the enterprise noticing but i was able to blank out the sensors and make it look like interference from the plasmonic bursts and it worked perfectly the boraalans were transported while they were sleeping they never knew anything had happened

bridge
its a simple plan really thats the beauty of it worf trust me this is going to work
trust you you never had any intention of obeying the captain
i wasnt going to let those people die just because your captain started quoting federation dogma to me
your duty was to respect the captains orders and to uphold the prime directive
duty thats all that really matters to you isnt it well i refuse to be bound by an abstraction the lives of the people of boraal are far more important to me you worry too much worf you always did everything will work out
you have disgraced yourself and you have disgraced me i want nothing more to do with you

you realise your career is finished
i know that captain and i would do it all again
what do you expect us to do now you have left us with a colony of boraalans who think theyre still on their planet
i didnt beam them up without a plan ive given this a lot of thought i think we can find a new planet an m class world that can be their new home
a home which would look very different from boraal you cant really believe that theyll be fooled
thats where the holodeck comes in ill go back and tell the boraalans were going on a journey to a different place where theyll be safe from the storms the holodeck can gradually change the terrain as we travel so that at the end the holodeck simulation will match the conditions on the new planet then well simply beam them down
what if it doesnt work what if they become aware that something strange is going on
captain i cant prepare for every contingency but i assure you im accustomed to thinking on my feet ill deal with the situation as it evolves
im not enthusiastic about this plan but i dont see that we have another option very well lets give it a try
thank you captain

there are countless m class planets in federation space which can support the boraalans we need to narrow the parameters
it will take approximately nine and one half hours to complete the analysis
even then theres no guarantee that well find a suitable planet
that is correct sir
captain youd better take a look at this
what is it
weve got a problem sir i dont think its going to be possible to keep this holodeck simulation stable
why not
the plasmonic energy surges from the planet are affecting the ships systems were having problems with the eps systems and the power distribution matrix
and as a result the holodeck imaging processor has been severely destabilised
its not a question of whether the simulation will break down its a question of when
theres no way round it
not while its running in order to fix it id have to shut down all of the holodecks and reinitialise the entire system
that will take hours
well just have to hope the simulation holds long enough
very well lets try it mister la forge i want you to monitor the situation very carefully and keep an open comm link with the holodeck so as to be apprised of any problems
aye sir
captain ill return to the holodeck as soon as my surgical alterations are completed and ill prepare the boraalans for their journey
considering the situation you have put us in i dont think its wise to leave you alone with those people mister worf will accompany you
sir perhaps someone else would be a better choice counsellor troi is familiar with
mister worf the boraalans already know you theres no need to introduce them to anyone new
aye sir

keep a close eye on your brother i dont want him making this situation worse than it is

my friends we have returned we have food this is difficult to say but you have a right to hear it by the time worf and i had reached the surface the village was gone the storms have destroyed everything there is nothing for us to return to
we cant survive in here our supplies wont last forever
thats why we must leave there is a place far from here where there are no storms it will be a difficult journey but in the end we will have a new home
i know a way through the caves we will travel safely until we return to the surface
where is this new land
as we said it is far from here it will not be like the home you knew even the stars may be different
why would they be different and how do you know well be safe there
my brother is a seer if he says well be safe you must trust that we will be safe

whats wrong
look

do not worry it is an omen
what does it mean
this is the sign of la forge it is a message to travellers it is said when these lines appear and disappear

in a pool of water the road ahead will be filled with good fortune
hang in there worf give me just a second there that should do it


you see our journey is already blessed the road ahead is long let us have a meal together then well make preparations to leave

worf very good work apparently we dont make such a bad team after all
we are not a team i am here because captain picard ordered me here
worf dont we both share the same goal arent we both trying to make this plan work
only because you forced us into it
im not ashamed of what i did im not sorry i saved their lives
you have not changed you still expect people to solve the problems you create
im not here to work out the issues of our childhood im here to save a people who i care about and if that upsets you then so be it

these are the two planets which best match our search criteria draygo four features an unusually large temperate zone however it is within three light years of cardassian space
there are constant border disputes in that sector
the alternative is vacca six it is located in the cabral sector
thats pretty isolated
it offers a less hospitable climate than the boraalans are accustomed to however it would still appear to be the better choice do you disagree doctor
no data youre right its just that the enormity of what were doing is overwhelming we are deciding the future of a species
it is a formidable responsibility
there are so many questions we dont have answers to what if the climate is so different that it affects them in a way that we cant anticipate how do we even know theyll be able to survive and if they do how will their society evolve and what impact will it have on the vaccan system we have no idea what this decision will mean to their future
doctor i do not believe we can offer any guarantees we can simply make the best choice we have at the moment
all right data vacca six it is
data to bridge
picard here
we have located a new home for the boraalans sir

it is vacca six in the cabral sector
we can reach that in forty two hours at maximum warp sir
very well helm set course for vacca six
aye sir


what is this
our chronicle the history of our village doesnt your village keep a chronicle
not in this manner
then how do you teach your children their history who their ancestors were where they come from
we tell each other stories make up songs
stories change with each person who tells them this this will always be the same our chronicle has been maintained for seventeen generations i was only able to save the last six this shows the destruction of our village this is you and nikolai leading us to safety
we must leave gather your belongings
one of the scrolls is gone i must have dropped it in the passageway ill go find it
we must stay together we will have to leave it behind
worf the chronicle is the life of our village without that past our future means nothing i must find it
go and return quickly
seer i am an old man would you help me with my gear
of course
that is tarrana my daughter i am fortunate she was old enough to survive the storms
she is a fine girl
she is a beautiful girl she has not been promised to anyone if i do not reach our new home i would like her to become your wife
you will reach your new home i promise



can i help you


all right all right its okay do you need some help its okay
all right everybody back off back off
i know things must look very strange to you but everythings going to be all right no ones going to hurt you were friends of nikolai and worf dont be afraid
nikolai
yes hes my friend that means you are too i promise i wont hurt you
please help me where am i

im sorry there is nothing i can do his neural physiology is unusual i cant wipe his memory
i see how is he
as well as can be expected ive given him a mild sedative and trois been speaking with him and he seems much calmer
does he understand the situation
i think so
contact mister worf make sure he knows whats going on
here he is now this is captain picard
vorin isnt it
why did you bring us here
your planet was dying it could no longer support life we took you away from it
but we never left the caves
we have the ability to create the illusion of other places like the caves on your planet you have actually spent the last two days here on this starship not on boraal
then our home is gone
yes
vorin listen to me we can visit many other worlds we can take you to one where you can build a new life
a new life
a chance for your culture your people to survive and grow
how can we grow when everything that made us who we are is gone


dobara you go on ahead
i will carry your pack go and join the others
thank you seer
itll be dark soon in a few hours would you ask mister la forge to create a suitable campsite for us a few kilometres from here whats wrong
vorin has left the holodeck
how did he get out
i do not know but doctor crusher cannot erase his memory
what will they do with him
they have explained the situation to him he must make his own decisions
wait are you saying that if vorin wants to come back in here theyll let him
that is right he is not a prisoner
but if he comes back here and tells the others what he has seen on the enterprise everything we have done will be for nothing
then you should have considered that before you beamed them on board but you never think about the consequences of your acts
if you mean by that that im willing to do something while others hesitate thats true
wherever you go you create chaos how many times did our parents lie awake at night wondering what kind of trouble you were in
oh if only i could have been like you worf the perfect son
i was not perfect but i was not wild and disobedient
of course not you were too busy doing your duty
i would rather be accused of that than making our mother weep but i see it is clear you have no intention of changing i see no reason to discuss it further

commander the holodeck malfunctions

are increasing
im running every stabilisation routine i know
how much longer till we reach the new planet
well be there in less than eight hours youre just going to have to hold things together a little while longer
someone is coming

may i speak with you
yes of course
i dont know what nikolai said to you but please forgive him
it is an old argument
ive never seen him like this hes usually so confident so sure of himself but now he seems different do you know why
no no i do not
ever since vorin was lost people have been afraid worried that we wont reach our new home we need nikolais strength now more than ever when the storms first came to our village many of us were ready to die but nikolai refused to let us he gathered us together and led us into caves he saved us he is a brave and compassionate man and i love him please go to him make things right between you i want us to be a family
us
yes i want you to consider yourself my brother after all youre going to be the uncle of my child

we are in synchronous orbit above the beam down site sir
good mister la forge how much longer before we can transport the boraalans
a few more hours captain but weve got some problems here

i dont think the holodecks going to last that long weve had materialisation errors and resolution failures all over the place and its getting worse the simulation could fall apart any minute

well have the transporter room standing by but we may have to transport the boraalans whether youre ready or not please keep mister worf apprised
aye sir
you have the bridge number one we still have one more problem to worry about

yes
we have arrived at the planet that i told you about have you made a decision
i believe i would like to go back to my people
i see what do you intend to tell them
i dont know
if you tell them the truth what will happen will they believe you
im not sure it is a fantastic story
perhaps they will think that you have had an hallucination or that youre insane
i dont think i would like to live my life knowing what i know and being regarded as a madman
on the other hand they may believe your fantastic story they would learn about alien worlds starships
that would be disastrous it would destroy everything they believed in i cant tell them the truth but i dont think i can live with a secret
then stay here make a future for yourself with us
i need some time please

how could you have mated with a boraalan what were you thinking
i dont owe you an explanation this is a matter between dobara and me
as usual you are thinking only of yourself
and as usual you are here to point out the error of my ways
you have treated dobara with dishonour
i have not i love her and were going to raise our child together
that is not possible i cannot allow you to stay here
you will have to kill me first

what does it mean 
the storms have returned
we will be killed
no you wont worf has the power to end the storms once and for all
yes but everyone must take shelter in the tents
the tents wont protect us
worf will protect you you must trust him hurry hurry get to your tents now
commander it might be helpful if you could produce

a storm wind lightning and thunder
ill see what i can do

get in get in the storm is getting worse stay inside worf and i will take care of you

commander energise


the storms will not return
as i said he would my brother worf has saved us all
captains log stardate  the boraalans have safely reached the site of what will eventually become their new village none of them suspects they ever left their planet however our success has come at a high price


i think it was some form of ritual suicide
he said that he had nowhere to go
he would have died even if we hadnt interfered
but he wouldnt have died alone and afraid
are you saying youre sorry we saved the boraalans
no of course not our plan for them worked out well but i wish that vorin could have bridged the gap between our two cultures i would have liked the chance to have known him better

go inside
nikolai dont
please

i told you you would have to kill me to get me away from here
i do not want to fight you nikolai
things were never easy between us were they
no
its my fault if id been more like you we wouldnt have had so many problems
no if you had been more like me these people would not be here now you gave them a chance at a new life
and i intend to share that life with them the village will need a new chronicle someone will have to begin it my child will need a father my place is here im finally taking responsibility
you were never good at drawing how will you keep a chronicle
i learn quickly
then perhaps there is hope

could i take this with me
its yours
i will have to explain all of this to mother and father
they wont understand
they may i will tell them that you are happy
sub rosa



most people on this colony will remember my grandmother as a healer but her abilities went beyond that she didnt just relieve pain and fight illness she knew that wellbeing is more than a healthy body her remedies often included words of advice as well as medicinal teas and often they were just as bitter tasting i will miss felisa howard very much her healing her advice and most of all the inspiration she has provided me throughout the years rest in peace nana
 and so now we commit her body to the ground earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust in sure and certain hope that her memory will be kept alive within us all
amen

that was a beautiful
oh thank you deanna did you notice a strange man at the service he was in his midthirties with longish hair
no
he threw a flower on nanas grave a camellia it was her favourite flower she used to keep them all over the house
maybe he was a friend or one of her patients
it was a very personal gesture and he gave me a remarkable look well i guess i should be going back to the house there are some things i need to do its only a few minutes from here would you mind coming along
id love to
thanks
how long do you plan on staying
a few more hours why
well as you know caldos is one of the first terraforming projects of the federation our weather controls and fusion systems are nearly a century old i wouldnt mind having a starship engineer take a look at them perhaps give us a few upgrades maybe in exchange for a tour of the colony and a homecooked meal
well we are due at starbase six two one tomorrow morning but we could delay for a few days yes im sure we could find the time
excellent
i would enjoy that tour caldos colony is a most impressive accomplishment i actually feel as if im in the scottish highlands
that was the intent the cornerstone of every building in town was brought from edinburgh glasgow aberdeen the founders wanted everyone to feel they had a piece of the real thing here they didnt want to just imitate scotland they wanted to recreate it
tell me governor im curious youre obviously not scots yourself what was it that drew you here
something about the culture the heritage when i was a boy my family visited glamis castle in scotland as i looked out across the highlands i felt as if i had come home


your grandmother had remarkable green eyes
every woman in the howard family has had green eyes except for my mother and me
how well do you remember your mother
very well i loved her very much i can remember her face smiling down at me and i can remember the sound of her voice and her scent but mostly i remember nana who raised me after my mother died

thats beautiful
its a family heirloom its been in the howard clan for generations its supposed to symbolise the enduring howard spirit wherever they may go the shining light to guide them through their fortune nana always kept it lit i remember sitting here listening to ghost stories with only the candle burning
you should take it with you
i think i will
im going to head back to the ship
you dont have to leave
i just thought youd like some time alone ill see you later
thanks


whos there

what the hell are you doing get out of my house
i wouldna be so high and mighty with me beverly howard crusher ive spent more time here in the past five years than ye have in the past twenty
how do you know who i am
im ned quint i took care of your grandmothers house and her affairs
nana never mentioned you
theres a lot of things she didna talk about let me get rid of that candle
why
that candle has brought nothing but misery and bad luck to your grandmother
look mister quint i dont know what your relationship was with my grandmother but this is my house now and these are my things
that candle has been a curse on your family for generations if ye have a lick of sense youll listen to me right now and do away with it now give it to me
this is a family heirloom and i intend to keep it now would you please get out of my house now
howard women always the same stubborn fools i wash my hands of it now you stay on in this house and you keep that damned candle ill not be responsible for what happens
get out

the colonys aqueduct system is functioning normally as are the communication relays
weve been having a few tremors over the past couple of months could you check the seismic stabilisers
certainly
you cant imagine what its like trying to enjoy afternoon tea while the earth is shaking
governor did you know you had a power fluctuation in your weather control system
no our weather controls been working perfectly for the last twenty two years
i cant isolate the exact source but the fluctuation seems to be originating from one of the substations that regulates atmospheric humidity for the colony
is this going to be a problem
no not yet but power distribution patterns are already off by five percent
i suggest we analyse the planets weather patterns to see if they have been affected i am reading unusually high humidity across the entire southern desert region and there is increasing cloud activity above the northern coastal area possibly the formation of a storm system
a storm its the middle of summer we dont have rain at this time of year
data lets see if we can correct this ill check out the colonys climatic flow array
i will run a diagnostic on the thermal regulators
dont worry governor well keep you dry
i certainly hope so theres a caber toss scheduled for tomorrow afternoon id hate to see it spoiled by an unexpected downpour

you wouldnt believe what ive been reading about in my grandmothers journals you know she had a lover can you believe that nana was a hundred years old
it would seem the howard women have exceptionally vigorous libidos
i certainly hope so after all i hope i can find a handsome young man in his thirties when i pass the century mark
thirties
yes according to these journals his name is ronin and hes thirty four years old they met just after my greatgrandmothers death and i think i saw him at the funeral a handsome young man tossed a camellia onto her grave but the strange thing is she never mentioned him in her letters never once and yet it appears they spent almost all their time together its as if she led an entire life that i knew nothing about
well it looks like were going to be on caldos for a few days more this will be a good opportunity to get your grandmothers affairs in order
thank you

thirties


beverly


you dreamt you were in bed with someone
not exactly i was in bed but there wasnt another person in my dream it was more like a presence
you said you felt a touch
a pair of hands they were moving across my skin
like a caress
yes and there was a voice a man he whispered my name it was as if i knew him or more like he knew me he knew exactly how i liked to be touched it was the most physical dream ive ever had the sensations were very real and extremely arousing
frankly im envious
i did fall asleep reading a particularly erotic chapter in my grandmothers journal she wrote very detailed descriptions of her experiences with ronin
well thats bound to cause a dream or two so shall we start going over the personnel reports
you know i think he had a ring on one of his hands when he touched my shoulder my neck i wonder if ill have another dream tonight
id read two chapters


you probably want to be alone ill leave
no ned its okay look im sorry we got off to a bad start yesterday ive been reading my grandmothers journals and i know how much you meant to her
aye she was a grand lady youll not see many more like her you have your grandmothers fire thats for sure
ned youre welcome to stay at the house after ive gone i need someone to take care of the place
thats verra kind of you lass but ill neer set foot in that house again and i recommend that you dinna either
why
like i tried to tell your grandmother the hoose is haunted
haunted
you believe what you want lass just dinna light that candle
why not
itll bring the ghost its his home oh hes out now wanderin across the land angry angry at being driven out thats why hes bringing the storms
ned the weather systems control is malfunctioning the enterprise is trying to repair it
oh sure but who do you think is causing the malfunction
i think your imagination is
think what you want see what you want just do as i say dinna light that candle or dinna go to that hoose or before you know it theyll be burying another howard in this cemetery


captain i am detecting atmospheric turbulence over the colony and large pockets of electrical activity
on screen
it is growing in intensity sir
thats one hell of a thunderstorm
bridge to engineering mister data were reading

an extremely large storm system over the caldos colony

i thought that the weather control malfunction was not severe

it began as a minor power fluctuation sir but the effect has spread throughout the control grid it has caused an unusual concentration of cumulonimbus activity above the colony
captain i suggest we set up a power transfer between the enterprise and the weather substations try to give them enough power to stabilise the storm
make it so


whos there ned is that you hello i know somebodys here so i suggest you

all right now thats it if you dont show yourself right now i am calling the enterprise and there will be ten security guards here within thirty seconds
beverly beverly ive come back for you
who are you
dont you remember i came to you last night while you were asleep
no that was a dream im calling the enterprise

now do you remember me
yes whats whats happening to me right now i feel so strange
i love you beverly just as i loved felisa before you
are you ronin
yes you saw me at the funeral

who are you
im a spirit
i dont believe in
ghosts nor did i in the beginning i was born in sixteen forty seven in glasgow on earth
youre telling me that youre an eight hundred year old ghost
i found a home with jessel howard she was a pretty lass with a mane of red hair and eyes like diamonds i loved her very much when she died i stayed with her daughter and her daughter and on down through the years generation after generation
and now youre here on caldos two hundred light years away
when your family moved out into the galaxy i moved with them
i dont believe you
i believe you are the most beautiful women i have ever known
whats whats happening to me
were becoming one beverly were going to be together
i dont understand stop it


come in
hi bev i just wanted to see if you were going to mokbara class this morning
no i think ill skip it today im exhausted
did you have another dream last night
not exactly
is anything wrong
not at all
beverly if i didnt know any better id say you were seeing someone
deanna
now i know youre seeing someone
im not seeing anybody i met someone thats all
well you obviously have romantic feelings for him beverly when are you going to realise that you cant fool me who is it
all right i met ronin
ronin your grandmothers lover
hes unlike anyone ive ever met before i know this sounds crazy but i have never known anyone who was so
passionate
exactly i can see why nana fell in love with him this sounds very strange doesnt it
i admit its unusual im very happy for you but i want you to consider something you and ronin have both suffered a tremendous loss very often shared traumatic experience can create the illusion of closeness and romance
thank you for your concern but i think i know what im doing besides i didnt say i was in love with him im just intrigued

you know captain i moved to this colony because it was a recreation of scotland but i must admit its getting to be a little too realistic



what the hell is going on
there appears to be a condensed suspension of water vapour approximately one degree celsius
fog
it just sort of rolled in on us sir
there has been a malfunction in the ships environmental control
weve traced the problem to the power transfer beam theres some sort of feedback coming from one of the colonys weather substations
another power fluctuation
captain the temperature in ten forward has dropped to below freezing and deck thirteen has lost gravity
mister data disengage the power transfer
i am unable to terminate the connection sir a feedback loop has formed in the transfer beam i will have to go to the substation and attempt to correct the problem from there
make it so

in the meantime i think ill go get my jacket

i have analysed the control module in the primary weather control grid it appears the station is experiencing a system wide power failure
this is impossible the back up systems should have

excuse me sir you are dismantling the primary power conduit i must ask you to stop
no  get away from me you dinna understand hes trying to kill us all

he is dead

from what i can tell he was trying to shut down the entire weather control system he was pulling out the primary plasma conduit thats probably what caused the plasma discharge that killed him
i knew ned quint he was an honest man he mostly kept to himself i dont know why hed try something like that
its going to take us some time to get the system back online id say we need another day at least
in the meantime governor you should expect the weather problems to continue
i think youd better take a look at this

data you said there was a plasma discharge from the console when quint was killed
that is correct
well that wasnt what killed him im detecting an anomalous energy residual throughout his body right down to the cellular level whatever it is it wasnt the result of a plasma discharge

anything
i cannot identify the energy residual however it appears to have the same anaphasic signature as the power fluctuations we observed from the weather control system
then its possible that whatever caused the weather malfunctions also killed quint
it is possible
we should scan the colony for any energy readings that match this anaphasic signature
governor with your permission id like to take the body back to the ship to run further tests
of course doctor
ensign ask doctor selar run a biospectral analysis
yes doctor
youre not going to run the tests yourself
no i have some things i need to attend to

ronin ive got to talk to you are you here
im here beverly did you miss me
yes but i must talk to you theres been an accident
i know quint is dead
why did it happen what was he doing
beverly theres something more important we should talk about
ronin ive got to know quints dead

ronin
yes i need you to help me
help you
its not easy for me to take corporeal form i cant do it for long i want you to light the candle
quint said you lived in the candle is that true
yes if im away from it for too long i begin to weaken thats why the women in your family have always kept the candle lit
the candles on the ship ill go get it
no i must go with you
how
the power transfer beam i can travel along it
and when the candles lit then what happens
then well be together always


computer secure door

i lit the candle where are you
its all right were together were going to be one im going to become part of you beverly would you like that
oh yes more than anything
as it was with your grandmother and your greatgrandmother and all of the howard women before them ill take care of you and you will feel love as youve never felt it before



beverly what the hell is this
i thought it was pretty selfexplanatory im leaving starfleet energize
belay that order
aye sir
beverly you cant just resign
i can and i have ive decided to stay on caldos and become a healer like my grandmother its a proud howard tradition and ive decided to uphold it energise ive resigned my commission so unless you plan on kidnapping me


beverly was attracted to ronin in a very intense and intimate way i warned her that it was all very sudden but she didnt want to talk about it so i let her alone i sensed that she was holding something back that she wasnt telling me the whole truth
do you think this ronin could be exerting some sort of influence over her that its because of him that shes staying
its possible but she may really believe shes in love with him
this is a rash decision ill considered its not like beverly at all
i agree but she does have the right to make that choice even if we dont feel its a good one

come
captain geordi and i have detected an energy residual with the same anaphasic signature as the one we found on ned quints body
where
approximately seventeen kilometres from the centre of the colony sir it is coming from the cemetery
data i want you to go down to the cemetery see if you can pinpoint the source
aye sir

in the meantime i would like to meet with this ronin


the energy readings are coming from this direction but i cant get an exact location ill try narrowing the scan field
the energy readings appear to be originating approximately two metres below the surface i believe they are concentrated within this burial site


im so glad youre here i cant imagine what life was like before i met you
and it will only get better

oh ronin i had no idea i could feel this way
were nearly merged now as two candles join to form a single light so we will flourish as one

i love you beverly
i love you

beverly
jeanluc
sorry i startled you i knocked but there was no answer the door was open i hope you dont mind
what do you want
well id hoped to meet your new friend ronin
hes not here
well perhaps i could wait if you dont mind im really anxious to meet this remarkable young man who swept away not just one but two of the howard women
 jealousy doesnt suit you jeanluc
have you changed the colour of your eyes
i just grew tired of the other colour dont you think it suits me
i think that i preferred your eyes the way they were before i think i preferred you the way you were before beverly
well this is the way i am now and this is my life ive made my decision and im not going to change my mind so please leave me alone
oh no theres somethings wrong here now beverly this is more than just an obsessive love affair that has got out of hand tell me why is it that no one has seen this ronin except you
 all right captain here i am i believe beverly asked you to leave her alone

so youre ronin its a pleasure to meet you where are you from
earth scotland
how long have you been on caldos
all that matters is that im here now and that beverly and i plan to be together for the rest our lives
data to picard
go ahead data
captain we have located the source of the energy residual it appears to be concentrated within felisa howards coffin
captain wed like permission to exhume the body
you cant do that leave her alone
why not what are you afraid of
im not afraid of anything but i cannot allow you to desecrate her grave
data ask governor maturins permission to exhume the body picard out
i wont stand for this ill go to the governor myself
go on i wouldnt be surprised if he doesnt know who you are hell probably have the same questions that i do how did you get here what ship did you come on
jeanluc leave him alone
why dont you answer my questions what ship id like to look at the passenger list where have you been living here whats your position who are your neighbours

come on beverly weve got to get out of here

jeanluc

beverly we must stop the others they cannot exhume the body
we cant just leave him he might die
you must come i am your love i am the one who will take care of you
i cant just let him die
beverly come with me
no no
im sorry im going to stop them

come on come on
im all right beverly go after him go to the cemetery

la forge to enterprise were ready down here
aye sir

i am reading definite signs of anaphasic energy in her body it appears to extend to the cellular level
thats impossible she wasnt anywhere near the weather station when quint was killed she died of natural causes
i suggest we run a deep tissue scan to look for any signs of

no ronin stop this stop this please
beverly its all right have trust in me
youre not nana nanas dead leave her alone

beverly forgive me these men were trying to stop us from being together once theyre gone everything will be right
no it wont youve been infusing me with the same sort of anaphasic energy that killed quint
he was trying to destroy me i had to defend myself my love i could never harm you i am here to protect you
no youre not theres no such thing as a ghost you are some sort of anaphasic lifeform anaphasic energy is extremely unstable it needs an organic host in order to maintain molecular cohesion or else youll die isnt that right
beverly
i also scanned the candle the flame is plasma based you were using it as a receptacle for yourself in order to get to me in order to merge with me you have been using me nana my entire family for centuries
and i loved all of them and they loved me give me the candle beverly
no no

put it down or i will kill him set it down and walk away

no
 crusher to riker will close off all the plasma conduits in the weather control system ill explain later
understood
youve nowhere left to go
yes i do
keep away from me

beverly i love you beverly

captains log supplemental commander la forge and mister data have recovered from their exposure to the anaphasic energy but im afraid doctor crushers recovery will be of a more personal nature

somehow he realised that one of my ancestors had a biochemistry that was compatible with his energy matrix i imagine that he took human form and seduced her like he did me i was about to be initiated into a very unusual relationship you might call it a family tradition but theres a part of me thats a little sad
how so
i reread the entries in my grandmothers journals whatever else he might have done he made her very happy
lower decks



fletcher has more experience with propulsion systems
but carstairs is better with people considering this is a supervisory position id go with her
i guess youre right didnt we just do crew evaluation reports
three months ago
it seems like three weeks why dont we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night commander
fine with me captain
could we have two coffees please

 what could be so funny whats so funny about crew evaluations
dont worry about it sam
 cant we just try and have a good time here
how can i have a good time when my careers being decided across the room come on think promotion promotion promotion
 you cant really believe that what you are doing will influence the outcome of your evaluation

promotion promotion promotion
its a timehonoured strategy taurik
the vedeks of the janalan order maintain a round the clock chant for the benefit of the bajoran people
considering the history of your planet that doesnt exactly validate what hes doing
promote me please so i can make lieutenant and have my own room
if youre unhappy sharing quarters with me then you should put in for a new room assignment just in case youre not promoted

ive been thinking about who to promote to ops
the new night duty officer
lavelle is an obvious candidate but im also considering ensign sito
thank you
youre welcome are you sure about dessert
yes dont tempt me

so are they working on crew evaluations
yep
who are they talking about
its not my place to say
come on ben
please
all right but im not sure you two are going to like it apparently you two are up for the same job

lock phasers on target
phasers locked
the enemy is firing
helm hard to starboard
hard to starboard
fire phasers

firing
target is destroyed
end simulation sequence secure from drill alpha shift your response time was seven percent slower than the gamma shift all departments submit drill evaluation reports

by oh nine hundred hours
ensign youll write that report
yes sir

what happened back there ensign
im sorry sir when we changed course i had to relock phasers before i could fire
next time try letting the locking relay float until the actual order to fire is given they may not teach that trick at the academy but it works
thank you sir
lavelle
sir
resume previous course and speed
aye aye sir
one aye is sufficient acknowledgment ensign

helm change course for the argaya system maximum warp
aye sir
what happened to the rendezvous with the clement
ive just received new orders from starfleet well discuss it in the observation lounge mister data mister worf
ensign sito take over at ops
yes sir

the argaya systems close to the cardassian border i wonder why were going there howd you like to be a spider under that table
what
a spider under the table
is that like a fly on the wall
i guess so you did really well during the drill
well apparently commander riker didnt think so i swear hes got it in for me
youre imagining things
yeah then how come youre sitting in that chair instead of me
i guess he figured i need more practice than you do

excuse me sir do you have a minute
sure taurik what is it
id like you to take a look at something
have you been improvising again ensign
in a manner of speaking im running a computer simulation to test a new warp field configuration
youve got a problem here your plasma flow to the nacelles is out of sync
actually sir that was done deliberately as you can see this configuration has increased overall warp field integrity by seven percent
youre right
doctor nils diaz has been experimenting with this technique at the tanaline propulsion laboratory
yeah im familiar with his work but i never heard anything about this
his findings have not been released yet i was able to review a preliminary report when i was at the academy
i look forward to reading about it
i predict that when these findings are made public they will become a new model for warp field operation
sounds interesting
with your permission sir id like to begin tests to see if the technique can be adapted to our warp drive
there might be variables that you didnt account for
i was quite thorough
im sure you were but id still need to see your simulation before i authorise any tests
as you wish
if you have any other ideas for increasing efficiency dont hesitate to run them by me
as a matter of fact sir i do when would be a good time to discuss them
ill get back to you on that

excuse me doctor
if youre wondering about the evaluations things couldnt be better
actually i just wanted to tell you that ensign reillys condition is showing improvement but thank you
in fact im recommending you for a promotion how does lieutenant alyssa ogawa sound
it sounds wonderful
ill talk to commander riker and im sure itll be official as soon as the current crew evaluations are over oh alyssa how are things going between you and lieutenant powell
fine i think
you think
im sure its nothing but he seems preoccupied lately last night he had to cancel our date
i see
hes been putting together a research proposal hes been really busy with it
i know what thats like sometimes i get so busy with research i forget to eat
i just wonder
what sit down
ive never met anyone like andrew its as though weve known each other forever
you do seem very well suited
but i know that in the beginning of a romance its possible to be a little blind
im not sure i know what you mean
well cancelling a date like that the way hes been so distant lately doctor do you think those could be warning signs that hes losing interest
alyssa i think youre overreacting
maybe so
if i cared as much about someone as much as you care about andrew hed have to do a lot more than cancel a date before id get suspicious
youre right
im sure that when this research is over things will be back just the way they were
except of course that hell have to deal with lieutenant ogawa


i only filled in at ops for a half hour but i had to degauss the main deflector dish recalibrate the navigation grid and use internal sensors to find a lost puppy
ops is a very different challenge from tactical
i cant figure out why im even being considered for this assignment im a security officer
i recommended you
ill try not to let you down sir

what could they be talking about
have you ever considered learning to lip read
you think worfs chewing her out
no he always looks like that
maybe hes giving her pointers on how to land the ops position

hi will
ben  how you doing
you call him will
why not
hes second in command of this ship thats why not
im not starfleet im a civilian when hes in here he wants to be treated like a civilian
riker i bet he sleeps in his uniform
you only think that because hes your co if you got to know him
right
hes convinced commander riker doesnt like him
why did you crash the ship into something
no he just doesnt like me
he doesnt even know you
thats right you should go talk to him
about what
perhaps something you have in common
he likes jazz poker hes canadian
yeah my grandfather was from canada
there you go
hi
excuse me ive got to go talk to somebody

good evening sir
lavelle something i can do for you
no sir i just came to get another drink
is there something wrong with that one
no actually i er what are you having
trakian ale
good choice ill have one too my grandfather was canadian you know
really
arent you one too
a grandfather
no canadian sir canadian
no i grew up in alaska
oh well they both get a lot of snow
yeah
it was good talking to you sir

your ale ensign

were holding position in the argaya system
anything
no sir i detect no vessels in the vicinity
how close to the cardassian border are we
less than five thousand kilometres sir
sir i am detecting an object five metres in length it appears to be an escape pod
they must have been forced to abandon the ship
how far inside cardassian space is it
fifty thousand kilometres
how the hell are we going to get it out of there
sir the pods life support system is failing
notify doctor crusher
can we get within transporter range without crossing into cardassian territory
we would need to boost the gain on the confinement beam by at least seven percent
mister la forge

im on it captain there try that
the pod is still too far away
im going to try augmenting the frequency spread
bio readings indicate that passengers humanoid attempting life form identification
no one told you to do that ensign lets just get him aboard safely there that should do it
confinement beams at one hundred nine percent of normal
transporter room you should be able to get a lock now
aye sir

doctor crusher are you ready
stand by alyssa im afraid im going to have to ask you to leave now
all right doctor

transporter room go ahead
aye sir


what are you doing here
im not supposed to let anyone but the senior officers inside sickbay
do you have any idea whats going on
no do you
id better go

ensign
sir

twelve hundred hours alpha shift is relieved
excuse me sir if you dont mind id like to stay on for another shift i could use the training
nows not the best time
yes sir

ensign youre with me

bridge you are a certified pilot ensign
yes sir

how long have you served on board the enterprise ensign
seven months sir
i see i understand that youve been recommended for the ops position do you think youre up to it
i do sir
im not so sure im concerned about your record
sir

the incident that you were involved in at the academy

with all due respect that was three years ago my record since then
it doesnt matter how long ago it was ensign would you do something like that again
i can assure you sir that i would never never jeopardise lives by participating in
a dare devil stunt i would certainly hope not what concerns me is that you participated in a coverup that impeded an official investigation into the death of a cadet
sir i know i should have told the truth right from the start
yes you should but you didnt instead you joined with the others to pretended that was si
thine own self

bridge officers log stardate  doctor beverly crusher reporting we have rendezvoused with counsellor trois shuttlecraft she has just returned from a three day class reunion on starbase two three one


send a message to commander data and inform him of our delay
aye sir

deanna welcome back
thank you i was just reporting in i didnt expect to find anyone up except data
datas away on assignment a federation deep space probe went off course and crashed on barkon four some of the material in the casing was radioactive so data was sent to recover it before it could contaminate the biosphere
isnt barkon four inhabited
yes its a preindustrial society but the probe crashed over a hundred kilometres from the nearest settlement so data shouldnt have any contact with the barkonians so how was the reunion
fine it was good to see some old friends id lost touch with most of them its interesting to see the different paths some of their lives have taken beverly you dont usually stand a watch on the bridge even when datas not here
i volunteered tonight i like to put in a little bridge time now and then stay on top of operations tactical procedures the truth is i like it its not every doctor who gets to command a starship even if it is the night shift
may i ask you a personal question why did you decide to become a commander i mean you didnt need the rank in order to be chief medical officer so why put yourself through all the extra work
oh i dont know i never even thought about my rank for a long time it seemed pretty trivial compared to being a doctor but then about eight years ago i started to feel like i wanted to stretch myself a little
commander theres no response from commander data to our signal
continue sending him updates on our schedule
aye sir
is something wrong
no i wanted to let data know thered be a delay in picking him up for a few of days we have orders to rendezvous with the lexington and take some medical supplies to the taranko colony
but hes not responding
geordi said that the radiation from the probe might interfere with communications i just thought id try anyway


so when you return from school tonight ill be meeting with the village elders
again
gia
i know i know youre the town magistrate and you have a lot of work to do but it always seems like youre always in some meeting or

gia go home now who are you what do you want

 who are you what do you want
whats wrong with you
whats wrong with you
theres nothing wrong with me who are you what is your name can you understand me my name is garvin
my name is garvin

i thought i told you to go home
i know
i do not know my name
what
you asked if i knew my name i do not
well at least you seem to be understanding a little more
yes it is becoming easier
ask him where hes from father
gia go on to school ill deal with the stranger
yes father goodbye
goodbye
your eyes and skin look so strange your clothes you look like youve been in some kind of accident
i do not remember being in an accident
what do you remember
i walked here from the mountains
the mountains the mountains are over two hundred seltons from here
i have a clear memory of my journey
what do you remember before that
i have no prior memory
do you know what that is

no
may i may i have it
yes
there might be something in here that can tell us who you are
i wonder what these markings mean
radioactive
what
that is what is written on the container
you can read this language
evidently
radioactive what does that mean
i do not know perhaps it is my name
ive never heard a name like that you must come from a very distant place



is that supposed to be a question

because if youre asking me if i liked what you were playing then the answer is yes

you know this is a much better way of communicating for you its far less confusing than the way you normally speak

i knew i could count on my imzadi the ships counsellor to boost my selfimage
im glad to be of service
did you come here for something in particular or just general riker bashing
actually i wanted to ask your opinion about something ive been thinking about taking the bridge officers test and becoming a full commander
what brought this up
a lot of things working on the personnel review last month talking with beverly about her experiences going to my class reunion
ah the class reunion you saw a few old friends who had already taken the test
all right i admit it was a catalyst but i can honestly say that ive been thinking about this off and on over the past two years
why the past two years
do you remember when the enterprise hit that quantum filament and i was in command on the bridge
i do
well when that happened i was overwhelmed but when it was over i realised that a part of me missed it not the actual disaster but the experience of being in command i felt like i was exploring a whole new side of myself not that i want to give up counselling by any means but i really would like to stretch myself a little
deanna if you take the bridge officers test youll have my complete support but as first officer ill be the one judging your performance and you should know i am a pretty tough judge
and im a pretty good student
well start tomorrow morning oh eight hundred hours


remarkable set of teeth breath smells like well it doesnt have any smell actually you can close your mouth lets see heartbeat sounds a little odd but seems very regular skin feels clammy but you say you feel fine
that is correct
no headaches palpitations sluggishness indigestion
no but i cannot have indigestion since i have not eaten
ah malnutrition you should try to eat something that will build strength and return your vitality lots of meat butter cheese that should be a start
what about his eyes and his skin theyre so odd
quite so quite so im sure my grandmother would have called our friend here a demon or spirit or some kind of monster but current scientific methodology allows us to dismiss such ridiculous superstitions and concentrate on scientific reality
then what do you believe i am
you are an ice man
ice man
yes you probably come from a race of people who lived in the snow and ice of the vellorian mountains your skin and eye colouration are a result of prolonged exposure to harsh winter conditions
then i am not ill
aside from your memory loss you do not seem to have any symptoms of any illness that i am familiar with no you are an ice man now get something to eat and a good nights rest and i will come back tomorrow to see if your memory has begun to return
thank you
hello gia
hello

what did talur say about him is he sick
not exactly she said hes lost his memory but seems to be fine otherwise talur thinks hes from a race that lives in the mountains
i am an ice man
well have to call you something besides ice man until your memory returns what was the word on the container
radioactive
mister radioactive
i dont like that name lets call him jayden
what do you think of that
jayden that is acceptable
right now we need to clean him up and get him something decent to wear run upstairs and get some of my old clothes for him
yes father
i wonder if skoran can tell us something about this metal of yours


you ice man whered you find this
i do not know
i told you hes lost his memory and were calling him jayden for now
jayden huh the metal is slightly warm
all the fragments are like that

its obviously been tempered and milled the lustrous quality of the metal is so pure this wasnt made in any forge ive ever seen will you sell them
you want them
the metals malleable enough to make some jewellry
they belong to jayden do you want to sell them youre going to need money
you may be right but i do not wish to sell all the fragments they may provide a clue to my identity
ill give you twenty doraks for half the lot
agreed

my leg my leg get it off get it off

we need a lever
itll be all right dont struggle it will only

jayden put it down
i believe the support structure on the anvil collapsed because some of the wood had rotted did i do something wrong garvin
no just unexpected


its perfectly understandable your people probably all have great strength it will allow them to fight off the ferocious creatures that live in the vellorian mountains
you have told me no one from the village has ever been to the vellorian mountains how can you be certain there are ferocious creatures there
its a well known fact
but no one has actually seen one
well not to my knowledge but
father are you all right
ive been tired since this afternoon im sure its nothing
you feel slightly warm some fresh air and a brisk walk will do you good
that sounds like a good idea ill be back soon

you didnt like it
i neither liked it nor disliked it i simply had no appetite
fathers cooking isnt as good as mothers he tries though
where is your mother
she died about a year ago father says she went to a beautiful place where everything is peaceful and everyone loves each other and no one ever gets sick do you think theres really a place like that

yes i do


we just lost contact with everything above deck twenty one including the bridge
there is something wrong with one of the antimatter containment units the magnetic field is starting to fluctuate
switch to auxiliary control
auxiliary control is not online we are starting to lose containment on antimatter storage unit three
all right switch the em power inverter to the lateral no wait use the neodyne relay
commander the neodyne relay isnt holding containment failure in ten seconds
computer emergency procedure eject antimatter storage unit three authorisation troi omega omega three one
unable to comply all power to ejection systems has been terminated and cannot be restored
commander the units beginning to o

congratulations you just destroyed the enterprise
thank you for the encouragement
dont feel bad you passed everything else diplomatic law first contact procedures bridge operations the engineering qualifications one of the toughest parts of the test
so what did i do wrong
im afraid i cant tell you that
why not what kind of a test is this
its the kind of a test that youll have to take again if you want to be a bridge officer only next time the problem wont be so easy so i suggest you study up on your emergency procedures
well how do i know what to study if you wont tell me what i did wrong
i dont know im afraid i cant tell you that either

rock fire sky and water are the basic elements of the universe they can be found in every object every person every animal everything the rock in this wood can be felt by its weight and by its hardness if we expose the wood to flame we can encourage the fire within the wood to show itself we can also see smoke which is a part of the sky the water in wood is difficult to see sometimes the elements are buried deep within the objects but the four elements are always there  yes jayden
i do not believe that is correct
oh
i believe you are reasoning by analogy classifying objects and phenomena according to superficial observation rather than empirical evidence wood for example does not contain fire simply because it is combustible nor does it contain rock simply because it is heavy wood like any complex organic form is composed of thousands of different chemical compounds none of which is fire
that will be enough for now jayden as i told you earlier our friend jayden here has lost much of his memory so i wouldnt put too much faith in any of his ideas now that will be all for today i will see you tomorrow be sure to practice your spelling and arithmetic tonight
are you all right
yes but i do not agree with talurs assessment although i do have gaps in my memory i know that fire is not an element

that is not what you promised me
youre getting old garvin i offered you fifteen for the metal and ive given it to you no more
we agreed on twenty
garvin is correct you agreed on twenty
stay out of this ice man your memory is not very reliable

father father whats wrong
i dont know i feel very weak suddenly
you have got a fever we should get him home

whats wrong with him
i suspect he  i dont know ive never encountered anything like this before these lesions look like burn marks the fluids of his body have overheated that would explain the fever and the burning skin keep him cool let plenty of fresh air into the house and i want you to give him these herbs that will bring his fluidic temperature down and allow this to pass
i understand

with an increased focal length and an achromatic objective lens this instrument will have a higher effective magnification
i will come back tomorrow and check on you
thank you

garvin with your permission i would like to begin my own investigation regarding the cause of your illness
go ahead
gia i would like you to accompany me to the village i will need some supplies


what are you going to do with all this
i will use these materials to make the laboratory equipment i need to research your fathers illness
do you think you can help him
i do not know first i must isolate the cause of the illness
there he is its his fault none of us were sick before he came to the village
true
am i to understand that garvins illness has spread
thats right and youre the cause
thats not true
gia i think we should leave
thats it leave get out of here go back where you came from


jayden what are you doing
i am studying skin samples from gia and garvin in an attempt to isolate the cause of the illness
gia
yes she is also beginning to show signs of the illness
what is that
it is a magnifying device based on your handheld instrument i have refined the design to increase the magnification level
may i
of course
how strong is the magnification
objects appear approximately five hundred times their normal size as you can see the cellular damage is quite extensive however based on interstitial transparency and membrane integrity i do not believe it is an infection or any other form of communicable disease
i see
at the moment i am looking for a common event or experience that gia garvin and skoran might have shared that could have a causal relationship to their illness
well theyve all lived here in the village for many years im sure they have many common experiences
yes but since the illness struck all three in a relatively short period of time it is reasonable to assume the experience is recent and unusual
actually jayden encountering you has been the most unusual experience that theyve all shared recently
i am aware of that excuse me i am also open to the possibility that i may in some way be the causal factor however since you have had a great deal of contact with me and you show no signs of the sickness i tend to discount myself as a likely candidate
still it has to be more than just a coincidence that shortly after you arrived people started to become ill
i agree

jayden i tried to give father his broth but he wont eat
you have a fever you should be in bed
no im all right father needs me
talur is correct you should rest i will attend to your father gia when did you begin wearing that pendant
two days ago father bought it from skoran why
may i see it this is one of the metal fragments i sold to skoran

the secondary plasma vent has a triple redundant bypass which means that the primary access junction is routed through

come in would be routed through the port transducer matrix come to give me more encouragement
no im actually here to tell you that ive decided to cancel the rest of your test
what
im cancelling the test
may i ask why
youve taken the engineering qualification three times youre no closer to passing
well then ill take it four times or fourteen times or however many times are necessary for me to get it right
deanna this is nothing personal not everyone is cut out to be a bridge officer i dont think this is for you
why because im not the most technicallyminded person on the ship i may have trouble telling the difference between a plasma conduit and a phase inducer but theres more to being a bridge officer than memorising technical manuals
thats right there is you could spend the next month memorising all the technical manuals in the computer i still dont think youd pass the test
tell me one thing is there a solution or is this simply a test of my ability to handle a nowin situation
there is a solution
then give me time to find it
i cant as much as i care about you my first duty is to the ship i cannot let any bridge officer serve whos not qualified im sorry

my first duty is to the ship the ship

computer load bridge officers test engineering qualification section one
computer ready
run programme
the control system for the primary containment field is not functioning
somethings severed the odn conduit between here and the antimatter storage deck
geordi could you repair the odn conduit if you went into the crawlspace
sir that crawlway is in a warpplasma shaft he would never survive the radiation
i know that geordi could you repair the conduit
yeah i think i could
then do it thats an order

end simulation something told me you wouldnt let this go congratulations you passed
thats what this was all about wasnt it to see if id order someone to their death
thats right
i knew that was part of being in command and i thought id prepared for it but when the moment came i hesitated maybe you were right maybe im not cut out for this
you did exactly what you had to do you considered all your options you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice come on lets get out of here commander

i have coated this piece of cloth with the liquid which is used in lamps as you can see the cloth becomes luminescent when it is exposed to an energy source this pendant also appears to be an energy source

but where is this pattern of light coming from
i believe a stream of particles is emanating from the metallic pendant and hitting the cloth
i dont see any particles coming from the pendant
you will see there are i can even block them

it would appear that this container was constructed of a material which absorbs or blocks the particles coming from the metal
its a trick
no it is empirical data i believe the fragments were originally placed in this container to protect people from accidental exposure the word radioactive may be a warning about the dangerous nature of the metal
all right lets say for the moment that youre right that there are invisible particles coming from the metal what should we do
i will continue my experiment i would like you to gather all the pieces of metal in the village and place them in this container
all right but when i return i want a more thorough explanation of all this and i want to examine your data in detail
of course

there you are youre the cause of this ice man
if you are referring to the illness you are partially correct however it is more complex than that the metal fragment which

what what are you

i do not know

i saw it with my own eyes hes not a person hes some kind of creature
its not true father
we must find him and stop him before he kills us all
i dont not jayden he wouldnt try to hurt us
come on

let him rest for now you should rest as well exerting yourself will only make you sicker ill be back

gia
jayden everyones looking for you skoran said youre some kind of creature
i do not know what i am but i am not like you
i know youre an ice man we talked about that
no i am not
jayden why are you wearing that hood
i do not wish to frighten you
i wont be afraid take it off please i have to see

i understand your reaction but i do not wish to harm you you or garvin or anyone else i only wish to help to find a cure for the illness i was very close i must to continue my work but it will take time how long until skoran and the others return
i dont know theyre looking for you now
then i must hurry

gia i believe i have found the answer
you think you found a cure
i believe so i tested this medicine on skin samples from your father they showed improvement so i administered this to him he is now recovering
what kind of medicine is it
a compound i made which will neutralise the particles that are making you ill swallow this i must administer this to everyone in the village but i do not think they will trust me after what happened to skoran
i could tell them
i am afraid they will not believe you either gia is the well in the town square the only source of water for this village
well
this is very important are there any other sources of fresh water near the village
no the nearest river is two days away
then i will put this compound into the well water it may be diluted but it should still have enough potency to work
compound


there he is you see its just as i said
i only wish to help
this is how youve helped us by bringing this plague tried to kill us all well you wont succeed i wont let you



excuse me were looking for a friend of ours he might have wandered into your village a few days ago
youd remember him he would have appeared very strange pale skin gold eyes
he was your friend
yes do you know him
where is he

i dont understand
we didnt know his real name so we called him jayden
youre saying hes dead
they killed him because they were afraid of him but he saved all of us from the sickness
the sickness
there were these pieces of metal they made everyone sick but jayden put something in the water and now everyones better
what happened to these pieces of metal
we buried them in the forest what was his real name
data
data he was my friend too

its data all right hes buried about two metres down hes been deactivated so i cant tell how bad the damage is
we could beam him and the probe fragments right onto the ship no one would know

positronic net online subprocessor relays in place and neuroelectrical systems enabled

data are you all right
i do not know i am surprised to find myself here i thought i was on barkon four
whats the last thing you remember
i had located the crashed federation probe and collected the radioactive fragments i was attempting to download the sensor logs from the probes onboard computer there was a power surge i believe the surge overloaded my positronic matrix after that i have no memory until this moment  it appears i had an interesting time
we dont know much about what happened either apparently you saved an entire village from radiation poisoning
and you were a very special friend to a little girl
well if youll excuse me i have the bridge this watch
counsellor have you been promoted in my absence
thats right which means from now on you can call me sir
yes sir
masks



 thats very good  well thats very nice
no it isnt i just cant get it right do you think the wings are too big
not at all birds have wings of all sizes eric and you shouldnt worry about making it look perfect
but mrs narsu said we should try to make our sculptures as realistic as possible
shes right it is important that you be able to make the clay take the shape you want it to have but youre not supposed to be concentrating on technique today im here to help you focus on the feelings you want to convey with your sculpture for instance what do you think about when you see a bird
flying
fine so make your sculpture make me think of flying too

hows it going data
i have finished

the dimensions are accurate to within one point three percent
im sure they are data you obviously dont have a trouble with realism but youre here to work on your imagination maybe you should try something a little more abstract here i want you to start a new piece id like you to sculpt music
counsellor music is a collection of acoustic vibrations how can i reproduce a sound with clay
well think of the effects that sounds have on people the images that music brings to your mind and then give it a form

its a start
riker to data please report to the bridge
acknowledged sir on my way
captains log stardate  we have encountered a rogue comet in sector one one five six it is not native to this region of space and there is no previous record of this object on any federation charts

based on its present trajectory the comet appears to have originated in the darsay system
thats over two sectors away
that is correct sir this object has been en route for eighty seven million years
thats a long time alone in the dark
begin a full sensor analysis mister data and log the findings with the federation astrophysical survey
aye sir the comets outer shell is composed primarily of gaseous hydrogen and helium surrounding an icy mantle the inner core consists of heavier elements

what was that
there is distortion within the comets inner core i believed we experienced an intense sensor echo
can you correct for it
i am attempting to do so now sir i have compensated for the effect sensors are reconfigured for a low intensity sweep we are still picking up some interference but the distortion is manageable at these settings the scan will be complete in thirty nine hours

worf says hes going to teach us some mokbara throwing techniques today
more like falling techniques last time we did that i was sore for a week
whats this

i have no idea ive never seen it before
maybe will left it for you a little present
its not quite his style
then maybe its a secret admirer
thats an interesting thought
well youll figure it out later come on were going to be late


 thats nice data this is amazing how did you come up with this

i followed your advice counsellor i used my imagination
thats an understatement
for some reason as i was shaping the clay the image of the mask was exceptionally clear in my mind the design seemed to flow quite naturally
data have you been in my quarters
no counsellor
somebody left an object in my room some kind of artefact and it has something very similar to this and you dont know anything about it
i do not
excuse me counsellor can you help me with my terminal its not working right

perhaps we should investigate this matter further

these symbols dont match anything in the federation linguistic banks
some kind of alien information has been downloaded into our computer core i dont know how its working but its reconfiguring our systems
how did it get in
i was able to trace its path from the replicators to the sensor array
the sensors theyve been scanning that comet for the past eighteen hours
those energy readings from the comets core that sensor echo we still dont know whats inside that thing
maybe its about time we found out could we use the phasers to melt down the shell of the comet
yeah a dispersed widefield beam might do the trick it wouldnt take long to come up with the firing parameters what do you think data

data whats wrong
i believe i recognise these symbols
how
i do not know
do you think maybe your systems have been affected
it is a possibility i do not believe my systems are currently impaired but i will run a full diagnostic to make certain
what do you think they mean
boundary border road companion message messenger

whats that one
death

captain phasers are set for wide dispersal ten percent maximum power the beam will automatically terminate once the comets core is reached
very well mister worf fire
phasers have terminated

mister data what are we looking at is it a ship
i do not know sir the object is nearly solid it is composed primarily of fortanium and several unknown materials it is over eighty seven million years old
thats older than the comet itself could someone from the darsay system have built it
there are no technologically advanced cultures in that system now but perhaps eighty seven million years ago there were
why would they want to hide something like that inside a comet
possibly it accumulated those frozen gasses over time as it travelled through space
in any case its definitely responsible for the system anomalies weve been experiencing theyre using our sensor beam as a carrier wave to transmit information into our computers and replicators
but the question remains why what is its purpose
captain i believe this object is an informational archive
why do you say that mister data
i do not know however i seem to have an intuitive understanding of its function
data the internal structure of that thing is pretty complex and its got a repetitive node configuration which might suggest a database of some kind but it could be practically anything i dont see how you could know for sure what it is
data do you believe that youre in communication with that object
it is a possibility sir i recommend we run a level one diagnostic of my positronic net immediately to determine if that is the case
very well mister laforge give him a hand
aye sir
do you think its just trying to make contact with us
yes its possible but if that is an archive from some ancient civilisation we should allow it to do so but we must be careful mister worf will you keep an eye on the sensors if the ship is in any danger i want you to sever the connection immediately
aye sir


come
captain
yes come in number one
weve confined the system corruption it wont be spreading any further but we still have alien symbols floating around on our computer this is quite a collection youve assembled ive seen these things all over the ship they all look the same primitive and nonfunctional
ceremonial and deceptively primitive only an advanced technological society could have built that object out there these artefacts played a ritualistic role in that society i think
do you think data could be right could we have stumbled across some sort of alien library
oh yes its possible and if so this is a find of most enormous significance that library seems designed to do so much more than simply store information who knows what we might learn from this
i keep seeing this design
yes this symbol seems to be of particular significance
what do you think it means
the concept of the four cardinal compass directions is quite common in many different cultures
the words that data recognised in the computer boundary border road they were all arranged in this design
well perhaps the artefacts that all have this compass symbol belong to the same theme movement finding a direction travelling a path crossing a boundary
and death one of the symbols was death
the ultimate boundary
ive seen this symbol everywhere too but much less prominently displayed its always in the background smaller than the others

what do you think it represents
i have no idea

lower synaptic functions are completely normal autonomous systems all check out
i suggest we examine the memory subsystem next
all right  data whats wrong
i am not certain i am experiencing a curious sensation
well what is it
an impulse
impulse what kind of impulse
i do not know
im going to check out your higher functions
geordi what does it feel like when a person is losing his mind
data come on youre scaring me now whats going on
i do not know i am different
well youre going to be all right youre with me okay
okay
listen im going to disconnect you  whats going on

data

masaka is waking

captain
captain ive been waiting for you you should feel honoured i dont usually wait for anyone
what is it you want
masaka is waking
are you masaka
i am not masaka i am ihat
what have you done to commander data
commander data you mean the one who was here
yes
hes gone who can say where
picard to counsellor troi report to main engineering immediately
picard to counsellor troi report to main engineering immediately
ihat this place you come from is it a cultural archive of your species
i come from masakas city
are there others like you there
data goes to lie on the pool t
eye of the beholder


we are losing containment in the starboard nacelle tube
try to get more power to the field coils
aye sir
mister la forge

report
i cant shut down the plasma injectors somebodys locked out the controls

the plasma venting system has engaged


two more decks
riker to bridge weve almost reached the nacelle tube
acknowledged

release the exterior hull plate we may have to jettison the core
aye sir


what happened
 he locked out the controls before we knew what was happening he stepped up onto the walkway
 see if you can help shut down the plasma flow
im afraid if we try to get any closer he will jump through the forcefield
dan its me its will riker i was here yesterday remember
 i didnt want to do it but i saw them and they laughed at me they laughed

whatever happened we can talk about it i want to help
stay away
i just want to see your face thats all so we can talk
i know what i have to do
dan no
i have unlocked the controls
shutdown procedure initiated
theres still plasma in the injector itll take time to vent off
tell me what happened maybe i can help
i know what i have to do


a few more seconds i couldve saved his life
commander you did everything you could it was not your fault
it was strange i felt as if he didnt even recognise me although i was with him just the other day when i supervised the tube refit
how did he seem then
fine i complimented him on getting the refit done faster than expected he was pleased that id noticed
i met with him about six weeks ago during the crew evaluations he was very positive he was looking forward to being posted to the nacelle tube
he was a good officer with a fine career ahead of him i dont understand why he wanted
in my years as a starship captain ive had to notify many parents of the loss of loved ones but never before a suicide i would like to be able to offer lieutenant kwans parents some explanation of what happened to try to help them make sense of this
maybe he left a message of some kind explaining why he did it
i would like the two of you to piece together a picture of his last few days
if he made any personal logs it might be helpful to look through them
youre authorised to do so

la forge to captain
go ahead

ive just finished my damage assessment we should be able to get underway id say within the hour
mister la forge

the medical situation on barson two has worsened starfleet has given us permission to exceed warp speed limitations so as to get back on schedule

well be able to give you warp eight if you need it
acknowledged
geordi would you agree that the instinct for selfpreservation is shared by most life forms
id say its probably the most basic instinct data
that being the case i find it difficult to understand why someone would deliberately terminate their own existence
i dont know data all i can think is that maybe lieutenant kwan felt that there was something wrong in his life something he felt powerless to fix
i believe i understand i have been in a similar situation
really
the first months following my activation were a difficult period for me there were many problems associated with my becoming sentient
because your neural net was still forming
as i acquired new skills neural pathways would form replacing other less complex pathways it was very disorienting
i bet
as my systems grew in complexity it became increasingly difficult to integrate new pathways into my existing neural net the probability of cascade failure grew with each additional pathway i came to the conclusion it would be safer and easier to shut myself down and start again
yeah but if you had done that you wouldnt have remembered any of the things that had happened to you
in a way it would have been like committing suicide
so what did you do
i decided against the procedure i chose instead to treat the problems i was having with my systems as challenges to overcome rather than obstacles to be avoided
great way of looking at it data i wish lieutenant kwan had been able to look at his problems the same way

this is a napean design
his mothers napean his fathers human it all looks so normal for some reason i half expected the place to be a mess
yes it is strange to think that someone could have considered ending his life and yet give no outward sign just before he jumped he seemed almost calm
well he must have been in a lot of pain to do what he did it could be that the prospect of ending the pain felt like a great relief

this is ensign calloway isnt it
yes she is a medical technician in sickbay
its always hard to lose someone you care about but to lose them like this
we should check his personal logs
this is his last entry he made it before going on duty this morning
personal log stardate  we finally finished the nacelle tube refit last night after pulling two double shifts in a row im really looking forward to spending some time with maddy
ensign calloway that doesnt sound like a man whos planning on taking his own life
no no it does not

i cant believe hes really gone i keep thinking hes going to show up and tell me theres been some kind of terrible misunderstanding
i thought you might like to know that in his personal logs dan talked about you a great deal he loved you very much
if thats true then how could he leave me like this
thats what im trying to find out i know its hard to talk right now but it would be very helpful if you could tell me a few things about him when was the last time you saw him
two nights ago we were planning our next shore leave together
did he mention anything that had happened recently anything that might have upset him
no not really he did say something about work about lieutenant nara but it wasnt anything serious
nara shes his superior officer in the nacelle tube
yes dan sensed that she well that she felt threatened by him that she thought he was after her position
was he prone to mood swings or depression
no but he was very sensitive to other peoples moods he used to look at me and know exactly what i was feeling i always loved that about him
well napeans are partially empathic he may have inherited some of his mothers abilities
he used to tease me that when i met her i wouldnt be able to get away with anything dan and i knew each other for over two years but we didnt get together until a few months ago we took it slow we thought we had all the time in the world something must have happened to him counsellor something terrible because its not like dan to take his own life
i understand
please find out what it was

can i help you
oh i didnt see you there youre lieutenant nara arent you
can i do something for you counsellor
im investigating lieutenant kwans death and i just wanted to look around
its such a shame he was a good man
did you notice any change in his behaviour recently
no ive been going over the last few days in my mind trying to see if i if i missed any warning signs its as if something in him just snapped
how was his job performance
excellent he knew this ship better than most people probably because he helped build it back at utopia planitia
did he get along with his coworkers
he was ambitious he came in here with all sorts of new ideas about how to do things some of them very good ideas
but not all
no but after he settled in we got along fine

excuse me a minute feel free to look around
where was lieutenant kwans station
right there

are you all right
i dont know

i dont know how to describe it i was suddenly overwhelmed by a flood of emotions fear rage panic and the sensations didnt seem to be coming from any person they were just there in the room
whose emotions were they i thought you said were alone
i was
i scanned the area i found no anomalous readings
how could you get an empathic impression from an empty room
i dont know
could the fact that lieutenant kwan was partially empathic have anything to do with it
what do you mean
im not sure but certainly the feelings troi described are consistent with suicide
could his death have left some sort of empathic echo
i dont see how but if i went back to the nacelle tube i might get a better sense of what i experienced
i dont think id recommend that right now youre showing elevated levels of psilosynine
psilosynine
its a neurotransmitter involved in telepathy the experience overwhelmed you the first time i think you should wait until your levels return to normal
how long
three maybe four hours
this time i want someone with you
i shall accompany you counsellor
captains log stardate  weve arrived at starbase three twenty eight on schedule after taking aboard medical supplies we will depart for barson two

come in hello worf
counsellor have you found anything in lieutenant kwans logs
everything ive read suggests that he was welladjusted and optimistic it just doesnt make any sense can i get you anything
no no nothing
yridian tea ive been thinking about what happened to me in the nacelle tube whether it was an empathic echo left by kwans death
in the past have your empathic experiences always involved the physical presence of another person
all the ones im sure of yes
what do you mean sure of
well when i was a young girl my grandfather used to tell me stories by the fire i would close my eyes and listen to his mind for hours on end
he would tell you these stories telepathically
my grandfather rarely spoke he said that was for offworlders and people who didnt know any better now the only time i can remember his stories is when i go home and sit by the fireplace sometimes when im alone there its almost as if i can hear his voice inside my head
yes yes i too have sought visions in fire
i cant explain it but it feels real to me just like what happened in the nacelle tube
there are things we do not understand yet they exist nonetheless perhaps i should let you get some rest
oh its all right
if you will excuse me counsellor


mister worf
commander
two tilamin froths please
yes sir
lieutenant corell seems to be enjoying your company
id like to think so
are you involved with her
im not sure yet why are you interested
no but if i were i would of course discuss the situation with you before proceeding further
i appreciate it but that really wouldnt be necessary
i mean i would never want to come between you and someone you are involved with or had ever been involved with
is there someone in particular that youre talking about
no is there someone in particular you would rather i not be involved with
mister worf you sound like a man whos asking his friend if he can start dating his sister
no no i was merely never mind excuse me sir


could you open this door for me
yes but only for a short time after ninety seconds the plasma venting system will engage to prevent degradation of the forcefield
i just want to take a quick look
may i ask what youre looking for
im not sure

warning plasma venting system will engage in ninety seconds
no no no please please please no dont no
warning plasma venting system will engage in eighty seconds

worf

worf

counsellor are you all right

lets get out of here

do you remember anything else
yes i think i do there was a tool crate on the floor it was labeled utopia planitia
the shipyard where the enterprise was built
clearly this was much more than an empathic echo it seems that you were actually seeing something that happened in the control room eight years ago
everyone was looking directly at me but it was as though i was seeing through someone elses eyes
lieutenant kwan was partially empathic
maybe you were seeing it through his eyes
its possible but i dont see how it could have happened
well putting that on one side for the moment lets assume that by some unexplained phenomenon you witnessed an event that occurred to lieutenant kwan those faces that you saw did you recognise any of them
ive never seen the woman before or the man who was with her but there was someone else there a man he was staring at me in the most peculiar way i think he had reddish hair and he did seem familiar to me but its all so hazy its like trying to remember a dream
there was a woman who was frightened and then you saw her again laughing presumably at lieutenant kwan
what does it all mean
i dont know but something terrible happened in there i felt it
counsellor i want you to look through the personnel files of utopia planitia see if you can recognise any of those faces
if only i could go back to the control room without being overwhelmed by the experience it might help me remember some detail that might be relevant
i could give you an inhibitor that would slow the brains production of psilosynine that might be able to suppress your empathic abilities and make the experience more manageable it would take about sixteen hours to synthesise the inhibitor
id like to try that
very well counsellor


i apologise for being late the viral medicines we are transporting to barson two require special security measures to insure they are properly contained have you found anything
no there were literally thousands of people involved in building the enterprise
perhaps if you should try to narrow the search parameters
i think i have the man who looked familiar to me may have served on board the enterprise in the last seven years so ive asked the computer to limit its search to personnel who served at utopia planitia and on the enterprise
ensign salvatore he transferred over a year ago lieutenant ziff shes in quantum mechanics thats him
lieutenant walter pierce
i remember now he came on board about six months ago i think hes in engineering

you were lieutenant kwans supervisor at utopia planitia
thats right i was sorry to hear what happened
did you ever spend time in the nacelle control room while it was under construction
i worked all over the ship in fact i remember running a power conduit right behind this wall here
were you ever in the nacelle room at the same time as lieutenant kwan
it was a long time ago people were working all over the place
so you do not remember
im sorry i dont
do you recall if anything unusual happened there
how do you mean
an altercation perhaps possibly involving lieutenant kwan
no nothing like that the way i remember it things went pretty smoothly whats this all about if you dont mind my asking
not at all when i was in the nacelle room i had an empathic experience
we believe the counsellor may have been seeing an event that occurred eight years ago
and i saw you there do you have any idea why that might be
im afraid i dont
lieutenant are you aware that i can sense when someones telling the truth
ive heard that
then im sure that if you remember anything that might be relevant to our investigation youll contact me
of course
thank you lieutenant
counsellor

the strange thing is i couldnt read him at all
but you implied that we have played poker together many times ive never known you to bluff
well it wouldnt be much of a bluff if you knew would it the fact that i couldnt read him suggests that he has at least some telepathic ability
but pierce is human
thats what i dont understand even though i couldnt read his emotions i did feel that he was holding something back
i thought so as well
maybe we should try to access the engineering logs from utopia planitia we might find out more about him
there may be something in them about lieutenant kwan as well

it going to take about half an hour for the transmission to be completed
perhaps we should continue this in the morning
it is late
yes and you must be tired
a little
so i will say goodnight
goodnight
we should get an early start tomorrow
i think we should ill see you in the morning
yes


hello
breakfast is ready
that sounds nice but it can wait why didnt we do this a long time ago
crusher to counsellor troi
yes doctor

ive synthesised the inhibitor please come to sickbay whenever youre ready

acknowledged
crusher to lieutenant worf
worf here
medical supplies are ready to be taken to cargo bay for transport
i will be there shortly


this should take effect immediately
will it completely suppress my empathic abilities
its hard to say for sure but i can always increase the dosage if its not enough

the cargo bay will be off limits to all but medical personnel
thanks for your help sir
youre welcome
good morning
counsellor
data and geordi are already in the nacelle tube are you ready
yes
excuse me sir about the quarantine field in the cargo bay it looks like well need a second field generator
i am needed here i will join you as soon as i can
all right
apparently my help was not so good after all
yes it was you were wonderful
i think i know whats wrong

counsellor you okay
im fine the inhibitor seems to be working have you found anything
no nothing unusual
i dont remember seeing these during my empathic experience have they been here since the ship was built
no they were installed two years ago

geordi i remember seeing a plasma conduit right there
the main odn line runs right behind that panel it lifts out so you can get to it
kwan was working on that conduit the day before he died
can you open it
sure itll take just a minute

data
lieutenant nara may i ask you something the work lieutenant kwan was doing was it unusual in any way
he was refitting a field coil but it was probably the first time that particular panels been opened since the ship was built
thank you


no

counsellor are you all right
something happened when you removed the panel theres something in there
i am getting readings that indicate organic material embedded in this wall
organic youre right let me reconfigure the emitter beam we might be able to see what it is there


this dosage should prevent any further empathic flashes
the bone fragments are definitely human i sequenced a dna sample ill see if i can match it to starfleet records

accessing starfleet personnel records

id say these fragments had been in the wall about seven or eight years you said something happened when the panel was opened
yes
i wonder if the fragments themselves could have somehow triggered your experience ill run a resonance scan see if anything turns up
sir i think weve found a match
apparently the remains are those of an ensign marla finn
im trying to find a picture of her in the records
thats her thats the woman i saw
it says she was reported missing from utopia planitia on stardate  eight years ago but how did her body become embedded in a bulkhead
maybe there was some kind of an accident
or she was killed and the murderer hid her remains
somethings not right pull up lieutenant kwans service record i thought so he didnt arrive at the shipyard until six months after finns death i couldnt have been seeing through his eyes
then whose
well it had to be someone who was at least partially telepathic
pierce
but you saw him there
yes but not as clearly as i could see everything else his face looked like that
a reflection
so i was seeing through his eyes and finn was trying to get away from him she was afraid of him
i think it is time we had another conversation with lieutenant pierce ensign calloway thank you for your help

deck ten
worf can i ask you something do you regret what happened last night
no of course not
are you sure because i dont want anything to jeopardise our friendship
deanna i do not regret being with you what is wrong
im not feeling myself maybe its the inhibitor im so used to sensing what people are feeling and now i cant
perhaps i should talk to lieutenant pierce alone
that might be a good idea
i will meet you in your quarters later
ill be waiting for you

deck eight

come in

security to counsellor trois quarters
acknowledged
i dont understand lieutenant worf said you wanted to talk to me about something
where is he
he said he had to go somewhere
troi to worf computer where is lieutenant worf
lieutenant worf is in ensign calloways quarters

counsellor
take lieutenant pierce to his quarters and hold him there


security override authorisation troi delta two nine


stop it stop it stop it

hes dead you killed him
no no

you know what you have to do




i know what i have to do

what are you doing
warning plasma venting system will engage in seventy seconds
youre alive youre all right


i opened the maintenance door at counsellor trois request then turned to see her standing too close to the force field
it all seemed so real to me i cant believe that everything i experienced happened in just those few seconds
it appears counsellor was correct pierce was partially telepathic his maternal grandmother was born on betazed
what else have you found out
according to starfleet records pierce and the other persons counsellor troi identified were killed in an accidental plasma discharge eight years ago their bodies were never found
i dont believe it was an accident i think lieutenant pierce found out the other two were having an affair he lost control and he killed them both afterwards he probably activated the plasma stream and then threw himself into it
the plasma discharge would have obliterated any evidence that it was murder

i scanned behind the panel counsellor troi asked me to i didnt find any bone fragments but i did find some traces of cellular residue showing some kind of psionic signature
it may be that when lieutenant pierce was struck by the plasma stream the subspace energy present there imprinted his empathic pattern into the residue
kind of like a psychic photograph
thats what triggered my hallucination my mind must have taken elements from my own life and then created a situation that in many ways mirrored what happened to pierce if you hadnt been there i would have jumped just like he did

counsellor when i pulled you from the plasma stream you seemed surprised i was alive
well actually in my hallucination you were killed
may i ask by whom
well you know what they say mister worf hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
genesis



so why were you rolling around in cypirion cactus
you know rebecca smith
the new tactical officer
we took a walk in the arboretum we sat down we got comfortable things got a little romantic and then i rolled over

blurred vision dizziness palpitations a stinging sensation in the lower spine its terrelian death syndrome isnt it
i thought we agreed youd come to me before checking starfleet medical database
yes well this time im glad i did maybe we can stop the cellular decay before its too late
reg you dont have terrelian death syndrome
you youre sure
im sure
 then maybe it is symbalene blood burn
no no i dont see anything wrong with you at all wait a minute there is a slight imbalance in your k three cell count
my k threes oh no
barclay im sure its nothing look ill run a microcellular scan well see thisll take a couple of minutes

hows my smallest patient doing
i believe she is doing well her appetite has increased by seven percent and she is starting to engage in prenatal behaviour

oh shes getting close youll have a fresh litter of hungry kittens before the week is over let me just run an amniotic scan to make sure everythings fine and then ill
doctor my capillaries are shrinking
excuse me alyssa can you take care of spot for a minute start a preliminary amniotic scan
yes doctor
my intravascular pressure its going right through the roof
youre right it is elevated youve also got heightened electrophoretic activity
electrophoretic activity is it serious
well based on this id say youve got seventy maybe eighty years
eighty eighty years
yes reg what youve got a mild case of urodelan flu its nothing serious most humans have a natural immunity to it but the tcell in your dna that would normally fight off the infection is dormant
so you mean i have bad genes
you have one dormant gene out of a hundred thousand and i can activate that gene with a synthetic tcell let the body attack the infection naturally you should feel better in a couple of days
thank you doctor i feel much better
good now stay away from medical database  and you stay out of the arboretum
everything looks fine data do you want to know the sex of the kittens
i have noticed that many humans prefer not to know in order to experience the surprise during birth i believe i will preserve the mystery until then
i know what you mean i dont want to know either
alyssa
spots not the only one whos going to be a mother
oh alyssa thats wonderful how did andrew take the news
he was a little shocked but hes getting over it
i have spent the past nine weeks as an expectant parent i would be happy to share my insights with your husband if my experience is any indication he will need all the help he can get
captains log stardate  were performing field tests of our new tactical systems and weapon upgrades mister worf is supervising the exercises

the next test will involve the new photon torpedoes the explosive yield has been increased by eleven percent and i have enhanced the targeting system for increased accuracy
sounds fascinating mister worf please proceed
setting targeting coordinates zero zero five mark three one seven spread pattern delta nine four torpedoes armed and loaded sir
fire when ready

worf
one of the torpedoes has veered off course it appears to be a malfunction in the guidance system
abort and destroy
the torpedo is not responding subspace detonator will not engage
lock on phasers
the torpedo is out of range
even for your newly improved phasers
maintain a sensor lock on the torpedo mister worf well have to go after it
that would be inadvisable sir the asteroid field is unusually dense the enterprise is too large to safely navigate through it
then ill take a shuttlecraft and retrieve it mister data youre with me
captain the shuttle pilot whos on duty is lieutenant hayes
i happen to be a reasonably qualified pilot number one besides these tests hardly require the captains personal attention
understood enjoy yourself
mister worf i think that you should consider analysing your new guidance system
captain i will need a few minutes to attend to a personal matter

me
it is possible that it will take several days for captain picard and me to complete our mission i would prefer to have a human present to supervise the birthing process
well id be honoured
i have noticed that you are the only other member of the crew whom spot seems to like
really thats hard to believe youre such a sweet little kitty
she is to you however there have been several injuries to other members of the crew who have attempted to care for her
so has she picked a place
a place
cats usually like to pick a specific location to give birth its usually dark and secluded and i believe this is it

im curious sir whos the father
i am not certain spot has escaped from my quarters on several occasions and there are twelve male felines on board i intend to run a full dna analysis on the kittens once they
picard to data report to shuttlebay two
on my way sir goodbye spot i believe you are in good hands
you have nothing to worry about sir


problem
i have performed thirteen diagnostics of the weapons array and i can find nothing wrong with the guidance system
ill have geordi run a diagnostic of the torpedo bay itself maybe he can find something
must you to stand so close to me
lieutenant are you all right
yes i am fine
no youre not youve been working for six hours straight youre tired take a break
but
thats an order lieutenant


thanks for waiting
do not approach me unannounced especially when im eating
worf we were supposed to have lunch together remember
i was hungry
well im hungry too excuse me
yes
can i have an order of ongilin caviar make that a double order
certainly
caviar for lunch
im in the mood for something salty besides its no stranger than what youre eating  have you noticed how dry the air is on the ship i wonder if the environmental controls are set properly

youre excused

is something wrong
it has been a difficult day the torpedo guidance system failed it was my fault
you always say that
it was my fault i designed that guidance system
worf calm down i think youre under more stress than youd like to admit maybe you should get some rest
perhaps you are right if you will excuse me
i didnt mean right now 



we removed the torpedo bays primary guidance module and found a power fluctuation in the forward sensor cluster now we think it may be a radial imbalance in the phase discriminator now what we want to do next is run a level four diagnostic but were going to have to shut down auxiliary power to nineteen decks and
wait a minute slow down i lost you back there which sensor clusters
the forward its its a power fluctuation in the converter nodes its a minor adjustment its minor
its all right in here in on diagram commander
ill look this over later go ahead you run your diagnostic ill inform the other departments about the power systems
ill check that
hes full of energy today
i cant get him to slow down hes been working like that since last night
looks like a plasma conduit cut out in junction seventeen ill go look at it
wait a minute reg ill go with you keep you posted


computer increase ambient temperature by two degrees centigrade and increase relative humidity by ten percent
computer reset environmental controls to standard
worf its freezing in here
you have already raised the temperature three times it is too hot
live with it computer execute my original command

i need a bath you have the bridge


here we are looks like a conduit ruptured no problem ill just bypass it
reg wait a second here take a look at these corroded edges here it looks like something has dissolved the bulkhead and eaten right through the conduit there are high levels of cholic acid here enzymatic agents you know i wouldnt be surprised if that solvent was organic
maybe we should run a biospectral analysis on the solvent take a closer look
thats a very good idea but first we should take a break
you go ahead sir ill take care of it

 commander we received a communication from starfleet they wanted to know when they could expect your performance analysis of the new weapon systems
the weapon systems
yes sir the ones weve been testing for the past few days
thats right
what should i tell them sir
tell them tell them we havent finished yet


what are you doing here
i had to be near you
computer increase temperature by five degrees
get out of that water now
leave me alone


can i have a glass of water its so cold in here
your temperature has dropped almost eight degrees i want to run a hypothalamic series right away
doctor weve had three other crewmembers complaining about the temperature levels some feel like they have fevers others are freezing like counsellor troi
call doctor selar and doctor hacopian it looks like weve got some sort of viral infection going on around here i want to check on lieutenant worf

worf have you had any unusual symptoms lately headaches nausea dizziness worf worf do you hear me i going to run a full bioscan i want you to lie down  okay we can do this sitting up what is this  worf how long have you had this on your neck it looks like its full of some bioacidic compound almost like a venom sac worf open your mouth

get a hypospray
right away

i managed to get her into stasis before the venom paralysed her shes going to need reconstructive surgery but i think shell be all right
 sir weve analysed the venom and compared it to the acidic compound found in junction seventeen and on decks ten and twelve they all have the same enzymatic composition
are you saying that worf is spraying this
venom
venom all over the ship
id say so
sixty crewmen have begun exhibiting strange behavioural changes memory loss fatigue headaches i think one thing is clear theres some sort of disease aboard the enterprise and its spreading
im having trouble concentrating myself its like my mind keeps wandering i cant

commander ive got seven security teams out hunting for worf but for some reason sensors are having a difficult time locking onto him ive called for a level two security alert do you think we should go to a level one
i dont know what do you think
i think we should
okay sounds good then youll take care of that security thing
yes sir i will
okay ill notify starfleet ill let them know whats happening you have your orders  dismissed

computer send a subspace message to starfleet command security channel authorisation
alpha four seven authorisation required to activate security channel
computer
awaiting authorisation

captains log supplemental commander data and i have recovered the stray torpedo after a three day search we are enroute back to the enterprise

captain the ship is not at the prearranged coordinates
have they been delayed
i do not know i am unable to raise them on any communication channel
scan the vicinity see if you can find them
i found it sir two light years away
set a course

the enterprise appears to be adrift i am reading power fluctuations on all decks
life signs
there are life signs however sensor readings are highly distorted i am unable to identify specific lifeforms
adjust the axial stabilisers to match the attitude and rotation rate of the enterprise im going to dock the shuttle manually

main power is offline all systems are in standby or emergency mode there is no response from any manned station
any sign of the crew
i cannot access internal sensors from here we will have to go to the bridge


that sounds like animals
yes sir i am able to discern over three hundred different vocalisations

look at this

it is composed of reptilian dna i believe it is an epidermal layer that has been cast off during moulting
but it seems to be humanoid
yes sir i cannot explain it there are no species aboard the enterprise that shed their skin in this fashion

sir
these are commander trois quarters can you tell if shes inside
no sir
data i want to have a look in here stand ready


the environmental settings in these quarters have been altered data over here

deanna

whats happened to her
her dna is in a state of ribocyatic flux her genetic codes are being resequenced and her cells are mutating as a result at a fundamental level sir she is no longer human
what is she
her respiratory tissue has become capable of metabolising both water and air and her eyes have developed nictitating membranes i believe she is amphibian sir
she has been injured
yes sir theres klingon dna in the wound it is saliva
are you saying shes been bitten
it would appear so

i will need to run a full biospectral analysis
first weve got to get the ship under control lets go to the bridge


his upper spinal column has been broken in three places
it looks like hes been attacked by some sort of animal
yes sir
has his dna been changed as well
yes sir however it was in its initial stages when he died captain i am picking up one thousand and eleven individual life forms within the ship all exhibit a similar genetic flux to the one we observed in counsellor troi
so the entire ship has been affected
most of the lifeforms are scattered throughout the ship however there are several large concentrations in the arboretum and the aquatic lab
ive regained attitude control for the ship but main power is still offline it looks as though the entire power transfer grid has been destroyed



will
captain his cranial plates have thickened by twenty percent his brain is much smaller sir i do not believe he can comprehend our language
perhaps we can find a way to communicate will can you understand what it is that

he looks almost protohuman
yes sir his dna would seem to confirm that observation captain i believe the crew is deevolving

this tranquilliser should keep him unconscious for another seven hours what have you found out
i have analysed commander rikers dna structure a synthetic tcell has invaded his genetic codes this tcell has begun to activate his latent introns
introns
they are genetic codes which are normally dormant they are evolutionary holdovers sequences of dna that provided key behavioural and physical characteristics millions of years ago but are no longer necessary for instance counsellor trois gill slits and other amphibious characteristics were derived from introns which still contain amphibious codes
so these introns are causing her dna to recombine in an earlier configuration
that is correct in her case the dna has created an amphibious lifeform which became extinct over fifty million years ago
and commander rikers introns are changing him into what appears to be one of the earlier hominids
yes sir i would say australopithecine each of these stages is another link in the evolutionary chain which stretches back to the origins of all lifeforms on earth because introns can include genetic material from many different species over millions of years of evolution it is possible that a wide variety of transformations is occurring among the crew
what about those crewmembers who are not from earth
all humanoid life has a similar genetic pattern the virus should work on nonhuman crewmembers in the same way they are each deevolving to earlier forms of life on their homeworlds i feel i must inform you sir you have also been infected by the intron virus
how long before i begin to change
according to my calculations within the next twelve hours you will begin to exhibit the first signs of your eventual transformation
and what will that be
i believe you will also deevolve into some form of early primate possibly similar to a lemur or a pygmy marmoset
well before i begin swinging through the ship looking for breakfast wed better find some answers how do we reverse the process
i am uncertain we will need to run several microcellular scans however the ships main computer has been damaged captain the computer in my quarters has an independent processing and memory storage unit it should not be affected i suggest we start from there
agreed


it would appear that spot has had her kittens
they sound hungry
yes i am curious as to why spot is not caring for them

it would seem the intron virus is not limited to humanoid lifeforms
no sir
what is it
these kittens were born less than twenty four hours it would appear that spots transformation took place at approximately the same time
so spot was giving birth to the kittens at the same time that she was changing into a reptilian lifeform
i believe so for some reason the intron virus was not passed on to the kittens i do not know why
if i remember my biology there are several natural immune systems that come into play in the mothers womb to protect the foetus from viral infections
that is true placental barrier maternal antibodies and amniotic fluids all serve as a filtration system
maybe we could have inhibited the intron virus by using the natural antibodies in spots amniotic fluid
it would take further research but i believe to be effective on humanoid crewmembers humanoid antibodies would be necessary
then we should locate a pregnant humanoid
nurse ogawa has recently became pregnant
where is she
i have traced her comm badge signal to deck seventeen section twenty one alpha
the arboretum

one of the warp plasma vents has failed main engineering has been abandoned there is no one there to fix the problem

i can repair the damaged plasma vent from here
im going to check the status of the warp core

data

what was that
i believe it was lieutenant barclay he appeared to be partially transformed into an arachnid
a spider
yes sir are you all right captain
i have these intense feelings of fear and panic i feel as if i were being watched i cant explain it
you may be experiencing the initial stages of your transformation early primates were often prey to larger carnivores as a result their instincts probably included a heightened sense of awareness
in that case my instincts tell me that wed better hurry


captain i have analysed nurse ogawas embryo it has been unaffected by the virus i believe i can use her amniotic fluid as a template for a retrovirus it would neutralise the synthetic tcell and reestablish the original genetic patterns of each host
how soon can you do that
it will not take long to isolate the appropriate genetic material i will need to get the sickbay computer back on

what was that
it is large approximately two hundred kilograms it is heavily armored with an exoskeleton life signs appear to be klingon
worf

set your phaser to heavy stun
we cannot be certain a stun setting will have any effect on him a higher setting may kill him

listen to that he sounds very angry really really aggressive what do you think he wants do you think hes responding to some predatory instinct do you think he see us as prey
there are crewmembers in the corridors and other sections of the ship it would be much easier for him to capture and consume one of them than to attempt to break through a door
then what does he want predators use vocalisations to frighten other predators and to mark territory and to commence mating process a mating process counsellor troi was bitten by a klingon but not in a place that might be lifethreatening nowhere near a major artery or organ data look at this look at this injury this wound was never intended to give her any kind of serious harm
captain what are you suggesting
is it possible that worf could see counsellor troi as his mate
if that is true he must be trying to reach her now
well we cant just leave we have to stay here and protect her and we have to keep on working on the retrovirus if we could distract him if we could lure him away from her
the mating instinct is quite strong in klingon biology i am not certain what would be an effective lure
klingons have got a very powerful sense of smell if we could duplicate deannas pheromones and then convince him shes no longer in sickbay that shed gone into some other part of the ship
i am extracting a blood sample from one of her sebaceous glands where the pheromones are produced i believe i can activate the pheromones with a bioactivant solution
can you amplify the pheromones they need to be much more powerful than deannas actual scent
i believe this will produce the desired effect i will use it to draw worf to a another part of the ship
no no no you must go on working on the retrovirus ill go
captain that is extremely unwise worf may be much faster than
no time no time to argue



deck seventeen deck seventeen



computer display progress of genetic resequencing



genetic resequencing in progress dna to seventy percent normal
computer increase nucleotide substitution by thirty two percent




data to captain picard

go ahead data
the retro virus is working sir

i can release it into the ships atmosphere in a gaseous state

however it will take some time to take effect
acknowledged

are you all right sir
yes im

fine mister data proceed  well mister worf lets hope that when you wake up youre a new man
captains log supplemental commander data has succeeded in returning the crew to normal doctor crusher has determined that the synthetic tcell she used to cure mister barclays urodelan flu initiated the intron virus which swept through the ship

so this is my fault
no in a way its mine i didnt realise it at the time but theres an anomaly in your genetic chemistry that caused the synthetic tcell to mutate instead of activating one dormant gene it started activating all of them including your introns
and thats what er and thats what caused me to devolve
you and every other member of the crew the tcell became airborne and started to spread like a virus you know reg this is a completely new disease and its traditional to classify a new disease with the name of the first diagnosed patient
oh you mean you want to name the disease after me
thats right how about barclays protomorphosis syndrome
barclays protomorphosis it has a nice ring to it thank you doctor

he transformed into a spider and now he has a disease named after him
i think id better clear my calendar for the next few weeks
journeys end

captains log stardate  the enterprise has arrived at starbase three one zero for a meeting with fleet admiral necheyev this visit will also give us the opportunity to pick up a member of the family

here you are your very own quarters theyre as far away from mine as possible so you dont even have to see me if you dont want to
mom you know thats not why i asked for my own quarters this time
you dont have to explain there comes a time in a young mans life when he doesnt want to stay with his poor senile mother i understand
ill come visit you in the old doctors home every sunday

come in
so is there a runaway cadet in here
if so we may have to call security
welcome back wes
thanks
so hows life at the academy
 its great its great but its good to have a break
i was of course not serious about calling security it was a joke
i got it data
so are you just going to lounge while we all have work to do around here
im sure i can find some time to help you sir
wes enjoy your vacation im sure youve earned it
thanks
well i think wed better let you settle in
yeah thats a good idea say wes dont sleep your whole vacation away all right
goodbye wes

its good to have you home son
thanks mom
really



admiral necheyev has just beamed aboard shes being escorted right here
good
earl grey tea watercress sandwiches and bularian canaps are you up for a promotion
i am trying to establish a new relationship with the admiral there has been a certain amount of tension between us in the past
tension is hardly the word id use
well i am trying to get things off on a better note this time i want to make her feel at ease i want her to feel that shes welcome aboard the enterprise
is there any reason she shouldnt feel welcome here
we dont have to like her will but we have to follow her orders and maintaining this atmosphere of confrontation serves no purpose

admiral necheyev welcome aboard the enterprise
thank you you may leave commander riker
thank you admiral captain

may i offer you some refreshment
ill come right to the point captain there is a situation thats developed on the cardassian border that  are those bularian canaps
as a matter of fact they are i spoke with your aide commander wrightwell and he said that you were particularly fond of them
that was very thoughtful captain thank you
please you were saying about the cardassians

yes the federation has just completed a very long and drawnout series of negotiations regarding the final status of our border with the cardassians these will be the official boundaries

i see
youll notice a demilitarised zone has also been created along the border neither side will be permitted to place military outposts conduct fleet exercises or station warships anywhere in the demilitarised area
this border places several federation colonies in cardassian territory and some cardassian colonies in ours
this agreement is far from perfect neither side got everything they wanted but every side got something and as someone once said diplomacy is the art of the possible those colonies finding themselves on the wrong side of the border will have to be moved
well the colonists are not going to be happy about that some of them have been there for decades
it wont be easy but its a reasonable price to pay for peace your mission will be to evacuate the colony on dorvan five
dorvan five isnt that where the group of north american indians settled
yes theyve been there for about twenty years theyve established a village in a small valley on the southern continent is something wrong
admiral centuries ago these north american indians were forcibly displaced from their ancestral lands these settlers on dorvan five originally left earth more than two hundred years ago in order to preserve their cultural identities
i am aware of that captain
you see admiral there are some very disturbing historical parallels here once more theyre being asked to leave their homes because of a political decision that has been taken by a distant government
an indian representative was included in the deliberations of the federation council his objections were noted discussed but ultimately rejected captain the indians on dorvan are a nomadic group that have settled there only twenty years ago and at that time they were warned that the planet was hotly disputed by the cardassians the bottom line is they never should have gone there in the first place
granted but to go to them now after twenty years later and ask them to leave what is now their home
i made that same argument with the federation council but it took three years to negotiate this treaty some concessions had to be made and this is one of them
what if these indians refuse to be evacuated
then your orders will be to remove them by whatever means are necessary i understand your moral objections captain if you wish i can find someone else to command the enterprise for this mission
that will not be necessary admiral
i dont envy you this task but i do believe it is for the greater good
i understand
and captain thank you for making me feel welcome
you will always be welcome aboard this ship admiral


thanks ensign hey wes there you are come here for a second ive got something i want to show you come on come on youve got to take a look at this now remember how we always used to talk about improving quantum efficiency by creating a new plasmadyne relay well take a look at this
youve only got one microfusion interrelay in there your converter interfacell never hold up
hey i ran these diagnostics myself this little baby will withstand over five hundred cochranes of warp field stress
i dont think so you better put a secondary phase inverter in there look at your subprocessor matrix it needs an overhaul
well that may be your opinion cadet but i stand by my work
read the latest paper from doctor vassbinder he has brilliant new theories on warp propulsion interrelays hes say all this stuff is obsolete
i dont know whats gotten into you wes
look do you want my help or not
with this kind of an attitude absolutely not youre dismissed
captains log supplemental the enterprise has arrived at dorvan five and i have spoken to the leader of the tribal council he has agreed to meet with us this afternoon to discuss the situation


anthwara theres very little i can do the decision about this planet was made at the very highest level of starfleet
 do you know how long we have searched for a home almost two hundred years then we found this world can you blame us for not wanting to give it up
i understand and i respect your peoples long journey but i believe that i can help you to find a new home
as you can see there are three other planets in this sector that have environmental conditions similar to those here on dorvan five theyre all uninhabited and could be colonised immediately
and if none of these worlds meet with your approval then well find you other choices
 you do not understand captain the choice of this world was not only because of environmental conditions there were other more intangible concerns as well when i came here twenty years ago i was welcomed by the mountains the rivers the sky
anthwara hes laughing at you he thinks youre talking about old superstition and nonsense
this is not true i have the deepest deal of respect for your beliefs and the meaning that they hold for your people
then you can respect the fact that this planet holds a deep spiritual significance for us it has taken us two centuries to find this place we do not want to spend another two hundred years searching for what we already have
captain i suggest we adjourn allow us all time to think about whats been said
agreed we will reconvene tomorrow
and in the meantime i would like to invite you all to join us this evening on the enterprise
thank you we look forward to it

ever since youve come on board youve been moody sullen and rude whats going on
nothing i just want to be left alone
that incident in engineering was inexcusable
that is my business i dont need you telling me how to behave
i shouldnt have to youre a fourth year starfleet cadet you should have a certain level of maturity
maybe i am sick of following rules and regulations maybe i am sick of living up to everyone elses expectations did you ever think of that

i have been fascinated looking into the history and traditions of your people and i was very interested to learn that your grandfather katowa was the man who first led the group of indians from earth initially more than two hundred years ago
there was great deal of opposition even my own father was against it but when katowa made his decision it was final my father never said another word
its never easy to leave ones home the safe and the familiar but there are times when the greater good demands that certain sacrifices are made im sure that was something that your grandfather understood
so does his grandson there are also times when a people sacrificed too much when a people must hold on to what we have even against overwhelming opposition what do you know about your family captain
well a great deal actually my father was a strong believer in passing on the traditions and history of the family
i would like to know more about your family we have very strong ties to our ancestors we believe their actions guide us even now knowing more about your family might help me to better understand you besides it is always good to understand ones adversary in any negotiation
i hope that by the end of this matter you will no longer look at me as an adversary my family well our roots in western europe go back to the time of charlemagne
im sorry im late
well talk about it later

wesley crusher
yes
i am lakanta
its nice to meet you can i get you a drink or something
i have known that you were coming to us for the past two years two years ago i went into the habak and began a vision quest while i was there i saw many things talked to many animals many spirits and i saw you
i dont think i understand
i know why you came to us wesley to find the answers that you seek

i just dont know what to do jeanluc its as if somebody took my son away and left this stranger in his place
but in a sense thats exactly what happened wesley left the enterprise three years ago he was a boy and now hes returned a young man and that cant be easy for a mother or a son
its gone beyond just the two of us
yes i heard about the incident with geordi
have you heard what happened at the academy i called admiral brand today she said his grades are dropping that hes becoming remote and defensive if hes not careful hes going to wash out next term maybe you should talk to him jeanluc maybe its the kind of thing a boy a man needs to discuss with another man
i dont think he wants either of us to talk to him right now
but he needs out help
beverly hes got to want that help if he doesnt then any efforts on our part can only push him further away hes got to work this out for himself

how long have you been watching me
since you beamed down
well im here what should i do
i dont know
i thought you were going to help me find some answers
answers to your questions
tell me about this habak you said you had some kind of a vision there
the habak is holy to us we hold our rituals and our ceremonies there its sacred to us whats sacred to you wesley
i dont know i mean i think a lot of things are important i have a lot of respect for things but i dont really consider anything sacred
look around us what do you think is sacred to us here
maybe the necklace youre wearing the designs on the walls
everything is sacred to us the buildings the food the sky the dirt beneath your feet and you whether you believe in your spirit or not we believe in it you are a sacred person here wesley
i think thats the first time anyones used that particular word to describe me
so if you are sacred then you must treat yourself with respect to do otherwise is to desecrate something that is holy
is that what you think ive been doing
only you can decide that
i guess i havent had a lot of respect for myself lately
then perhaps its time for your own vision quest to begin

anthwara i deeply regret that we have not been able to reach an agreement but and i must be blunt i cannot take no for an answer this planet will be handed over to the cardassian government in accordance with the terms of the border agreement i am very sorry but you will have to leave
and if we do not
then i will be forced to remove you by whatever means are necessary
we know you will not take us from this land captain
i may regret doing it but i am not able
when you first came to us we did not know why you were sent by the federation but we knew there must be a good reason to us nothing that happens is truly random so we searched for the true reason you were sent we did not find it until last night are you familiar with the pueblo revolt of sixteen eighty
i am several indian tribes rose up to overthrow their spanish overlords and drove them out of what is now called new mexico
ten years later the spanish returned to reconquer the area they were brutal i would use the word savage they killed hundreds of our people thousands more were maimed the name of one of the soldiers was javier maribonapicard your ancestor
im not aware of this incident or of the man you named and this happened seven hundred years ago i do not see what bearing it can have
that is why you have come to us to erase a stain of blood worn by your family for twenty three generations

mister worf what is going on
we have unwelcome visitors sir

im captain jeanluc picard of the enterprise
i am gul evek what are all these people still doing here the evacuation should be well underway by now
may i have a word with you alone
as you wish wait here
it was my understanding that there would be no cardassian presence here for another six weeks your arrival here may have upset some very delicate negotiations
negotiations the status of this planet has been settled what are you negotiating
i would be very happy to explain that to you but for now i must ask you and your men to leave immediately
captain we have been sent here to perform a preliminary survey of all the buildings and equipment being left behind i have no intention of leaving until our mission is complete
very well complete your mission but remember this is federation territory gul evek and until that changes these people are under my jurisdiction and i will protect them
is that a threat
its a fact bear that in mind while you conduct your survey


this is the habak the focal point of our lives strangers are not welcome here
when i asked to come here you said it would be
youre not a stranger i told you ive seen you here before
what are those figures
they are mansara dolls that represent the different spirits that come to this place
this one looks like a klingon
yes our culture is rooted in the past but its not limited to the past

the spirits of the klingon the vulcan the ferengi come to us just as the bear and the coyote and the parrot theres no difference
what should i do
start the fire then sit and wait
what am i waiting for
this is your journey wesley i can open the door but only you can go through it

admiral the indian councils is adamant they refuse to leave dorvan five
is there any indication that the tribal council will change their position in the near future
no sir
then i see no other choice
admiral i have every reason to believe that they will resist any attempt to remove them i strongly urge you to request an emergency session of the federation council the issue of dorvan five must be reopened
captain i made that request two days ago the answer was no im sorry but you have your orders starfleet out
so much for your reprieve from starfleet
anthwara believes that i am responsible for the crimes of one of my ancestors against his people
do you believe that
no of course not i respect his belief but i do not see how it can have any bearing on this mission but even so i cant help wondering if a dark chapter in my familys history is about to be repeated if those people take up arms against us then i cannot foresee the consequences mister worf will you come in here for a moment
aye sir

mister worf will you begin preparations to remove the inhabitants from dorvan five
aye sir




wesley
dad
youve reached the end wesley
the end of what
this journey the one you started a long time ago when i left you and your mother
you mean when you died
you set out on a journey that wasnt your own now its time to find a path that is truly yours dont follow me any further
i dont understand
yes you do its just hard for you to accept goodbye wesley and good luck
dad wait



mister crusher are you all right
yeah worf im fine
 lay out a confinement beam trace along the southeastern side of the village be discreet we do not wish to alarm these people
yes sir
worf what are you doing
we are laying out transporter coordinates for a security perimeter it may be necessary to remove these people by force
worf we cant do this these people deserve better than to be removed from their homes
i understand but now is not the time or the place to
 do you know what theyre trying to do theyre preparing to beam you away and take you to their ship youre not going to let them do that are you
no we wont leave now

inexcusable you defied the orders of the ranking officer on the scene you put the lives of the entire away team in jeopardy and you made an already tense situation worse your actions reflect very badly on this ship and on that uniform now i want an explanation mister crusher and i want it now
what youre doing down there is wrong these people are not some random group of colonists theyre a unique culture with a history that predates the federation and starfleet
that does not alter the fact that my orders are to
i know admiral necheyev gave you an order and she was given an order from the federation council but its still wrong
that decision is not yours to make cadet i dont know what has got into you lately and frankly right now i dont care but i will tell you this while you wear that uniform you will obey every order youre given and you will conform to starfleet regulations and rules of conduct is that clear
yes sir it is but i wont be wearing this uniform any longer im resigning from the academy

riker to captain
go ahead number one
gul evek wants to meet with you to discuss the situation on the surface
let him come aboard ill see him in here
aye sir


why are you doing this
i told you starfleet isnt for me
look i may not be able to stop you from throwing away your entire life but you are going to stand here and explain it to me first you owe me that much
i saw dad today he told me not to follow him
you what
i was participating in an indian ritual and i had a vision dad came to me and told me not to follow him he said i had to find my own path
is that what this is all about a vision told you to leave the academy and now youre packing your bags
no no its more than that ive known ive needed to do this for a long time i just havent been able to admit it to myself
but you always said that being at the academy was the best thing that ever happened to you
i know for a while it was but as time went on and graduation got closer i started feeling really depressed i thought maybe it was the workload or the stress of being away from home but it didnt go away it just got worse
why didnt you ever say anything
i didnt want to disappoint you or captain picard or my friends you guys were all so proud of me
id be proud of you no matter what you were doing wesley i love you
i know mom i guess the truth is that i was afraid of disappointing myself i never questioned the fact that id be in starfleet but when dad said not to follow him it just made so much sense everything is so clear now
maybe it is partly my fault we didnt realised the kind of pressure we were putting on you to be exactly what we expected you to be
i dont blame you at all it is my decision it always has been
you know that alien from tau ceti the one who could control warp fields with his mind
the traveller
he told captain picard a long time ago that you were very special like mozart and that you were destined for something quite different from the rest of us maybe this is the first step i love you
i love you too mom

you shouldnt be here wesley
why

get down
bring them over here
why have you taken these men prisoner
this is not their world they have no right to be here
the terms of the treaty gives them the right to survey this planet
we dont recognise that treaty
worf to picard an armed group of indians has taken two cardassian prisoners the situation is extremely volatile

request instructions
stand by mister worf have your ship lock on to your people and beam them out of there before something happens
my people what about these indians of yours theyve taken hostages this is our planet captain we will not be chased away by some unruly crowd gul evek to the vetar
this is glin telak aboard the vetar go ahead
two of our men on the surface have been taken prisoner prepare to send an armed squad of troopers to rescue them and to occupy the village
gul evek those people are federation citizens and i am sworn to protect them if your troops attack that village my security forces will respond
i hope you realise the consequences of federation officers firing on cardassian troops
oh yes i do that is why we must to stop this now before its too late

i cannot allow you to hold these men as prisoners
you have no authority here

no

what happened did you do this
i didnt do anything you did
i did
you pulled yourself out of their time you took the first step wesley
my first step to where
to another plane of existence another way of thinking
i dont understand
youve found a new beginning for yourself the first step on a journey that few humans will ever take
who are you  the traveller
ive been waiting a long time for this moment wesley
so all those things i saw in the habak my father and the things he said to me that was your doing
i merely opened the door for you what you experienced came from your own mind your own spirit if you wish i hoped that you would open your mind to new possibilities and you did you pulled yourself out of time dont you see youve evolved to a new level youre ready to explore places where thought and energy combine in ways you cant even imagine and i will be your guide if you would like
what about them i cant just leave them like this
they must find their own destinies wesley its not our place to interfere
but
have faith in their abilities to solve their problems on their own


the cardassian ship is powering its weapons and its transporters
this is the vetar to gul evek our troops are under attack theyre requesting immediate assistance what are your orders
evek the last war caused massive destruction and cost millions of lives dont send our two peoples back down that same path again not like this now the future lies in your hands right now give us one last chance for peace
gul evek what are your orders can we open fire
evek to the vetar lock on to our troops on the surface and beam them aboard
but sir theyve been fired upon
those are my orders carry them out
yes sir
beam up the away team immediately
aye sir
i lost two of three sons in the war captain i dont want to lose the last one

anthwara i want to make absolutely sure that you understand the implications of this agreement by giving up your status as federation citizens any future request you or your people make to starfleet will go unanswered you will be on your own and under cardassian jurisdiction
i understand captain and we are prepared to take that risk will the cardassian government honour your agreement here
i believe i can convince them that this is an equitable solution i cannot speak for every cardassian you may encounter but if you leave us alone i suspect that we will do the same will this be acceptable to the starfleet command
it will not be easy but with admiral necheyevs support i think they will go along with it in the end
then if theres nothing else i will return to my ship i have a rather long report to write captain anthwara

i was right captain you did not take us from our land and you have wiped clean a very old stain of blood
captains log stardate  the enterprise is preparing to leave dorvan five but former cadet wesley crusher will be staying behind

where will you go
the traveller said that my studies would begin with these people he said that theyre aware of many things i can learn a lot from them thats just what i need more studying
somehow i think youll manage
me too
well good luck mister good luck wesley
thank you for a lot of things

now you be sure and dress warmly on those other planes of existence
i will bye mom
goodbye
energise
firstborn



as time passes a boy inevitably becomes a man what is not inevitable is that a man become a warrior a warrior must be forged like a sword tempered by by  tempered by experience the path of the warrior begins

alexander
no wait

sorry i didnt mean to hit you

what is the meaning of this
im sorry we made fullerenes in chemistry class today and filled them with water
i asked you to meet me here after school i have been waiting for you
i forgot
you forgot because you allowed yourself to be distracted by foolishness
im sorry
there is something very important i want to discuss with you it concerns your future sit as time passes a boy inevitably becomes a man but what is not inevitable is that a man become a sword
what
no i meant warrior the path of a warrior begins with the first rite of ascension
is that when they hit you with pain sticks
no no that is the second rite
oh
you are approaching the age of ascension it is time for you to prepare for the ceremony
what do i have to do
well your fighting skills will be tested and your knowledge of the teachings of kahless it will be challenging but i will help you prepare these are the kortova candles they represent the fire that burns within the heart of a warrior when you light yours you will be declaring your intention to become a warrior go ahead
what if i dont want to
if you do not participate in the rite before the age of thirteen years you will never be able to become a true klingon warrior
well i dont care about that
you may not care about it now but someday you might
mother always said that i didnt have to do any of this klingon stuff if i didnt want
it is your decision but
okay then im not going to do it
alexander
you just said it was up to me i dont want to be a warrior

as a result we wont be able to rendezvous with the kearsarge for another four days
will we be holding position here until it arrives
yes and as it would seem were in for a relatively quiet time i shall use this opportunity to visit the hatarian system there are some ancient ruins that are just being excavated
the delay will also make it possible for stellar dynamics to complete their study of the vodrey nebula
ill let them know they can have more access to the lateral sensor grid
we could use this time to recalibrate the weapon targeting array mister worf
 yes sir i will begin the procedure immediately
very good dismissed lieutenant could i have a word with you for a moment

i noticed several times during the briefing that you appeared to be a bit distracted
i apologise in the future i will make sure my personal affairs do not interfere with my duties
is everything all right
i am having problems with alexander he has made it clear he does not wish to participate in the first rite of ascension
oh i see
i have tried to tell him that it is an important part of a young klingons life but he does not understand
but hes had so little opportunity to spend time with klingons you know the festival of kotbaval is tomorrow if he could take part in that im sure he would more fully appreciate what a rich cultural heritage he comes from there is the klingon outpost on maranga four im sure theyll be celebrating the festival
yes but the outpost is on the other side of the vodrey nebula it would take three days by shuttle to get there
the enterprise could be there in a fraction of the time and still be back in time for the rendezvous
captain i cannot ask you
mister worf stellar dynamics would like nothing better than a trip around the nebula
thank you sir


whos that
it is the tyrant molor he was so strong no one could stand against him
noktar begot hoshar tenot
whats he saying
he is asking if anyone else will have the courage to stand up to molor
noktar begot hoshar tenot
 kirok molor kirok
nitokor bakto bajak tumo

otak turo

noktar begot hoshar tenot

kirok molor kirok
what is this

jikta you have wounded me
you fought well
what happens now
there is only one man can stand against molor
noktar kahless
its kahless
kahless would rather die than live under molors tyranny
nilot kahless


father
where have you been
we were watching the fire dancers
we
knor and barel they live here on the outpost i need some money
what for
the man over there says hes got molors head in a box the real molor
that is impossible the real molor died centuries ago
i know its mummified he offered to show us for fifty darseks
he is trying to take your money
please father hes waiting
no it is late we should go home
but

alexander that is enough come it is time to go
i have to say goodbye to my friends
you can see your friends again tomorrow
were coming back
if you want to

hijak beh

run alexander

nitokor bakto

qapla worf you are too much for them
i have seen you before who are you
a friend

are you kmtar
your brother sent me here to protect you

he is gintak to the house of mogh
gintak
an advisor so trusted that he is become part of a family
do you have any idea who was behind the attack
it is a klingon matter it is not your concern
one of my officers was almost killed that makes it my concern
recently rumours began to circulate on the homeworld that an assassination attempt was going to be made on the family of mogh kurn sent me here to make sure nothing happened to worf
why didnt you warn him before the attack was made
i tried to contact him over subspace i was told he was not aboard i decided to beam directly to the surface
why didnt you let us know about it
forgive me for being blunt commander but when it comes to protecting the house to which i have pledged my life i trust no one
i have full confidence in the officers with whom i serve one of the attackers dropped this dagger the design represents the house of duras
we have other evidence that indicates the duras sisters lursa and betor were behind the attack
what do you think they were after
kurns seat on the council of course
we can not allow their attack on our house to go unanswered
first we must to find them
at one point they were at deep space nine trying to sell bilitrium explosives
that was months ago no one knows where they went from there
maybe we can find them weve arranged for quarters on the ship if youd like to stay
i would worf and i have much to discuss

i will send kurn a message telling him what happened but he will not receive it for days hes gone to the hitora colony
why did you treat commander riker so disrespectfully you were rude
i may have been rude by human standards i meant no disrespect what is the matter worf have you been living so long among humans that you have forgotten how klingons behave
i have not forgotten i am merely stating that their ways our different than ours
i trust you have made your son aware of that fact as well
yes of course i have
good because someday alexander may be called upon to lead the house of mogh kurn has no male heir he wants to make sure that alexander is preparing himself
does my brother doubt my ability to raise my son as a klingon
no but you are alone among humans it cannot be easy to keep our ways
no it has not been easy
how are his fighting skills can he handle a batleth
he is learning he could be better
he must hes nearing the age of ascension
actually alexander has not yet committed himself to undergoing the rite
what
i have tried to explain to him how important it is but he will not listen to me
perhaps together you and i can find a way to spark the boys interest in his heritage
i would be grateful for any help you could offer
tomorrow then
tomorrow
may i say goodnight to the boy
yes of course


is this your mother
yes she died when i was little
you miss her a great deal dont you it must be hard for you being the only klingon your age aboard this ship
sometimes
have you ever been to the homeworld
no
i think you would like it there at your uncles house there is a lake you can swim in that is so clear you can see all the way to the bottom
really
you have cousins there they want to meet you
i dont know
i understand youre afraid you dont whether the homeworld is safe
yes
what happened today on the planet is frightening youre still troubled
i thought they were going to kill my father
you must have wanted to help us fight them off
i didnt know what to do
someday if you work hard you will become a warrior a klingon warrior and you will always feel safe because you will know how to defend yourself and ill tell you something else if anyone ever tries to hurt your father again you will be able to fight at his side and make sure nothing happens to him what do you think of that goodnight alexander dream well
good night kmtar


any luck
starfleet records contain no mention of the duras sisters after their departure from deep space nine
did i not tell you as much
have you been able to contact deep space nine
i am being patched through right now sir
on screen quark i see you remember me
how could i forget the only man ever to win triple down dabo at one of my tables
and how could i forget that you didnt have enough latinum to cover my winnings
i thought i explained that my brother had misplaced the key to the safe besides those vouchers i gave you are every bit as good as latinum
not exactly you can spend latinum just about anywhere those vouchers are only good at your bar
is that what this is about youre on your way and youre calling to reserve a holosuite programme
actually i was hoping you could help me with something else
what would that be
im looking for some klingon friends of mine the duras sisters lursa and betor
yes lursa and betor big talk small tips
do you know where i can find them
well i did hear a rumour actually
what kind of rumour
oh i dont know im sure it was told to me in confidence
and how much would your confidence cost
how many vouchers do you have again
i have enough for twelve bars of latinum id be glad to return them
i believe the rumour was that the sisters were trying to buy some second hand mining equipment
what for
they learned of a magnesite deposit on the kalla system it belongs to the pakleds but those fools dont even know its there your er friends tried to get at it
all right ill send those vouchers to you
dont bother i voided them while weve been talking
so long quark

how long would it take us to get to the kalla system
approximately sixteen hours sir
could not he have been lying
why would he id just be knocking on his door again in a few days and i wouldnt be in as good a mood
congratulations commander i did not think it would be possible to find the sisters
take us out of orbit
aye sir


i took the liberty of creating a holodeck programme
what kind of programme
ill show you computer run programme kmtar alpha one
programme initiated enter when ready

why did you want to recreate this
you said you wished you had been able to help your father fight but you did not know how you have probably fought that battle over and over again in your mind
yes
lets see what happens now

computer give me two klingon warriors
how can i fight someone that big
size is not the most important thing skill cunning powers of observation are the most important weapons nitokor bakto

freeze programme look what this kotal is doing you see his leg that will give a clue as to what his next move will be
all his weight is on his right foot
yes he is going to have to shift it to regain his balance
stand ready computer resume programme

potajg potajg finish him

freeze programme you should have killed him when you had the chance
why did you not
i dont know
look at him he did not care that you showed him mercy he was going to kill you
kmtar that is enough
if this was real hed be dead by now

alexander

we are approaching kalla three
set a standard orbit any evidence of a mining expedition
a shaft has been cut through the outer crust there is evidence of machinery but it does not appear to be in use
life signs
it is difficult to say the magnesite is interfering with bioreadings
assemble an away team

who are you
gorta i am gorta
what are you doing on this planet
i crashed here
then you are denying involvement in illegal mining activities
mining so thats what all this equipment is here for
we are looking for two klingon women sisters
lursa betor do you know where they are
actually we were hoping that you did
maybe i do
would you be willing to share your information with us
my personal code of conduct prohibits sharing but id consider a trade
does your personal code of conduct tell you that when youre stranded on a planet with no way off you shouldnt try to cut deals
you have a point
we could certainly provide passage off this planet in exchange for information
could you perhaps fail to tell the pakleds that we were mining their ore
dont push your luck but if you get us to the duras sisters ill see what i can do
the duras sisters they are magnificent arent they
where are they now
selling the ore i imagine they took everything the ore the ship
and where have they gone
we were going to sell the ore to a yridian trader we were supposed to meet him in the ufandi system
gather your belongings it is time to leave
like i said they took everything

worf i am sorry about what happened i should not have gotten so angry its just that i am worried about alexander
as am i
kurn told me that his mother actively discouraged him exploring his klingon heritage
when he first came to live with me he knew nothing of our ways he often reminds me of things his mother said to him i try not to disregard her wishes i want the boy to honour his mother
someday im sure he will appreciate you and be grateful for all that you have given him but still compared to other boys his age his fighting skills are years behind
yes i know he does not put in the time it takes to learn the skills
i thought that you might consider sending him to the training academy on ogat your brother is an influential man im sure he could see to it that alexander was admitted
ogat
i am only thinking of what is best for the boy there he would learn our ways he would live like a klingon
i would like him to learn our ways no this is his home
how can you expect him to lead our family when all he knows is life aboard a federation starship
he is my son he belongs with me
the boy is more human than klingon if he stays here he will never be a warrior he will never be able to defend our family against its enemies
enough enough enough the decision is mine
not necessarily i would be well within my rights to invoke yanora kor
you would question my fitness to raise my own son
for the good of our house yes worf i beg of you please stop thinking of yourself it is alexander we should be considering look into your heart and do what is best for him

kahless was determined to teach his brother a lesson because he had told a lie but morath refused to fight him and instead ran away kahless pursued him across the valleys over the mountains and down to the edge of the sea and there on the shore they fought for
twelve days twelve nights i know ive heard this story before
alexander it is important to tell these stories even if we already know them
why was kahless so mad about the lie his brother told
it made him look like a coward
if kahless would have just explained what happened maybe they wouldnt have had to fight about it
youre missing the point
why was it so wrong for morath to run away maybe he didnt want to fight his brother because he didnt want to have to kill him
he ran because he was a coward
but how do you know thats why
no more questions these are our stories it is important for a warrior to learn how to interpret them properly
im trying to
no your head is filled with foolish human notions about the way things are you are klingon it is time you began to act like one
i am part human too
listen to me alexander when a human looks at you he does not see himself he sees a klingon
it doesnt matter what i look like
it does you are different than everyone else aboard this ship
thats not true
it is the only way that you will ever feel as if you truly belong is to leave here and go live with your own kind i know a klingon school you could go to you would be welcome there they would teach you how to be a warrior prepare you for the rite of ascension
i dont know if i want to do that
after you were there a while you would find that you wouldnt want to do anything else
i dont want to leave the enterprise
alexander you must everything depends on it
i thought you were different i thought you understood me but you dont youre just like my father all you care about is me becoming a warrior just leave me alone
first officers log stardate  weve entered the ufandi system where we believe the duras sisters might have come to sell the ore they mined on kalla three

i am detecting a vessel holding position near the third planet it is a yridian freighter
put it on screen scan for magnesite in its hold
the resonance signature indicates that there is magnesite ore present
then were too late the sisters have already been here
somehow i doubt the yridians are going to be forthcoming about where they might have gone
sir readings indicate that there are only five hundred kilograms of ore in the yridian hold
there should be over ten thousand kilograms
thats odd hail them im commander william riker from the federation starship enterprise
i am yog why are we speaking
our sensors indicate that youre carrying magnesite ore
magnesite yes
where did you get it
from a corvallen for a good price
where is this corvallen now im under orders to acquire some magnesite
he is gone where who is to know
would you be interested in selling me the ore youre carrying
no i have a buyer
you havent heard my offer half a gram of anjoran biomimetic gel
done
once we verify the purity of your ore well beam over the gel

youre up to something
have the transporter room beam the ore to these coordinates
sir that would place the ore directly off the ships starboard bow
i know
transport complete
lock phasers on the ore and fire
firing

a klingon bird of prey
put a tractor beam on it
how did you know
the yridians had only part of the shipment in their hold i realised we had arrived before they had completed the transfer
the klingon ship is hailing us
on screen
release our vessel at once
i dont think so
weve done nothing wrong we were engaging in a simple business transaction
we know youre dealing in stolen ore but i want to talk about the assassination attempt on lieutenant worf
what assassination attempt this is the first ive heard of it
too bad it didnt succeed
we have evidence that youre behind it
that is outrageous
what is this evidence
beam over well show you
well be there shortly

this was dropped by one of the assassins it bears the crest of your house
geko kafla
someone must have given it to the assassins to implicate us
why would someone do that
in order to tarnish our good name
you cannot tarnish a rusted blade
jiko toval
girnak tovosor
mister worf you said there was other evidence they were involved
yes on the homeworld
well set a course i want this thing cleared up
i will send a message to kurn he may wish to return to the homeworld as well

betala nogtor
impossible
what is it
these markings represent the members of our house this symbol represents our father myself my sister and this represents her son
i was not aware you had a son
i do not but i am with child
she found out only a few days ago and told no one but me how can this marking be here where did this come from
i will speak with kmtar


father stop i am your son i am alexander
what are you saying
i am your son alexander i have come to this time from forty years in the future
ptak tell me the truth or i will kill you
look at me when we first met you said i looked familiar
i could have seen you on the homeworld
no look closely i am your son
if you are alexander you will remember your mothers last words before she died
i was three years old she was dying when we found her she barely managed to whisper my name and then she took my hand and placed it in yours then she died and then you howled in rage and said look upon her look upon death and always to remember and i always have

how have you done this come to this time
i met a man in the cambra system he gave me a chance to change the past he had the ability to send me here to this time
and you came here in order to end your own life
i was hoping that i would not have to that i could change things that i could change myself but i could not and now everything is going to turn out like it did before i cannot let that happen
but why what is going to happen that is so terrible
you will be killed because i was naive too weak to be able to protect you
i do not believe that
i was there i saw you murdered i was to blame
you must not blame yourself
you dont understand i did not become a warrior i was a diplomat a peacemaker when it came my time to lead our family i thought that i could single handedly end the fighting between the great houses i publicly announced that the house of mogh would be the first to end the feuding that there would be no more retribution no more revenge you tried to warn me you tried to tell me that i should not show weakness but i thought you were a foolish old man i told you that you were a relic from an earlier time and that a new era of peace was at hand but you were right my enemies saw my weakness and moved against me and unless i stop it right now that boy will see his father killed on the floor of the council chamber
that is why you wanted to take alexander away to turn him into a warrior
i staged the assassination attempt to try and frighten him to make him realise that he must follow the ways of the warrior if i had listened to you if i had become the warrior that you had wanted me to be you would not have died in my arms
no who knows what the future will be now that you have disrupted time i may die tomorrow or i may outlive you but when i die i would like an honourable death and the only way that is possible is for you accept yourself as you are and stay true to what you believe the cause of peace is a just cause the struggle must continue
it is a futile struggle i cannot change things
you have already changed things more than you realise
the boy i was has not changed
but i have you have given me a glimpse into my sons future and i know now that he has his own destiny and i believe it will be a great one
i love you father
and i you alexander


ive been waiting wheres kmtar
he had to leave he was called away
he never said goodbye
he asked me to say goodbye for him he also wanted me to tell you no matter what happens no matter what you decide to do with your life he will always care for you a great deal
when will i see him again
it may be a long time
well we should start practice
alexander there will be plenty of time for training
bloodlines


report
theres an object of some kind closing in on our position
on screen
it appears to be an unmanned probe approximately one half metre in diameter there are no identifiable armaments
captain we are being you are being hailed by name
open a channel this is captain jeanluc picard
captain i am reading a power surge
shields up
the beam appears to contain holographic imaging information
its trying to project something
isolate the bandwidth let the signal through the shields

bok
i trust you remember me picard because i havent forgotten you or how you murdered my son for fifteen years now ive thought about how to avenge his death but nothing i could do to you could equal what you did to me until now you thought you could hide him from me didnt you but i found out about him jason vigo is as good as dead im going to kill your son picard just like you killed mine

mister worf put a tractor beam on that probe determine if its safe to beam it aboard i want to know where it came from mister data see if there is any mention of a jason vigo in federation records you might start with miranda vigo she was born on new gaul about fifty years ago
aye sir
number one contact the ferengi government find out all you can about bok he was wearing a daimons uniform if hes regained his rank i want to know why

come
the ferengi government is debating an amendment to the rules of acquisition it could be a while before we hear from them data found out that the woman you mentioned has a son named jason this is the most recent picture we could find
how old is the boy now
twenty three he and his mother left earth twelve years ago they settled on camor five thats all we know the planets records are virtually nonexistent
picard to bridge set a course for the camor system warp five
aye sir
will i do appreciate your not asking but i do think that you have a right to know there is a possibility that the boy is my son i was involved with his mother for a short time about twenty four years ago we met through a friend when i was on shore leave on earth it was all very romantic very intense probably because we both knew i would be leaving in two weeks and we kept in touch for a while but we never managed to get together again
she never said anything to you about being pregnant
no so either bok is wrong and im not the father or miranda decided to raise the child alone which quite frankly wouldnt surprise me she was very independent very strong willed
she would have to be to get by on camor five
but whether hes my son or not hes in danger bok tried to kill me six years ago and i dont doubt he will try to make good his threat against the boy


anything
there are no ferengi vessels within range of our scanners
captain i am unable to find any information on jason vigos current whereabouts
what about his mother
no sir
miranda was trained as a botanist she always used to talk about running a farm one day maybe we should concentrate on the agricultural areas
that would significantly narrow our search the only cultivated land is on the southern continent and there are relatively few people engaged in agricultural activities
there cannot be many noncamorites among them scan for human life signs
i am detecting eight humans three are female however they are all too young to be miranda vigo
what about males
one is an infant another is elderly two are middle aged
thats seven you said there were eight
i am having difficulty getting a clear reading on the eighth the individual appears to be approximately two kilometres beneath the planets surface
male or female
male between twenty and thirty years old
no one in their right mind would go that far underground alone
unless he were forced to
captain i am reading seismic instability in the area he is in danger
relay his coordinates to the transporter room have them beam him aboard
aye sir


what the this is a federation ship
thats right im captain picard jeanluc picard
i realise i wasnt supposed to be spelunking that cave but dont you have something better to do
we thought you were at risk
oh well i wasnt so maybe you should just beam me back where i was
are you jason vigo
i er i know him is he in trouble
in a manner of speaking someone has made a threat against his life jason im an old friend of your mothers im here because youre in danger
why would anybody want to kill me
the person who has made the threat is under the impression that you are my son
am i
i dont know
my mother never told me who my father was just that he was in starfleet
maybe we should contact her
she died a few years ago
oh im sorry jason i think its important that we find out one way or another would you be willing to permit a genetic test
if im not your son is this person still going to want to kill me
i doubt it
in that case you wont mind my saying that i hope youre not my father


what were you doing in the caves jason are you a seismologist
no i just enjoy climbing
without an antigrav harness
no they get in the way
so what do you do
im between jobs right now
i see
excuse me gentlemen the test results are ready if youd like to hear them your genetic code is a cross between the dna of your mother miranda vigo and your father jeanluc picard

whats all this
oh theses are archaeological fragments that ive collected over the years this is a silvan glyph stone and this this is a gorlan prayer stick its really quite rare
is it valuable
not really only to students of archaeology such as myself though i did have to hand over a bottle of very old saurian brandy for it
id say you got taken
perhaps but its of value to me nonetheless
on camor something has value if you can eat it or sell it everything else is luxury
would you like some tea
no thanks
something else
no
tea earl grey hot im sure this whole thing is as much a surprise to you as it is to me i really want to be honest with you jason i only knew your mother for a very short time i would have liked to have known her better it just didnt work out that way you look a lot like her you know its the eyes i think i would like to make one thing clear jason your mother never told me about you if she had i would have been part of your life
maybe thats not what she wanted i think id like to go back to the surface now
i think it would be better if you stayed on board the enterprise until we have resolved this situation with bok
what is the situation with bok anyway why does he want me dead
years ago i was forced to destroy a starship commanded by his son bok apparently feels that it would be fitting vengeance to kill my son
i cant hide forever
of course not we are trying to locate bok now i want to confront him settle this matter
how long is this going to take
i assure you there is no one more eager to put this behind us than i am
where do i stay
well get you some quarters
okay lets go
jason your being here i hope it will give us the chance to get to know each other

we managed to shut down the probes power systems so we could beam it aboard its not going to be easy to figure out where this thing came from
bok took the precaution of encrypting the probes navigational systems so that we would be unable to decipher its flight path
we ran an analysis of the probes hull from the energy signatures and particle deposits we found it looks like it travelled through a dichromic nebula was exposed to an intensive gravimetric distortion and passed within one light year of a class four pulsar
those phenomena are relatively common we would need to identify at least one of them specifically in order to postulate a flight path
understood
captain incoming message from daimon birta
put it on screen thank you for taking the time to talk to us daimon
i understand you have a problem
yes it concerns daimon bok
bok is no daimon he was relieved of command six years ago he was unstable dangerous we had to confine him to rog prison
but hes no longer there
he was able to buy himself out about two years ago
i see do you know his whereabouts now
i understand he was seen in the dorias cluster not too long ago
but that cluster consists of more than twenty star systems
you dont have to thank me captain

believe it or not captain that mightve given us the fix we needed theres a nebula in the dorias cluster that matches the same particle signature we found on the probe
there is a class four pulsar three light years from the nebula my calculations indicate the probe was launched in the xendi kabu system
plot a course take us out of orbit

jeanluc come in
i think i need to talk to a parent
so whats he like
im not sure that i can tell you he puts up so many barriers i have no idea whats underneath
keep in mind hes had twenty years to be angry that his father wasnt there its going to take some time to get over those feelings but i do think its possible
perhaps but surely it would be wrong to force the issue my sense is that hes a very independent young man perhaps it would be best if i left him alone let him come to me if he wants to
maybe youre right but i think you should consider this are you doing the best thing for jason or whats easiest for you


yeah
hello jason im deanna troi ships counsellor
come in did captain picard ask you to come talk to me
no i just thought id come and see how you were doing a lots happened in the last few hours i thought you might like to talk about it
ill be all right people have wanted to kill me before
but youve never met your father before
and i have to admit i never thought i would
it must be somewhat overwhelming
im a little shaky
well thats only natural
but you know what i feel better already just talking to you
so how did you feel about the captain about your father
hes okay a little stiff but where are you from
i was born on betazed
do all the women there have eyes like yours
look jason i came here to talk to you because im the ships counsellor if you dont want to talk to me in that way then i think i should go
fine
youre welcome to make an appointment to come by my office
maybe ill do just that


picard can you hear me

i will kill him picard and theres nothing you can do about it
security to captains quarters immediately


our shields were up how could he have beamed through them
im not sure he did sensors dont show any sign of an intruder
could it have been another hologram
i dont think so captain something has to generate a hologram we would have detected it
bok once used a mind control device to make me hallucinate
that device emitted a very specific energy signature im not reading anything like that
could he have modified the device so he could use it without being detected
its possible ill recalibrate the sensors to scan for low intensity transmissions just to be sure ill sweep your quarters with a resonance scanner
good keep me posted

mister worf i want you to assign a security detail to jason
and what about yourself
i am not the target of boks threats jason is
captain i have compiled all available records pertaining to jason vigos criminal record and
criminal record
yes sir he has been charged three times with petty theft twice for disorderly conduct and several dozen times for trespassing
trespassing
i believe the charges relate to his climbing activities in the caves underneath the planets surface this is the information you requested is it not
thank you mister data


what was your name again
lieutenant rhodes
actually i meant your first name
sandra
well sandra do you think you could give me some room
were supposed to be keeping an eye on you
cant you can keep an eye on me from over there

good morning
i thought you said your ship was the safest place i could be why the guards
because bok appeared in my quarters last night now it might not have been him it may have been an image were investigating
look why dont you just drop me off somewhere i can watch out for myself
that wouldnt be wise
ive been doing it since i was fifteen
im sure you have but bok is a dangerous creature he has a starship he has technology
all right all right ill stay here
you seem to like rock climbing the holodeck can create some very challenging climbs we could go down together and i could show you how to use the programme
thanks but i think i can figure it out myself
perhaps we could climb together im probably not as skilled as you but im not inexperienced
look im sorry i appreciate what youre trying to do but captain captain father jeanluc i dont know what im supposed to call you as soon as this thing with bok is over im leaving so dont you see there really isnt any point in our getting acquainted let me know as soon as you catch him all right
captains log stardate  weve been in the xendi kabu system for over three hours and still no sign of bok

captain i am detecting an object five thousand kilometres off our starboard bow it is another probe
why didnt we detect it before
it must have been cloaked sir it came out of nowhere
on screen is it another holographic device
i do not believe so sir
captain the probes systems are overloading
red alert shields up

damage report
no damage sir
captain i do not believe it was meant as an attack but rather as a message
a message
yes sir in bzal a ferengi code which uses an alternating pattern of light and darkness
can you translate it
i am attempting to do so the message reads my revenge is at hand
hes proved that he can get to us whenever he wants why doesnt he do something


tea earl grey hot

if you want me to stay and talk youd better not call for security this time how do you like your boy captain is he everything youd always hoped for
its a risky game youre playing coming here next time well be ready for you why dont we settle this now
oh and how do you propose to do that picard you murdered my son
it was selfdefence he fired on my ship
you were in ferengi space
i didnt know that if hed told me i would have withdrawn im sorry but theres nothing i can do to bring him back
how touching your apology is worthless to me i demand that you repay me for my loss
you cannot put a price on a life
oh but you can picard you can pay me with your sons life
no
you dont have any choice i insist on being paid


that should do it lets run a level three bioscan just to be sure
rhodes to sickbay medical emergency deck nine section four
lets go



have you had any other seizures like this before
no not really sometimes my hand shakes but never this bad
when did it first start to happen
about few months ago do you have any idea whats wrong with me
you have a condition called the forrester trent syndrome its a degenerative neurological disorder very rare
what do you mean degenerative
if it goes untreated it could result in paralysis even death im going to start you on a neurostabilisation regimen if were lucky it will halt the degeneration and maybe reverse its effects the disease is hereditary i know your father doesnt have it was your mother prone to these seizures
not that i know of
there have been some cases reported where the disease was instigated by a random mutation ill run a microcellular scan and see if thats what happened in the meantime i want you to try to take it easy and get some rest

is he going to be all right
i wish i could say for certain but im not sure how hell respond to treatments
ive been thinking about what you said the other day and you know i think you were right i had convinced myself that jason didnt want me to reach out to him
you know i dont think anyone is born knowing how to be a parent you just sort of figure it out as you go but the one quality that tends to be a requirement for parenthood is patience
well im not sure that that is going to be enough ive found out that jason has a criminal record its nothing very serious its only petty theft and so forth but i cant help feeling that if i had been part of his life then he wouldnt be so troubled now
maybe but why waste time blaming yourself for not having been there just be here for him now
and be patient
and be patient

we think weve found something captain
bok was in direct contact with this chair for an extended period it is showing a distinctive subspace signature as a result
we think hes using some sort of subspace transporter to beam aboard the enterprise
my understanding is that such devices were impractical
the federation abandoned its research in the field because the technology was found to be unreliable as well as energy intensive
in order to transport matter through subspace you have to put it into a state of quantum flux its very unstable
what range would that kind of transporter have
in theory it could operate over several light years
that means that the probe that exploded could have been beamed into position from some point outside sensor range
if bok uses his transporter again we might be able to trace the subspace signature and locate his ship
is there any way we can keep bok from beaming aboard the enterprise again
i dont think there is
if he has the ability to beam aboard he may be able to beam someone away
it is a possibility
im concerned that he may try to take jason is there any way we can protect him
you know we might be able to keep a signal lock on him at all times if bok tries to beam him away we might be able to hold him here
in order to do so we would need to tie the ships subspace field coils into the transporter system
make it so computer where is jason vigo
jason vigo is in holodeck four


 would you wait outside

not bad
i like climbing theres something about actually having your fate in your own hands
yeah i know
it looks as though we may have found out how to locate boks ship this could all soon be over
you came all the way up here just to tell me that
i thought it would make you feel better
thanks that was nice of you
jason when your mother and i parted i lost track of her completely but i would like to know more about what happened to her if you wouldnt mind telling me
like what
well how did you end up on camor its an unlikely place for a woman and child
well you know how she was see a stray cat take it in see somebody cold give them your coat
yes that was miranda all right
she heard about the all children on camor whod been orphaned from the cardassian war
oh i see
i was only ten when we went there i remember her telling me all about the boys and girls who didnt have anybody to take care of them so she got this big house practically falling apart then she started rounding up children eventually there were over forty of us there she called it a school you know she got up before dawn every day and went to bed well after midnight in between she never stopped working she taught us all how to read and she grew vegetables in hardpan to feed us and she made sure we knew how to sing its important in a place like camor and then one day she was attacked by two men in the street in broad daylight for the food she was carrying if shed just given it to them they probably wouldnt have hurt her but she knew how important the food was to us so they killed her
im so sorry
dont be sorry for me my mother made sure that we were all tough enough to make it
jason isnt there some way that i can be a father to you my own father and i were estranged he wanted me to stay home and tend the vineyards and i wanted to join starfleet and he died before we could come to terms with that and ive regretted that all of my life i dont want the same thing to happen to you and me
you dont understand im not anybody youd want for a son trust me if you knew anything about me you wouldnt be trying so hard
youre so wrong
oh really let me spell it out for you ive been in trouble since i was a teenager i lie i steal i use people im a criminal thats what your son is
i know
you do
oh yes i know all about your troubles with the camor authorities
you do
it doesnt make any difference jason youre still my son and like it or not im your father i dont know what that means but it means something theres some connection
yeah
but one thing is clear youll never look at your hairline again in the same way

you wanted to see me
yes its about jason ive finished the microcellular scan i was running theres something you need to know

sir sensors are detecting a subspace carrier wave headed for the ship its signature is consistent with boks transporter
see if you can trace and locate boks ship geordi are you ready down there
ive got a signal lock on jason
riker to picard

picard here
bok is trying to use his transporter

the transporter beam is focusing on deck nine section four
jasons quarters
im on it commander
security to bridge bok is

beaming jason off the ship

initiating transport now im losing his signal

bok is reestablishing his lock on him


have you been able to locate boks ship
no sir the subspace signature left by his transporter is decaying more rapidly than predicted it may not be possible to trace it
captain another probe has materialised five hundred kilometres to starboard it is sending a transmission
put it on screen
this is a very special day picard fifteen years ago you took my son away from me today i will take your son away from you it will be our anniversary i wanted you to see him one last time

i am tracing the transporter beam bok used to send the probe the ship is holding position approximately three hundred billion kilometres from here
plot a course maximum warp
even at warp nine we wouldnt get there for another twenty minutes
the modifications you made to the transporter is there any way we could use a subspace transport from here to get me onto boks ship
it may be possible sir but it would not be advisable
ill take that as a yes youre with me

there ive aligned the field coils
phase dampers are in synch standing by to modulate the transport pattern
captain we might be able to get you over there but i dont see how were going to get you back
 well deal with that when the time comes
transports going to take longer than normal we have to shunt your pattern through the subspace field coils
understood
initiating transport sequence now

maybe we can make a deal
what kind of deal
tell my father you killed me put a phaser burn on my shirt and send it to him hell think im dead thats what this is about isnt it i got friends on camor five that will make it worth your while
i understand your desire to live but i want picard to see your body so there will be no doubt

lower your weapons or bok is dead
lower yours or your son dies
you know as well as i do bok hes not my son i know what youve done miranda vigo is his mother but i am not his father you made it appear so because you resequenced his dna but your technique was flawed he developed a neurological disorder when my ships doctor investigated it she discovered what you had done
now hell never pay the ransom
shut up
there never was a ransom all he was ever interested in was vengeance
daimon is this true
hes not a daimon he was stripped of command
they had no right to do that to me
he lied to you so that you would help him in his plan the enterprise is closing in on your position if you let the two of us go they wont attack you
they wont attack us with you on board
they will cripple your vessel and keep you here until the ferengi authorities arrive youve got a lot deal of explaining to do your only hope is to turn bok over to them and tell them that he deceived you

there is no profit in this for us
captains log stardate  at jasons request the enterprise has returned to camor five

doctor crusher feels im responding well to the treatment she thinks that the damage may be completely reversed
im glad to hear it
yeah
are you sure that you wouldnt like to stay on board the enterprise for a few more days
i cant i have a life back on camor its a mess but id like to go back and straighten things out
i understand

well maybe next time you come back this way you can look me up
i will i put a little something into your bag while you were packing  i know youd probably have preferred a bottle of saurian brandy but thats all i could come up with
i cant accept this
i want you to have it

energise
emergence



graves at my command have wakd their sleepers opd and let em forth by my so potent art but this rough magic i here abjure and when i have required some heavenly music which even now i do to work mine end upon their senses that this airy charm is for ill break my staff bury it certain fathoms in the earth and deeper than did ever plummet sound ill  captain sir your attention is wandering
data i can barely see
but sir i am supposed to be attempting a neoplatonic magical rite the darkness is appropriate for such a ritual
yes but data this is a play the audience has to see you
perhaps i have been too literal with respect to my set design computer modify holodeck programme data seven three
shakespeares the tempest act five scene one
 increase torchlight by twenty percent
there thats much better now do you want to try it again
yes sir captain i am not certain i fully understand this prospero character i would appreciate any insight you might have that would improve my performance
well data shakespeare was witnessing the end of the renaissance and the birth of the modern era and prospero finds himself in a world where his powers are no longer needed so we see him here about to perform one final creative act before giving up his art forever
there is certainly a tragic aspect to the character
yes but theres a certain expectancy too a hopefulness about the future you see shakespeare enjoyed mixing opposites the past and the future hope and despair data what is this is this part of your programme

no sir
what is going on
it appears to be a steam locomotive
a train
if i am not mistaken
computer end programme

computer end programme


captain you are injured

oh yes i know ill get it seen to data

the train we encountered was from one of doctor crushers holodeck programs it was a recreation of the orient express a train which travelled from paris to istanbul from the late nineteenth century until
yes yes data i know about the orient express but what is it doing on prosperos island
there appears to have been a malfunction in the holodecks database retrieval programme the two programs somehow temporarily linked together
is it possible that this malfunction will affect the other holodecks as well
it is a possibility i will need to run a diagnostic to be certain
very good data but shut down the other holodecks until youre finished just to be on the safe side
aye sir

i never realised that you were interested in trains are you aware that at its peak the orient express carried more than ten thousand people a year
it isnt really the train itself that im interested in
what then
its the experience the orient express is romantic mysterious an elegant way to see exotic places and meet fascinating people do you know that one time on one trip both sigmund freud and gertrude stein just happened to be in the same car they ended up having dinner together every night
i wonder what they talked about
why dont you take a trip yourself and find out
riker to picard
picard here
all sections ready to begin the survey sir
very good im on my way thank you
dont forget the trip jeanluc think about it you never know who youll meet on the orient express
captains log stardate  after weathering an unexpected magnascopic storm in the mekorda sector we are continuing our search for new federation colony sites

i dont think theres any possibility of developing sites in this region most of the stars are main sequence binaries there are no mclass planets
well lets move on to another survey region have stellar cartography begin a

mister data report
the ship has moved into warp sir
who gave that command
apparently no one helm and navigation controls are not functioning our speed is now warp seven point three and holding
picard to engineering

mister la forge whats going on weve lost primary helm control on the bridge
i dont understand it the impulse systems suddenly cut out and the warp drive just kicked in
geordi can you take the engines offline
im working on it

mister data whats our heading
bearing one eight seven mark four i am unable to determine our destination however we are heading away from the mekorda sector
captain the computers locked out all the propulsion

controls i cant access any of the overrides

if you want us to stop ill have to do an emergency core shutdown
that would leave us without warp power for more than a week
begin the procedure mister la forge

we are no longer at warp sir impulse power has resumed all systems show normal
where are we
we are approximately thirty billion kilometres from our original position
well done mister la forge

it wasnt me i didnt have time to complete the shutdown procedure
well i want an explanation

mister la forge picard out

have you found anything yet
only that we seem to have more than one mystery here we still dont know why the ship jumped into warp but it looks like were lucky it did there was a theta flux distortion building up around the ship
why didnt our sensors alert us
our sensors were never designed to detect theta flux distortions and yet there is a record of the distortion in the sensor log thats the other mystery
one fact is clear however the distortion was growing in strength if we had remained at our original position one point seven seconds longer the distortion would have ruptured our warp core
if the enterprise hadnt jumped into warp when it did we wouldve been blown to pieces

i just dont get it data what would cause the engines to suddenly jump into warp
perhaps the engines were activated by a random power fluctuation
which occurred just in time to save the ship
it is improbable but it is possible
i dont know i dont think im ready to start believing in luck

there is another possibility
yeah whats that
the sensors apparently detected a dangerous anomaly that threatened the enterprise it is possible that they triggered a safety device which caused the ship to avoid destruction
yeah but theres no direct link between the warp engines and the sensors

whoa what is that its some kind of new circuit node and its connected to at least half a dozen points in the sensor array
it appears to be connected to several other systems as well including the warp control circuits
i guess theres a connection between the warp engines and the sensors after all

a force field where did that come from
i am not certain perhaps it came from the node itself
well wherever it came from it sure doesnt want us messing with this node
it appears to be protecting itself

we found these nodes in several systems around the ship at some level or another theyre all connected
these nodes were linking the sensors to our warp control and defensive systems we believe this is why the ship jumped to warp
when the sensors detected danger the defensive systems reacted to the threat and activated the warp engines to protect us
where did these nodes come from
it is possible that the magnascopic storm we recently experienced had an unexpected effect on the ships systems
wherever they come from they seem to be multiplying
as they increase it will become progressively more difficult to control the ship
what do you propose we do
well getting rid of them isnt going to be so easy when we attempted to examine the circuitry of one of the nodes it generated a force field to keep us out
whatevers going on our first priority is getting back control of the ship
agreed all of the nodal connections intersect in holodeck three it appears to be a focal point of some kind
we might be able to find a way to use the holodeck circuitry to disable the nodes permanently
all right lets do it

commander the holodeck appears to be in operation
i thought you shut down the entire system
i did but it has reactivated itself and it will not disengage
which programme is running
several different programs are running simultaneously
this should be interesting


you werent kidding mister data
no sir i estimate that this scene consists of portions of seven distinct holodeck programs
see if you can access the circuits that have been affected by the nodes

tickets tickets please please have your tickets ready thank you sir thank you madam thank you thank you sir tickets please
you know ive never even been away from home now im going all the way to vertiform city
very nice sir enjoy your trip tickets please tickets thank you sir

tickets please tickets please
commander i have located a large concentration of nodes behind this wall they appear to be connected directly to the holodecks main power coupling
all right go ahead and depolarise the entire power grid
the power grid is located beneath this deck sir
get away from there would you gentlemen care to show me your tickets
i believe we left our tickets in our compartments mister worf i told you to bring the tickets
i forgot
i dont think you folks belong on this train
hold it you leave these people alone theyre only trying to help
you go back to the engine this doesnt concern you
theyre all trying to hijack the train
hey if youre the engineer whos doing the drivin

i am


easy sir easy ive got you
im all right thanks it looks like the navigational relays overloaded



geordi whats going on we just went into warp
weve lost engine and helm control again captain but this time theyre completely burned out i dont know if we can stop the ship

i believe we have changed direction
now were on the right track ladies and gentlemen we are on our way

i was right he was trying to make off with my brick
you take good care of that we cant afford to lose it now are you people going to leave or are we going to have to throw you off the train
commander according to my tricorder the holodeck safeties have been disengaged his weapon could be lethal
all right lets get out of here

the number of systems now being affected by the nodes has increased considerably sensors engines replicators propulsion they are all working together now almost independently of the main computer and the nodes link them all through the holodeck
but why the holodeck it doesnt make any sense
commander i believe what happens on the holodeck has a direct effect on the ship when we attempted to destroy the nodes the characters on the train responded almost immediately to stop us
and when the engineer tried to protect us one of the characters shot him
then the conductor then signalled for the train to change directions and at approximately the same time
the enterprise also took off in a new direction
are you saying the ship is under the control of the holodeck
not precisely geordi does the configuration of connection nodes look familiar to you
yeah yeah it looks a little like the structure of your positronic brain
that is correct it would appear that the nodes are in the process of creating a rudimentary neural net
data what are you suggesting
unlikely as it may sound i believe that the enterprise may be forming an intelligence

this is a synaptic map of the human neocortex this is a cross section of my positronic net and this is a schematic of the connection nodes linking the ships systems i believe some sort of neural matrix is forming on the ship it is still relatively primitive but it is an intelligence nonetheless
how could that happen
i believe it is an emergent property
explain
complex systems can sometimes behave in ways that are entirely unpredictable the human brain for example might be described in terms of cellular functions and neurochemical interactions but that description does not explain human consciousness a capacity that far exceeds simple neural functions consciousness is an emergent property
in other words something thats more than just the sum of its parts
exactly
how does that explain whats happening to the enterprise
the enterprise contains a vast database of information which is managed by a sophisticated computer this complex system gives the ship many of the characteristics of a biological organism
thats true it sees with its sensors it talks with its communications systems
in a sense it almost reproduces with the replicators
and you think that the ship has somehow gone beyond those functions and is developing a new capacity
yes sir i believe a selfdetermining intelligence is emerging
if that is so what does the ship want where is it taking us
i believe the key to understanding the ships behaviour lies in the holodeck all of the connection nodes intersect at that location it is clearly some kind of processing centre
processing centre
yes sir a focal point where all the ideas and instincts of this emerging intelligence are first expressed in some form
almost like an imagination captain id like to go to the holodeck i could interact with the characters and maybe find some clues to help us understand whats happening
very well mister data mister worf i want you to go along see if you can to reestablish control of the ship without damaging the nodes if the ship is truly an emerging intelligence then we have a responsibility to treat it with the same respect as any other being

welcome aboard counsellor
if you will distract these people i will attempt to depolarise the power grid

excuse me have you finished the puzzle yet
not yet but were gettin close
do you recognise it
no
i would like to help tell me what exactly are you making
what do you think were making a puzzle
no i meant the picture what is it
well i dont know

can you deal me in
sorry its a two man game

hey get your hand off of that
is that why you killed the engineer to get this brick
i had to get it back you know how much its worth lady plenty and i got to get it to keystone city
why whats at keystone city
thats where everything begins gin

are you succeeding commander
i am ready to access the main power grid
keystone city next stop keystone city well look whos back
we do not want any trouble we are simply passengers
well then im sure you wouldnt mind showing me your tickets right sorry boys youre getting off right here
this is my stop
wait what happens at keystone city why are you taking the brick there
excuse me
i think we should follow that man that brick may be an important clue


where did he go

i can access the power grid here i will attempt to depolarise the grid by using a low frequency inversion field it may disengage the nodes without destroying them
there he is im going after him



what are you doing here
laying the foundation

now if youll excuse me ive got a train to catch

i dont understand it captain all of a sudden cargo bay five started to depressurise
did everyone get out in time
yes sir and ive reestablished the containment field but im reading massive power surges in the cargo bay and all sorts of transporter activity something weird is happening there captain
i want you to send a team down there immediately find out whats going on
aye sir


la forge to bridge
picard here whats going on
i wish i could tell you

that man said he was laying a foundation
foundation for what
troi to data
data here
how are you doing

i encountered a minor difficulty counsellor but it has been dealt with

i am ready to depolarise the power grid

it looks like the ships replicator and transporter systems have been merged somehow to create this the question is what is it ensign i want to run a full spectral analysis on this

im picking up a massive power fluctuations the ship is losing its structural integrity

whats happening
its an earthquake


la forge to data

stop what youre doing
acknowledged


are you all right
im fine

data i think we ought to get together and compare notes
agreed


the ship was protecting itself again stopping us from interfering whatever its doing it intends to continue
im betting it all has something to do with that object thats forming in the cargo bay
i think hes right captain look at the common themes playing out on the holodeck a puzzle being put together a foundation being laid a paper doll being fashioned theyre all images of something being constructed
and some kind of object in the cargo bay thats being constructed atom by atom
what is that object
i have no idea its composed of silica polymers duranium and a couple of other compounds we havent been able to identify yet but creating it has had quite an effect on our systems warp power has dropped forty seven percent
counsellor did you draw any other conclusions from your experiences on the holodeck anything that would help us to understand this situation
the holodeck was full of metaphoric imagery like it was having some kind of daydream it may not make literal sense but symbolically it probably does have some kind of logic to it
the characters you spoke to do they have any significance
i think they represent different aspects of the ship the engineer for instance may represent the navigational system the gunslinger could be the weapon system
is there any way that we can persuade them to give back control of the ship
i dont think its possible to reason with them many of them are genuinely unaware of whats going on its as though this emergent intelligence is like an infant acting on impulse trying to figure itself out as it goes the only source of experience it can draw on is ours through our holodeck programs
is there a way that we can relate to them on their own level find some way to influence their behaviour
maybe there is id like to go back and try
counsellor we havent been able to reestablish the safeties
the injuries you suffered on the holodeck werent severe but next time they might kill you
im aware of that
very well counsellor go ahead but bear in mind that whenever we have tried to hinder their efforts weve failed perhaps its time to cooperate with them

you dont belong on this train
three tickets for vertiform city
guess i was wrong about you folks welcome aboard

what was that
weve been having some problems the engine is running out of steam i hope we make it to vertiform city on time
is there anything we can do to help
well i could use a pair of strong arms in the engine room might help us get back on schedule
why dont you go with him worf well see what we can do here

excuse me are we going to get there okay
of course you neednt worry about a thing so tell me everything you know about vertiform city
well they got this restaurant there where you can eat all you want any time its the best food around


theres the coal and theres the boiler im much obliged for your help

well done sir i think thisll make a difference all right

i dont know how or why sir but warp power appears to be back to normal levels
whats our heading
we appear to be on a course for tambor beta six its a white dwarf star

keep it steady put your back into it thats the ticket

the ship is using a modified tractor beam to collect vertion particles from the star
vertion particles vertiform city thats what the ship was looking for

the particles are being routed through the transporter system into cargo bay five
geordi whats going on
the object is absorbing

vertion particles its growing even faster than before commander im picking up internal energy this thing

what do you mean
i mean its generating its own energy im picking up coherent emissions

matter conversion its incredible wait a minute wait a minute somethings wrong weve got power fluctuations vertion absorption rate is dropping whats happening to the particle beam

the beams exhausted the supply of particles in the star theres nothing left to take out
captain

the energy output of the object is decreasing

somethings wrong
what is it
this was supposed to be vertiform city 
weve been on the wrong track all along


are you all right
yes what happened
the conductor accidently derailed the train
data to captain picard

picard here
there has been an accident on the holodeck sir has anything happened to the enterprise
yes weve had a shipwide shutdown weve lost attitude control and most systems are offline
captain youd better take a look at this when the particle beam cut off the object was beginning to form a coherent energy matrix now if these readings are accurate id say that the emission patterns were almost organic
are you suggesting that the enterprise is trying to create a lifeform
i think so
will it survive
well its energy levels are dropping rapidly unless it gets an infusion of vertion particles and i mean soon i dont think so

captain all of our systems are back online and were moving again at warp nine
lets get back to the bridge


whoo wee that was a close one wasnt it
where are we going now
well new vertiform city of course
data to captain
picard here
the train has returned to normal sir our destination is new vertiform city

whats our course
were heading for the cordannas system
another white dwarf star
its the nearest one to our last position
captain we have a problem even at warp nine the cordannas system is over twelve hours from here
will the object in the cargo bay survive that long
yes sir but thats not the problem the ship has diverted all of our systems to maximum propulsion including life support we have less than two hours of reserve oxygen
mister data we have to stop the enterprise that means you have to get control of the train
understood sir
the ship is looking for vertion particles and it believes that the cordannas system is the closest source is there any possibility of anything closer
white dwarf stars are the only natural sources of vertions sir
then what about artificial ones can you create the particles

how did the conductor stop the train
there is a braking lever in the engine room
lets go
sorry folks but you aint going nowhere

ive narrowed the search to the macpherson nebula which is a supernova remnant and dikon alpha which is a class nine pulsar theyre both fairly close to our current flight path and either one could produce vertion particles if we detonated a modified photon torpedo inside it
vertions usually occur in miniscule amounts do you think either of these phenomena could produce enough of them
its really hard to say i cant even guarantee that we can create them at all
well weve got to give it a try the nebula or the pulsar its your choice mister la forge
i say go with the nebula
very well begin the torpedo modifications
now lets see if we can get this ship to go where we want

please listen to me we understand whats happening we know you have get to new vertiform city and we want to help you get there
well i dont know
please were your friends
youre really going to help get us to new vertiform city
i promise
okay but just one of you the rest stay here

thats far enough
sorry to spoil your party pal its nothing personal
i can get us there more quickly i know a shorter route
dont listen to him hes up to somethin
a shorter route
yes if you will let me handle the controls
dont do it
well were already behind schedule if you can get us there on time all right go on but no funny stuff
data to captain picard i have taken control of the engine room

stand by are we within sensor range of the nebula
yes captain we are
mister data i need you to slow us to impulse speed

i will attempt to do so
i hope you know what youre doing


are the modifications to the torpedoes complete
aye sir
launch torpedo

its working captain the reaction is producing vertion particles

well what do you know were here
new vertiform city

the nodes are deactivating all over the ship our systems are beginning to function normally again
then the purpose of the ships intelligence was simply to bring this life form into being
there are some species whose sole purpose is to reproduce once they finally procreate they die
captain



captains log supplemental the enterprise is back under our control all traces of the emergent intelligence are gone and the object it created has disappeared into space

come

captain i am staging a scene from the tempest this evening for a small audience i would like for you to attend
i would be honoured what scene
mirandas first encounter with other human beings
o brave new world that has such people in it
it seemed appropriate captain you took a substantial risk in allowing the enterprise to complete its task
why do you say that
because the end result was unknown the object could have been dangerous it may in fact be dangerous
and i have allowed it to go off on its merry way
yes sir
the intelligence that was formed on the enterprise didnt just come out of the ships systems it came from us from our mission records personal logs holodeck programs our fantasies now if our experiences with the enterprise have been honourable cant we trust that the sum of those experiences will be the same
preemptive strike

captains log stardate  the enterprise is en route to a briefing on the situation in the demilitarised zone along the cardassian border meanwhile were celebrating the return of an old friend

ro
welcome home
thanks its good to be back
congratulations on your promotion lieutenant
same to you commander
thank you
say i understand that advanced tactical training is a real picnic
right
did you see the buffet
this is real bajoran foraiga
it wasnt easy to find
you shouldnt have gone to all this trouble really
we wanted you to know how glad we are to have you back

so where are your new quarters
deck four section eight
what are do you planning to do
lieutenant ro
go ahead sir
please report to the bridge
yes sir excuse me

captain
you seemed a bit overwhelmed by all the attention
well to tell you the truth i really want to see everyone id just rather do it one at a time
you look very fit lieutenant tactical training seems to agree with you
you know me i enjoy a challenge
that school is more than a challenge half the class washes out every year but somehow i didnt think youd be one of those
captain i want you to know that i really appreciate your recommending me if it werent for you my life would be a very different one right now
bridge to picard
go ahead

were receiving a distress signal from a cardassian ship near the demilitarised zone

change course to intercept im on my way id like you at the conn lieutenant

ensign gates

report
the cardassian ship relayed a distress signal but it was cut off before we could find out what was wrong
i have the ship on long range sensors it appears to be under attack by several small ships
can you identify them
no sir theyre not transmitting identification codes
i will scan their warp signatures sir sensors indicate the attacking vessels are federation ships

were coming into visual range
on screen
those are federation ships
isolate one and magnify the maquis open a channel
open
to all maquis ships call off your attack or we will be forced to engage you
no response
you are federation citizens your actions are in violation of our treaty with the cardassians call off your attack
they are not responding sir
mister worf are we in firing range
not yet sir
arm phasers and photon torpedoes and stand by
i never thought wed be firing on our own people to protect a cardassian ship
the maquis ships are regrouping sir they are closing in on the cardassian vessel
the cardassians shields are down to thirty percent
they may not be able to withstand another hit
sir we are within weapons range
mister worf can you detonate a torpedo spread between the maquis ships and the cardassians
yes sir
do it

the maquis are breaking formation they are withdrawing
signal the cardassians that were standing by to assist them if they have any wounded
aye sir

do you people have experience treating cardassians
yes do you mind
gul evek im sorry that we could not come to your aid sooner
i suppose were lucky you came at all lately starfleet seems to look the other way when the maquis attack
i can assure you that is not the case were doing everything in our power to control them
the fact that my ship was attacked suggests that your efforts have met with limited success they came at us with photon torpedoes and type eight phasers tell me captain how do you suppose that a group of civilians acquired such weaponry
i can assure you it was not through official channels
so you dont think the fact that some of the maquis are former starfleet officers has anything to do with it
starfleet does not condone the maquis actions in the demilitarised zone any more than your government would condone the paramilitary actions of cardassian civilians
we have taken measures to deal with our colonists who have armed themselves
considering that they destroyed a juhryan freighter less than a week ago i would say that your efforts are meeting with limited success
captain if the maquis are not stopped this situation will continue to escalate to the point where the cardassian military will have no choice but to take matters into their own hands
captains log supplemental gul evek and his crew have left the enterprise and we have proceeded to our rendezvous with admiral nechayev

no bularian canaps this time captain
i thought twice was pushing it a little
its just as well theyre extremely fattening
you missed gul evek by a matter of hours i asked him to stay i thought that an admirals assurances might convince him that we are trying to deal with this maquis situation
evek manages to make the cardassians sound like helpless sheep being preyed on by federation wolves the truth is we caught the cardassian government supplying its colonies in the demilitarised zone with weapons
gul evek assured me that they had stopped that practice
ha how comforting
admiral this maquis situation has you worried
believe me captain if i were living that close to the cardassians id keep a phaser under my pillow too but in the last weeks weve seen signs that the maquis are moving beyond selfdefence their ranks are growing theyre acquiring ships weapons they seem to be preparing for a more aggressive military posture weve got to put a stop to them before the entire demilitarised zone ignites but before we stop them we have to find them they seem to be scattered in small cells around the zone and we dont have reliable intelligence about any of them
perhaps you need an undercover operative
our thinking exactly we intend to infiltrate their organisation and the person we want to do it is aboard your ship right now

starfleet wants me to infiltrate the maquis
because of your recent training because youre bajoran and because of your past troubles with starfleet gives you a certain credibility
well thats certainly true and just how soon would this mission begin
immediately
i see ive spent the better part of my life fighting the cardassians i never thought id be helping them out
this is a rare case when our interests and theirs coincide we both want peace in the demilitarised zone
ive heard a lot about the maquis one of my instructors at tactical training a lieutenant commander in starfleet a man i admired and respected he was sympathetic to them he resigned and left to join them
were all sympathetic lieutenant our civilian population in the demilitarised zone is in a very difficult situation but even sympathy has to end at some point the peace treaty isnt just a piece of paper if the maquis force us into a war with cardassia it could mean hundreds of thousands of lives two years ago starfleet would never have tapped you for this mission they must have a lot of confidence in you now
the way i see it theres one good reason to take this mission and thats to validate your faith in me


we are looking for a bajoran woman dark hair
she is responsible for the death of a cardassian soldier
if we learn that she has been here this establishment will be closed down
you say she had dark hair
yes
she was here you just missed her
do you know where she went
no

it was really nice meeting you

thanks
so did you kill that cardassian
starfleet thinks i did thats reason enough to hide why did you tell them that id left
there are worse things a person can do than kill a cardassian soldier
you dont often meet someone willing to say that out loud
in the zone there are a lot of us who feel that way
id like to meet people like that


 dont be afraid youre not in danger here
what is your name
did you kill that cardassian soldier
who are you
were the people who saved you from starfleet
thanks but ill be going now

did you kill that cardassian
yes
thats a risky thing to do in the demilitarised zone you can end up being hunted by starfleet and the cardassians
then why did he risk bringing me here
were asking the questions who are you
my name is ro laren i grew up in the bajoran camps
that would explain why you have no love for cardassians
i know what theyre capable of they tortured my father to death and i was forced to watch
where are you living now
nowhere i was a starfleet officer but i was courtmartialled and sent to the stockade on jaros two im not exactly what youd call starfleet material
when were you on jaros
what difference does it make
we want to check your story when were you there
starfleet let me out about three years ago because i agreed to do some work for them mostly having to do with bajor but i got tired of watching them placate the cardassians and so i left
you resigned
not officially thats part of the reason why theyre looking for me
what were you doing on omara
look i think ive answered enough of your questions i would like to know who you people are
lets say that we sympathise with those who oppose cardassia
are you maquis
what if we were
if you were i would ask if i could join you and help you fight
well check your story go ahead ill keep an eye on her

come lets stretch our legs


arent you taking a chance by letting me see all of this what if my story doesnt check out what if im not who i say i am
well then well have a problem wont we
you are maquis arent you
many of the people here are
starfleet considers you outlaws theyre afraid youll destroy the peace treaty
they dont understand the situation here in the zone i lived on juhraya when the treaty was signed the colony suddenly found itself in cardassian territory some of us chose to stay take our chances then one night i was dragged from my bed and beaten the authorities clucked their tongues and agreed it was an unfortunate incident and did nothing
im not surprised the cardassians intend to make life so unpleasant for federation citizens that theyll leave
exactly and no one seems to see that except the maquis how old were you when your father was killed
id rather not talk about it
hungry would you like something
no thank you
 hasperat
you like hasperat
an old bajoran friend of mine used to make it his was stronger he was killed many years ago fighting the cardassian occupation of bajor i miss his company and his hasperat
my father used to make the strongest hasperat youve ever tasted everything else seems mild by comparison
did he teach you how to make it
yes but i havent tried it in years
if you would make the brine for a really strong hasperat i mean eye watering tongue searing strong youd make an old man very happy
i would enjoy making it again
macias ive checked with my sources at starfleet her storys true
i was sure it was kalita shell stay with you until we can find her a room

ah there you are
weve just heard a disturbing rumour
another rumour
one that i think we should take seriously a trader coming from pendi two said he could verify that the cardassians are going to start supplying their colonists with biogenic weapons
i thought every shipment coming into the zone was searched
the cardassians always seem to find a way around problems like that
then we have to make a preemptive strike send a message to the cardassians that we wont sit still while they kill us with toxins
agreed but we cant mount a strike without medical supplies and our stockpile is dangerously low
if we put in a request for more itll draw suspicion
i can get medical supplies i served on the enterprise they always have extra medkits on hand for relief missions
youre wanted by starfleet theyre not going to give you medkits just because you ask for them
i have no intention of asking for them i intend to take them
how the enterprise is a fortress
i know its security systems work give me a ship i can do it
its madness
we cant let her do something like this we dont know anything about her
i know that she can make very strong hasperat
what
we need medical supplies i think we should let her try
all right but im going with her
i could use an extra hand at the controls and a witness

i set the transporter confinement parameters to maximum we should be able to fill our hold with medical supplies with just one single beam out
i had no idea it was going to be so easy
were approaching the federation border
how do you plan to get out of the demilitarised zone without being searched at one of the checkpoints
were going to cross the border here
there are sensor buoys all along the border if we cross anywhere other than a checkpoint starfleet will send a ship to investigate
with the right security codes we can disable the proximity detectors on the buoys
starfleet changes those codes all the time
i know the encryption algorithms if i can access the buoys protocol subsystem i should be able to figure out the codes
should be able to
do you want this mission to succeed
of course i do we need those medical supplies
in that case let me do my job im in
whats wrong
if i dont input the right code in the next twenty seconds well trigger the proximity alarm
im getting us out of sensor range
dont if we break the comm link we wont be able to try again
it worked until they change the access codes again we can cross the border here
captains log stardate  it has been over a week since lieutenant ro left the enterprise we have yet to receive any communication from her

we picked up a request for emergency assistance from a federation science ship in the topin system
are there any other ships in the vicinity
were the closest
helm set course for the topin system mister data will you signal the science ship that were on our way
it is unlikely that they would receive our communication sir the topin system contains an unstable protostar it generates significant magnetoscopic interference
can we use our sensors to find them
most of our sensors would be ineffective although our directional array should cut through the interference
that array has such a narrow scan field we might as well break out the palm beacons and try to find them that way

this is insane were sitting here no sensors blind to the outside waiting for a galaxy class starship to come swooping down on us
dont worry itll be hard for them to locate us with just the directional sensors besides theyre looking for a damaged science ship that wants to be found theyre here standby to engage thrusters

anything
no sir it will take approximately six hours to scan this system
captain the distress call is being repeated
data can you locate the signal
i am attempting to do so

theyre scanning our last position
all right ive locked onto their sensor beam im going to use it to manoeuvre into transporter range
how are we going to beam through their shields
we cant if were going to get those medical supplies were going to have to take this ship through their shields

sir i am scanning the area from which the distress signal was sent but i am unable to detect a vessel
captain the computer has detected a piggyback communication on the last distress signal
can you decode it
it will take a few moments
do it

the enterprise shields have a weak point when the ship is at impulse the thrust destabilises the shield configuration right at this point  im going to try to punch through there
wont they detect us
theyll know somethings penetrated the shields with all the interference itll take them a few seconds to find us well have to beam the medical supplies aboard and get out fast

the message is difficult to decode interference has garbled much of the transmission but it seems to be from lieutenant ro
ro is on that ship
sir a vessel of some kind is attempting to penetrate our aft shields
let it through

were going to make it all right were in
energising

lets get out of here

captain a quantity of medical supplies was beamed from cargo bay seven
the vessel that penetrated our shields is of the same design as the ships used by the maquis it is moving off
let it go there must be someone with her we should make it look as though were trying to stop them mister worf lock phasers on their previous position and fire
aye sir
now we know what they mean by advanced tactical training

you took your ship through their shields
ro parked us between their warp nacelles i thought she was crazy but it worked she knew exactly what she was doing
well done
i have to inventory supplies and find out what we have
see you later

well it seems that kalita has decided youre not a federation spy after all shes suspicious of everyone at first and rightly so weve learned to be cautious with strangers
i understand
but ive known since i first met you that in your heart youre one of us
captains log supplemental having earned the maquis trust with her raid on the enterprise lieutenant ro has been given access to a ship and allowed to leave the settlement by herself

there are rumours that the cardassians are supplying their colonists with biogenic weapons
frankly i find it hard to believe every ship that enters the demilitarised zone is being searched
the maquis are convinced that the cardassians are finding a way around these searches
you know we could make use of that
sir
we have come up with a plan that has the potential to seriously curtail the maquis we want to give them a target so threatening to them that theyll be willing to commit as many ships and people as possible in order to destroy it
what do you mean give them a target
biogenic weapons for example you could provide them with intelligence that would show that the cardassians are in fact supplying their colonists with them
that would get their attention all right
you could tell them that in order to get past the check points theyre shipping the components for these weapons through third parties and then we could put together a convoy and send it toward the demilitarised zone
and when the maquis attack it starfleet will be waiting for them
we could station our ships in the hugora nebula to avoid detection
basically i would be leading them into a trap
thats right if you have a problem with any of this i need to know it now
well if i do sir it will not stop me from carrying out my duty
i knew that i could count on you

it took me a while but i managed to patch through into starfleets comm system i intercepted a communication from one of the checkpoints on the border theyre concerned because a pakled transport came through carrying retroviral vaccines
why is that a concern
well last week a ferengi transport came through carrying biomimetic gels by themselves neither of these is dangerous but starfleet is concerned because with along with other components the cardassians could put together a biogenic device
what is starfleet going to do about it
they cant do anything about it these items are all perfectly legal
how close are the cardassians to having the components they need
very close two days ago a yridian convoy left deep space nine for the demilitarised zone its carrying isomiotic hypos plasma flares and quarantine pods
we cant let that convoy reach its destination
but its too big for us to go after alone
ill discuss the situation with the other cell leaders considering whats at stake theyll want to help

ive sent a communication to the others when this is over well celebrate
when its over
when cardassia realises they cant intimidate us into leaving our colonies
something tells me itll be a long time before well be celebrating
dont be discouraged ro itll take time but the important thing is that we not give up
i spent ten years in the camps i dont give up
ive been thinking a long time about what our celebration will be like well have a huge dinner youll make hasperat and ill make blueberry pie well drink wine and well dance ill even play the belaklavion thatll give everyone a laugh
you play the klavion
yes badly its a difficult instrument but i enjoy the challenge
my father played the klavion when i was very young and afraid of monsters under my bed hed play for me he said that the klavion had special powers monsters were afraid of it and when they heard it they would disappear when i listened to that music he played for me i was never afraid to go to sleep when he died i realised even he couldnt make all the monsters go away
why wait lets go to the market lets get food for a feast for a celebration
a celebration of what
of absolutely nothing just to celebrate
id like that

come lets go to the market if im going to make a pie well have to find a substitute for blueberries havent seen real ones in years
on bajor theres a berry
yes i know it very sweet

ro

macias
they must have found out that there was a maquis cell here
kalita get one of the medkits hurry you have to hang on
when an old fighter like me dies someone always steps forward to take his place



not tonight  hello are you alone
i hope not
why dont we get acquainted theres a table in the back thats more private
id like that

we have to cancel the mission
why
the maquis didnt go for the bait they think the convoy is too big a target
but there are only six ships we could even cut back that number
its the commitment of resources of grouping so many of the maquis together at once they feel that it makes them too vulnerable
every intelligence report that i get from starfleet suggests that the maquis are eager to expand their strikes they want to escalate their activities now youre telling me this isnt true
its probably different in every cell the people ive met tend to be more conservative im sure others have a more militant attitude
laren whats going on
do you have the money i asked you to bring
yes
put some on the table
what
by this time you should be negotiating my price when you sent me on this mission i thought that i could do it even though it meant helping cardassians even though it meant betraying people who are fighting against them now im not sure where i stand
are you saying you want to back out of this mission
sir i dont want to let you down i swear that i dont
this has nothing to do with me this is about you if you back out now youll throw away everything youve worked for were committed to this mission my only question for you is can you carry out your orders i could put you before a board of inquiry for having lied to me about this operation i would certainly have you courtmartialled if you sabotage it now its your decision
ill carry out my orders sir
i feel it necessary to have commander riker go back with you he can pose as a relative i just want to make sure that nothing happens to obstruct this mission

im sorry i dont have that kind of money
captains log supplemental we have received word from commander riker and lieutenant ro that the maquis will be attacking the convoy as planned our ships have taken up position in the hugora nebula to wait for them


i have established a relay link with the sensor probe we left on the perimeter of the nebula this is the convoy we are expecting the maquis attack force to cross the border from the demilitarised zone
as soon as they cross the border well intercept them
captain in order to ensure that the ship commander riker and lieutenant ro are piloting does not come under fire i have relayed their warp signature to the rest of the attack force
sir the maquis squadron is coming into sensor range
go to red alert
aye sir

squad leader to all ships
go ahead squad leader

well be crossing the border in less than one minute arm your weapons
acknowledged

starfleet cant make its move until were out of the demilitarised zone were to break formation and take cover in the nebula as soon as they appear
the ships in the convoy are raising their shields theyve spotted us
we cross the border in thirty seconds

what the

im sorry i cant let this happen

sir the vessel being piloted by lieutenant ro is firing a low intensity particle beam into the nebula
what the hell is she doing
the polarising effect being created by the beam may make it possible for us to be detected
can you counter the effect
i will attempt to do so

ro why are you firing
scan the nebula

theres a starfleet attack force hiding inside it

i see it squad leader to all ships abort the mission repeat abort the mission

sir the maquis ships are breaking formation
have they crossed the border
no sir they are withdrawing
captain lieutenant ros ship is not retreating with the others it is heading toward us
when she comes aboard take her into custody

alpha seven to alpha nine
go ahead
stand by to beam me aboard
standing by
you can take this ship back to the enterprise
youre going with them
its been a long time since i really felt like i really belonged somewhere could you tell captain picard something for me
of course what is it
tell him im sorry
so long ro take care of yourself
goodbye will energise

she seemed very sure that she was making the right choice i think her only real regret was that she let you down heres my report

all good things


that was an incredible programme
i am glad you approve i have always found the black sea at night to be a most stimulating experience
worf we were walking barefoot on the beach with balalaika music in the air ocean breeze washing over us stars in the sky a full moon rising and the most you can say is stimulating
it was very stimulating

what

you know i dont spend nearly enough time on the holodeck i should take my own advice and go there to relax next time ill choose the programme if you like the black sea youre going to love lake cataria on betazed
deanna perhaps before there is a next time we should discuss commander riker
why is he coming along
no but i do not wish i mean it would be unfortunate if he if you and i are going to continue i do not wish to hurt his feelings
worf i think its all right to concentrate on our feelings yours and mine

 counsellor whats todays date the date
stardate 

captain whats wrong
 im not sure i dont know how or why but im moving back and forth through time

i had this feeling i had physically left the enterprise i was in another time another place i was somewhere in the past
can you describe where you were what it looked like
you see its all slipping away so fast its like waking up from a nightmare it was years ago it was before i took command of the enterprise i was talking to someone i cant remember who and then it all changed i was no longer in the past i was now an old man in the future and i was outside and i was doing something i cant remember what it was im sorry its all gone i just cant remember
its all right have you considered the possibility that this was just a dream
no no it was much more than a dream the smells the sounds the very touch of things much more real than a dream
how long did you spend in each time period did it seem like minutes hours
you see i cant say at first i had a sense of confusion disorientation i wasnt sure where i was and then all that passed and it all seemed perfectly natural as though i belonged in that time but i cant


captain picard to the bridge captain weve got a problem with the warp core or the phase inducers or some other damn thing
geordi

hello captain or should i call you ambassador
oh i havent been called that for some time either
how about mister picard
how about jeanluc
i dont think i could get used to that
good lord geordi well how long has it been
nine years
no no no since you last called me captain since we were all together on the enterprise
close to twenty five years
twenty five years well time has been good to you
ia little too good to me in some places can i give you a hand here
oh well im just tying up some vines
youve got leaf miners you might want to use a bacillus spray my wife is quite a gardener ive picked up a little bit of it
how is leah
just wonderful busy as ever shes just been made director of the daystrom institute
what about the little ones brett alandra and er
sidney
sidney
well theyre not so little any more brett is applying to starfleet academy next year
so what brings you here
oh i just thought id stop by been thinking about the old days on the enterprise i was in the neighbourhood
geordi you dont make the trip from rigel three to earth just to drop by
no
so youve heard
leahs got a few friends at starfleet medical word gets around
im not an invalid irumodic syndrome can take years to run its course
i know once i heard well i just wanted to stop by just the same
well now that youre here you can help me carry those tools well my cooking may not be up to leahs standards but i can still make a decent cup of tea oh i read your last novel i thought that the protagonist a little too flamboyant but for the rest i

captain are you all right captain
captain


will this be your first time on a galaxy class starship are you all right sir sir
im sorry lieutenant my mind must have wandered what were you saying
i was asking if youd ever been aboard a galaxy class starship before
no of course im familiar with the blueprints and specifications but this will be my first time aboard
well then if i may be so bold sir youre in for a treat the enterprise is quite a ship
im sure she is
have i done something wrong sir
no its just that you look very familiar
enterprise to shuttlecraft galileo you are cleared for arrival in shuttlebay two
acknowledged enterprise and there she is


captain captain
tasha i was just with tasha in the shuttle

ive finished the neurographic scan i dont see anything that might cause hallucinations or a psychogenic reaction
is there any indication of temporal displacement
no usually a temporal shift would leave some kind of triptamine residue in the cerebral cortex but the scan didnt show any personally i think you just enjoy waking everybody up in the middle of the night
actually i really like running around the ship in my bare feet
 the biospectral test results doctor
your blood gas analysis is consistent with someone whos been breathing the ships air for weeks if youd been somewhere else there would be an indication of change in the oxygen isotope ratios thanks deanna would you excuse us please
of course

jeanluc i scanned for evidence of irumodic syndrome as you suggested there wasnt any but i did find a small structural defect in the parietal lobe
a defect that you hadnt noticed before
its the kind of defect that would only show up on a level four neurographic scan it could cause you to be susceptible to several kinds of neurological disorders including irumodic syndrome now its possible for you to live with this defect for the rest of your life without developing a problem or even if you do many people continue to live normal lives for a long time after the onset of irumodic syndrome
if thats so why do you look like youve just signed my death sentence
im sorry i guess it caught me off guard
i wouldnt worry about it something tells me that youre going to have to put up with me for a long time to come
well it wont be easy but ill manage

captain
has worf found anything
no sir his security scans came up negative theyre still checking the sensor logs but there is no indication that you ever left the ship
i wasnt dreaming something happened
worf to captain
go ahead mister worf
sir there is an incoming transmission from admiral nakamura it is a priority one message
beverly mister worf will you route the call through to doctor crushers office
aye sir

captain
admiral
i am initiating a fleetwide yellow alert starfleet intelligence has picked up some alarming reports from the romulan empire it appears that at least thirty warbirds have been pulled from other assignments and are headed for the neutral zone
is there any explanation why they would make such a blatantly aggressive move
our operatives on romulus have indicated that there appears to be something happening in the neutral zone specifically in the devron system our own long range scans have picked up some kind of spatial anomaly in the area we cant tell what it is
what are our orders
this is a very delicate situation i am deploying fifteen starships along our side of the neutral zone i want you to go there as well see if you can find out what is going on in the devron system
am i authorised to enter the neutral zone
not yet wait and see what the romulans do you can conduct long range scans send probes if necessary but do not cross the border unless they do
understood
starfleet out

captain whats wrong
this is not my time i dont belong here
what
i was somewhere else a few moments ago
what do you mean youve been right here with me
no no no i was somewhere else i was it was a long time ago there was someone talking i was talking to someone beverly i was talking to beverly
its okay captain everythings going to be all right
im not senile you know this did happen i was here i was talking to you and then i was somewhere else i was on the enterprise i was back on the enterprise at least i think thats where it was i was in sickbay well it might have been a hospital
captain i think we should go back to the house and call your doctor
yes yes i know what youre thinking its the irumodic syndrome hes beginning to lose his mind the old man well its not that and im not daydreaming either
well all right all right so what do you want do about it
data i want to see data
data why
because i think he can help
help how
i dont know i dont know i want to see data
okay then all right lets go see data hes still at cambridge isnt he
yes i think he is

you see them dont you
see who
theyre everywhere theyre laughing at me why are they laughing
come on captain lets go see data
yes data well go see data


i know how it sounds but it happened it was real i was there back on board the enterprise
 how do you like your tea
tea earl grey hot
course its hot what do you want in it
nothing well data i must say this is a fine place you have here they certainly treat professors pretty well at cambridge
holding the lucasian chair does have its perquisites this house originally belonged to sir isaac newton when he held the position its become the traditional residence
here you go
thank you
if youre really his friend youll get him to take that grey out of his hair looks like a bloody skunk
jessel she can be frightfully trying at times but she does make me laugh
data what is it with the hair anyway
i found that a touch of grey adds an air of distinction
you say this is earl grey id swear that it was darjeeling

captain how long has it been since youve seen a physician about your irumodic syndrome
a week theyve prescribed peridaxon
but sir peridaxon
yes i know its not a cure theres nothing that can prevent the deterioration of the synaptic pathways you think that im senile that all this is just a delusion
now come on captain no one said anything of the kind
in all honesty captain the thought has occurred to me however theres nothing to disprove what youre saying so its possible something is happening to you the first thing we should do is run a complete series of neurographic scans we can use the equipment at the biometrics lab here on the campus jessel ask professor ripper to take over my lecture for tomorrow possibly for the rest of the week captain well get to the bottom of this
thats the data that i remember i knew i could count on you

commanding officer enterprise arriving

to captain jeanluc picard stardate 

you are hereby requested and required to take command

to take command of the uss enterprise as of this date signed rear admiral norah satie starfleet command

red alert all crew to battle stations

you heard him move
personal log stardate  recorded under security lockout omega three two seven i have decided not to inform this crew of my experiences if its true that ive travelled to the past i cannot risk giving them foreknowledge of whats to come

report
weve completed a full subspace scan of the ship and surrounding space weve detected no unusual readings or anomalies
with all due respect sir it would be helpful if we knew exactly what we were looking for
noted counsellor do you sense anything unusual on board the enterprise perhaps an alien presence that doesnt belong here maybe one operating on a level of intelligence far superior to our own
no sir im only aware of the crew and the families on board the ship
mister worf initiate a level two security alert on all decks until further notice
with all due respect sir im the security chief on this ship unless youre planning to make a change
no of course not lieutenant security alert two
aye sir
captain picard to the bridge please
were on our way chief

sir starfleet has just issued an alert it appears a number of vessels are moving toward the neutral zone between romulan and federation space
what kind of vessels
freighters transports all civilians none of them starfleet ships
this tells me that a large spatial anomaly has appeared in the neutral zone in the devron system
captain it could be a romulan trick to lure our ships into the neutral zone as an excuse for a military strike
starfleets cancelling our mission to farpoint station and ordering us to the neutral zone as soon as we leave the spacedock
no well proceed to farpoint
sir
you heard me
captain the security of the federation could be at stake
mister worf will you man your station
aye sir
captain perhaps if we understood your thinking if you could explain
ive no intention of explaining to anyone we will proceed with our mission to farpoint as planned chief obrien am i right in thinking that youre having a problem with the warp plasma inducers
thats right sir
well i know how to get them back online youre with me well be in main engineering

mister obrien will you use these specifications to bypass the secondary plasma inducer
you have to realise sir this isnt exactly my area of expertise the chief engineer should be making these modifications
but the chief engineer isnt on board mister obrien trust me i know you can do it all those years you spent as a child building those model starship engines they were well worth it
how did you know that sir
from your starfleet records
yes sir ill get right to these modifications fletcher tell munoz and lee to get up here right away
aye sir

we have to realign the entire power grid well all be burning the midnight oil on this one
that would be inadvisable
excuse me
if you attempt to ignite a petroleum product on this ship at zero hundred hours it will activate the fire suppression system which would seal off this entire compartment
that was just an expression
expression of what
a figure of speech i was trying to tell him that wed be working late
ah then to burn the midnight oil implies late work
thats right
i am curious what is the etymology of that idiom how did it come to be used in contemporary language
i dont know sir
commander data welcome on board its so very good to see you
it is good to see you too sir
i could use your help with the infuser array
certainly
as you can see were having difficulty with the plasma conduits
this will need a completely new field induction subprocessor it appears that we will be required to ignite the midnight petroleum sir
jeanluc whats going on

it happened again
a time shift
yes
what happened
its still a little vague but i can remember more this time it seems that every time i shift periods i can retain more memory at first it appeared that i was in the future years from now and then i was in the past just before our first mission
what is it
i just scanned his temporal lobe and compared it to the scan i performed just a few minutes before theres a thirteen percent increase in the acetylcholine of the hippocampus within a matter of minutes you have accumulated over two days worth of memories

counsellor do you remember when i first came on board the enterprise
yes
what happened after the welcoming ceremony
there was a reception in ten forward i introduced you to worf and the other senior officers
do you have any memory of my calling red alert in spacedock do you remember starfleet diverting us from farpoint to the neutral zone to investigate a spatial anomaly
no
it would appear there is a discontinuity between the time periods you described events in one time period would seem to have no effect on the other two
and yet in both the past and the present theres a report of the same anomaly in the devron system i find it hard to believe that thats a coincidence
for all i know i may find the same thing in the future
perhaps the anomaly is a temporal disturbance of some kind
how is all this related to your time shifting
these are all very important questions and perhaps i will find answers to them in the past but now we have a potentially dangerous threat from the romulans i want all departments to present a battle readiness report to me at oh eight hundred hours tomorrow morning dismissed
deanna its going to be a late night would you like to have some dinner first
actually i we have plans
oh i see im sorry ill see you in the morning
goodnight sir
worf

i want continuous subspace sweeps we may be able to detect a temporal disturbance
aye sir
will this time shifting when it happens i experience a momentary disorientation if that should happen during a crisis i want you to take command immediately number one
im sorry be prepared to take command aye sir
speaking of disorientation are you all right
im just a little distracted im fine
you have the bridge number one ill be in my ready room

come
milk warm a dash of nutmeg
whats this
a prescription a glass of warm milk and eight hours uninterrupted sleep
beverly
doctors orders youre exhausted look i dont know whether youve slept in the past or in the future but im sure you havent slept in the present now get some rest or ill have you relieved and sedated
yes sir what hey beverly
as a physician its often my job to give people unpleasant news to tell them that they need surgery or that they cant have children or that they might be facing a difficult illness
but you said yourself that this is only a possibility
but youve been to the future you know its going to happen
i prefer to look on the future as something which is not written in stone a lot of things can happen in twenty five years

a lot of things can happen
captain

captain wake up
yes what is it have we reached the neutral zone
the neutral zone
sorry i was in the past again whats going on
datas arranged for us to run those tests on you in the biometrics lab were ready to go if you are
no no no no we have to get to the neutral zone
the neutral zone why
in the other two time periods starfleet reported a sort of a spatial anomaly in in in the devron system in devron system in the neutral zone
captain
if the anomaly appeared there in the past then it might be here too and we have to find out
just because youve seen it in two other time frames doesnt mean that its going to be here
but if it is here then it means something damn it geordi i know what we have to do
all right okay but first there is no neutral zone remember
right right klingons in this time period the klingons have taken over the romulan empire
right now relations between us and the klingons arent too cosy
i know that i havent completely lost my mind you know
well if were going to the devron system were going to need a ship
right now i think its time to call in some old favours contact admiral riker starbase two four seven

jeanluc you know id like to help but frankly what youre asking for is impossible the klingons have closed their borders to all federation starships
will if this spatial anomaly really is in the devron system
i saw a report from starfleet intelligence this morning on that sector there is no activity there is nothing unusual going on in the devron system
well i dont believe it what if their long range scanners are faulty we have to go there and see for ourselves
look ive got the yorktown out near the border ill have her run some long range scans in the devron system if she finds out anything ill let you know
will that is just not good enough
its going to have to be im sorry its all i can do riker out
computer restore holographic image

damn him anyway after all weve been through together hes been sitting behind that desk too long
captain im sorry i guess all we can do now is wait and see if the yorktown finds anything
there is another option we could arrange passage aboard a medical ship
medical ship
yes sir there was an outbreak of terrellian plague on romulus the klingons have been allowing federation medical ships to cross the border
yes yes
so what we need is a medical ship
i think i can arrange that data find the uss pasteur i have some pull with the captain at least i used to have


 well this is a page from the past i never thought id see either of you on a starship again
hello doctor
geordi
doctor
data

lets just choose one
all right

so did you get my message
yes jeanluc crossing into klingon territory its absurd but then i never could say no to you
oh so thats why you married me
well now the first order of business is to get clearance to cross the klingon border
agreed what about worf
yes thats it worf yes thats the answer worf will help us
data isnt worf still a member of the klingon high council
im not sure information on the klingon political structure is hard to come by these days however at last report worf was governor of hatoria a small klingon colony near the border
captain picard
yes
captain mckinley station is signalling they want to know when well be docking
tell mckinley weve been called away on a priority mission
aye sir
so you kept the name
ive prepared quarters for you on deck five you might want to get some rest
no im fine i dont need rest
nell please escort the ambassador to his quarters
look you are treating me as if i am an invalid i do have a few years left in me yet i do not want to be led around and i do not want to be patronised
youre right im sorry
now ill go and get some rest

how long since his last neurological scan
im not sure but i wouldnt try suggesting it he says hes not taking any more damn tests
do you really think hes moving through time  im not sure i do either but hes jeanluc picard and if he wants to go on one more mission thats what were going to do

well find the anomaly i know we will


report
were nearing the coordinates you gave me sir
is there anything unusual in the vicinity mister data
how would you define unusual sir every region of space has its own unique properties that cannot be found anywhere else
there should be a barrier of some sort nearby a large plasma field highly disruptive
nothing sir
this is the right time the right place he should be here now
who sir
q were here this has gone on long enough counsellor do you sense an alien presence
no sir
what is a q
its a letter of the alphabet as far as i know
i dont understand this is not the way its supposed to happen maintain this position ill be in my ready room


mon capitane i thought youd never get here
q i knew it whats going on
its judge q to you and isnt it obvious whats going on
the last time that i stood here was seven years ago
seven years ago how little do you mortals understand time must you be so linear jeanluc
you accused me of being the representative of a barbarous species
i believe my exact words were a dangerous savage child race
we demonstrated to you that mankind had become peaceful and benevolent you agreed and you let us go on our way now why am i standing here again
oh youd like me to connect the dots for you lead you from a to b to c so your puny mind can comprehend how boring theyd be so much more entertained if you tried to figure it out ill answer any ten questions that call for a yes or a no well
are you putting mankind on trial again
no
is there any connection between the trial seven years ago and whatevers going on now
id have to say yes
the spatial anomaly in the neutral zone is it related to whats happening
most definitely yes
is it part of a romulan plot a ploy to start a war
no and no five down
thats only four
is it a romulan plot is it a ploy to start a war those are separate questions
did you create the anomaly
no no no youre going to be so surprised when you realise where it came from if you ever figure it out
are you responsible for my shifting through time
ill answer that question if you promise you wont tell anyone  yes
why
sorry thats not a yes or no question you forfeit the rest of your questions i expected as much youre such a limited creature a perfect example of why we made our decision the trial never ended captain we never reached a verdict but now we have youre guilty
guilty of what
of being inferior seven years ago i said wed be watching you and we have been hoping that your apelike race would demonstrate some growth give some indication that your minds have room for expansion but what have we seen instead you worrying about commander rikers career listening to counsellor trois pedantic psychobabble indulging data in his witless exploration of humanity
weve journeyed to countless new worlds weve contacted new species we have expanded our understanding of the universe
in your own paltry limited way you have no idea how far you still have to go but instead of using the last seven years to change and to grow you have squandered them
we are what we are and were doing the best we can it is not for you to set the standards by which we should be judged
oh but it is and we have time may be eternal captain but our patience is not its time to put an end to your trek through the stars make room for other more worthy species
youre going to deny us travel through space
you obtuse piece of flotsam you are to be denied existence humanitys fate has been sealed you will be destroyed
q i do not believe that even you are capable of such an act
i there you go again always blaming me for everything well this time im not your enemy im not the one that causes the annihilation of mankind you are
me
thats right youre doing it right now you did it before and youll do it again
what sort of meaningless doubletalk is this
he doesnt understand i have only myself to blame i suppose i believed in you i thought you had potential but apparently i was wrong may whatever god you believe in have mercy on your soul this court stands adjourned

commander assemble the senior staff and go to red alert we have a bigger problem than i thought
red alert

i dont believe him this has to be another one of qs games hes probably listening to us right now getting a big laugh out of watching us jump through his hoops
normally i would agree with you but this time i feel that somehow it is different there was a deadly earnestness about him i think hes serious which means that in some fashion i am going to be the cause of the destruction of humanity
but didnt q say you already had caused it
and that you were causing it now
given the fact that there is an apparent discontinuity between the three time periods the captain has visited qs statement may be accurate if confusing
so what am i going to do lock myself in a room in all three different time periods
captain maybe not acting is what causes the destruction of mankind what if you were needed on the bridge at a key moment and you werent there
i dont think we can start second guessing ourselves i think we have to proceed normally and deal with each situation as it occurs
agreed ive been thinking about my conversation with q he admitted that he was responsible for my shifting through time now it occurred to me that he might be giving me a chance somehow to save humanity
what makes you say that
well hes always had a certain fascination with humanity with myself in particular i think he has more than a passing interest in what happens to me
that is true qs interest in you has always been very similar to that of a master and his beloved pet that was only an analogy captain
if i werent travelling through time i would never have realized that the anomaly in the neutral zone appeared there in the past as well assuming thats an important piece of a larger puzzle my ability to shift through time may be the key to understanding whats going on
captain picard
go ahead
were approaching the neutral zone captain
were on our way

all stop initiate long range scans
captain there are four warbirds holding position on the romulan side of the neutral zone
the federation starships concord and bozeman are holding position on our side
a face off the question is whos going to move first
we are mister worf hail the romulan flagship
the warbird terix is responding
on screen
captain picard

hello worf its been a long time
it is good to see you again
have you had a chance to read our request
yes but you must realise i am no longer a member of the high council
but surely worf you must still have some influence we have to get into the neutral zone cant you just get us permission to cross the border
i must refuse it is for your own safety the neutral zone is extremely volatile if admiral riker had given you a starship with a cloak you would have been safe it is hard to believe that even he would refuse to help you
i dont care what kind of ship we go in we have to get to the devron system
i am sorry my first duty is to the empire i must adhere to regulations
i know that im an old man and im out of touch but the worf that i remember was more concerned with things like honour and loyalty than rules and regulations but that was a long time ago maybe youre not the worf once i knew
dor sho gha you have always used your knowledge of klingon honour and tradition to get what you want from me
because it always works worf your problem is that you really do have a sense of honour and you really do care about trust and loyalty dont blame me for knowing you so well
very well you may cross the border but only if i come with you i am familiar with the neutral zone
terms accepted

inform transporter room two to beam the governor aboard i must make one thing very clear jeanluc if we run into any serious opposition im taking us back into federation territory we arent well armed and wouldnt last long in a fight
governor worf is aboard captain
all right set course for the devron system warp thirteen  once more for old times sake

engage

engage to where sir
set a course for the devron system and engage at warp nine
the devron system is inside the neutral zone sir
im aware of that lieutenant carry out my orders chief
aye sir
captain may i have a word with you in private
yes of course counsellor contact farpoint station i wish to speak with commander riker
aye sir

captain i just wanted to voice my concerns about the way the crew is responding to your unexpected orders
they dont trust me they think that im behaving erratically
some do others are confused it takes some time for a new crew to get to know their captain and for him to know them
i understand but i also know what this crew is capable of even if they dont
it would also help if they knew what was going on
i know its difficult operating in the dark but right now i dont think i have any other choice
yar to captain picard i have commander riker for you sir
excuse me put him through here commander riker i wanted to inform you that well be delayed in picking you up at farpoint station

i see may i ask how long
i cant say ill keep you updated will you inform doctor crusher and lieutenant la forge of our delay
understood
riker out
is there anything else counsellor
actually sir there is i was debating whether to mention it and perhaps its about commander riker
what about him
i think you should know he and i have had a prior relationship
i see do you think this will interfere with your duties
not at all it happened several years ago and its well behind both of us now i just thought you should know
i appreciate your telling me but im quite sure that the two of you will find some way to deal with the situation
thank you sir

tea earl grey hot
that beverage has not been programmed into the replication system

so captain how long shall we stare at each other across the neutral zone
there is an alternative tomolak we each know why were here we could each send one ship into the neutral zone to investigate the anomaly in the devron system
has starfleet command approved this arrangement
no
i like it already agreed one ship from each side but i warn you if another federation starship tries to enter the zone
there is no need to make threats we each know the consequences
very well ill see you in the devron system

helm set course for the devron system warp five
aye sir
engage

sensors are picking up a large subspace anomaly directly ahead
all stop on screen full scan mister data
aye sir
we have to get as much information as possible about that anomaly

we are approaching the devron system captain sensors are picking up a large subspace anomaly directly ahead
all stop on screen then it is larger in the past
sir
nothing full scan mister data
aye sir

on screen on screen lets see it

as you can see sir theres nothing there

still nothing captain ive conducted a full sensor sweep out to one light year from the pasteur no temporal anomalies no particle fluctuations nothing
i dont understand it was here in the other two time periods why isnt it here now
captain i have been monitoring klingon communication channels several warships have been dispatched to this sector to search for a renegade federation vessel
youre not thinking about leaving
theres nothing here jeanluc
there should be there has to be data is there some other way to scan for a temporal disturbance something that isnt covered in a normal sensor sweep
there are several methods of detecting temporal disturbances but were limited by the equipment on the pasteur
we should head back to federation territory
however it may be possible to modify the main deflector to emit an inverse tachyon pulse which could scan beyond the subspace barrier
thats it make it so
wait a minute data how long would this take
to make the modifications and search the entire devron system will take approximately fourteen hours
all right data begin to modify the tachyon pulse ensign chilton lay in a course back to the federation well stay here for six more hours and if we havent found anything were heading back maximum warp
aye sir
but six more hours may not be enough we have to stay here until we find it no matter how long it takes
carry out my orders may i see you a moment

beverly i cannot believe that you are not willing to stay here until we
dont you ever question my orders on the bridge of my ship again
damn it i was just trying to look there are larger concerns here what you dont understand is that
i understand that you would never have tolerated that kind of behaviour back on the enterprise and i wont here i dont care if youre my excaptain or my exhusband
youre right i was out of line it wont happen again but what you have to understand is what is at stake here q has said that all of humanity will be destroyed
i know thats why ive allowed us to stay here longer and keep looking but i also want you to allow for the possibility that none of what youre saying is real
what
jeanluc i care for you too much not to tell you the truth you have advanced irumodic syndrome its possible that all of this is in your mind ill stay here six hours longer and then were heading home i want you to remember if it were anyone but you we wouldnt even be here

eh what was that she said sonny i couldnt quite hear her
q what is going on here where is the anomaly
wheres your mommy well i dont know
answer me
there is an answer jeanluc but i cant hand it to you although you do have help
what help
youre not alone you know what you were and what you are to become will always with you
my time shifting the answer does lie there doesnt it now tell me one thing this anomaly were looking for will that destroy humanity
youre forgetting jeanluc you destroy humanity
by doing what when how can

report mister data
the anomaly is two hundred million kilometres in diameter it is a highly focused temporal energy source which is emitting approximately the same energy output as ten g type stars
what is the source of this energy
i am uncertain sir sensors are unable to penetrate the anomaly
what if we modified the main deflector to emit an inverse tachyon pulse that might be able to scan beyond the subspace barrier that might give us some idea of what the interior of this thing looks like
that is a most intriguing idea sir i do not believe a tachyon beam was ever used in such a way i had no idea you were so versed in the intricacies of temporal theory sir
i have some friends who are quite well versed in it make it so
i believe we can make the necessary modifications in main engineering sir

we can get more power if we reroute the primary eps taps to the deflector array
agreed initiating tachyon pulse
okay the pulse is holding steady were starting to receive data from the scan
it will take the computer some time to give us a complete picture of the anomalys interior i suggest we

geordi what is wrong
i dont know its like somebodys sticking an ice pick in my temples my visors picking up all kinds of electromagnetic fluctuations
data to sickbay medical emergency in main engineering

this is amazing the dna in his optic nerves is regenerating geordi its as if youre growing new eyes
how is this possible
it shouldnt be possible at all theres no medical explanation for spontaneous regeneration of an organ
doctor weve just gotten reports from two crewmembers who say they have old scars which are healing themselves
captain i believe i have a partial explanation i have completed my analysis of the anomaly it appears to be a multiphasic temporal convergence in the spacetime continuum
in english data
it is in essence an eruption of antitime
antitime
a relatively new concept in temporal mechanics the relationship between antitime and normal time is analogous to the relationship between antimatter and normal matter
so if time and antitime were to collide
they would annihilate one other causing a rupture in space i believe this is what happened in the devron system the rupture may be sending out waves of temporal energy which are disrupting the normal flow of time
data what could have caused this collision of time and antitime

antitime sir
i believe that if you modify the deflectors to send out an inverse tachyon pulse then youll find that the anomaly is a rupture between time and antitime
that is a fascinating hypothesis how did you formulate
i dont have time to discuss it now mister data do the modifications and send out the pulse then try working on a theory as to what caused this rupture mister obrien how large is this anomaly
approximately four hundred million kilometres in diameter sir
i dont understand why its bigger in the past
lieutenant you have the bridge ill be in my ready room
aye sir

whats going on
were under attack
shield strength down to fifty two percent minor damage to the port nacelle
two klingon attack cruisers decloaking to port and starboard
warp speed get us out of here
warp powers offline sir
heading one four eight mark two one five full impulse
impulse powers fluctuating shields down to thirty percent
weapons status
these weapons are no match for their shields
geordi we need more warp power now
im trying captain theyre too much for us i cant keep the phase inducers online
shields down to nine percent one more hit and theyll collapse
open a channel
open
this is captain beverly picard we are a medical ship on a mission of mercy please break off all  worf signal our surrender
tos vahcha worf dolo jegh

our shields have collapsed we are defenceless
captain another ship decloaking bearing two one five mark three one oh its the enterprise

theyre hailing us
on screen
i had a feeling you werent going to listen to me stand by ill see if i can get the klingons attention

the enterprise is drawing their fire
damage report
the warp core has been badly damaged theres a breach in progress
we have to stop it
the klingon ship is disengaging admiral riker is hailing us
our sensors indicate your ship has a warp core breach in progress prepare for emergency beam out


all the pasteurs crew are safely on board admiral
raise the shields where are the klingons
theyre still moving off sir half a light year away
theyll be back as i said i figured you wouldnt take no for answer  but i thought you had more sense than to send a defenceless ship across the border into hostile territory with no escort
if you had not turned down the captain when he came to you for help none of this would have happened unlike you i still have a sense of honour and loyalty
we dont have time for this the pasteurs core is going to breach
take us out of here full impulse

all right lets get out of here
no will we cant we have to save humanity
engage cloak
admiral we took a direct hit to the starboard plasma coil our cloak isnt functioning engineering reports itll be seven hours before we can cloak again
all right well do it the oldfashioned way set a course for the federation warp thirteen
will dont leave we have to stay here and find what is causing the temporal anomaly
we cant stay captain
we have to everything depends on it we cant leave now please listen to me




your visual acuitys improving by the hour geordi

im sorry alyssa may i take another look youll have a little tenderness for a few days thats to be expected

jeanluc ill be right back alyssa

alyssa lost the baby i think its the same phenomenon that affected geordi somehow the temporal energy from the anomaly caused the foetal tissue to revert to an earlier stage of development its as if the unborn child began to grow younger until finally the dna itself began to break down
how is she
physically shes fine for now but if this temporal reversion continues i dont think any of us are going to be fine for much longer
so this is affecting the entire crew
our cellular structures appear to be coalescing reverting to earlier forms in some cases this has caused old injuries to be healed but the effect is only temporary eventually may kill all of us

we have to find out how widespread this effect is contact starbase twenty three thats the nearest outpost have them check their personnel to see if there are any signs of temporal reversion
aye sir
mister data how close are you to completing the tachyon scan
approximately one hour forty five minutes sir
good when its done i want you to find some way of collapsing this anomaly without making things worse give me a risk analysis of whatever solution you come up with
aye sir
dismissed

its a pretty big decision jeanluc tinkering with an anomaly you know nothing about trying to collapse it isnt that risky
why will that cause the destruction of mankind
maybe on the other hand maybe leaving it alone would be the wrong thing to do its a pretty big decision all right would it help to have a different perspective

welcome home
home
dont you recognise your old stomping grounds this is earth france about oh three and a half billion years ago give or take an eon or two smells awful doesnt it all that sulphur and volcanic ash i really must speak to the maid
q is there any point to all this
look

so the anomaly is here too at earth
at this point in history the anomaly fills your entire quadrant of the galaxy
the further back in time the larger the anomaly
come here theres something i want to show you you see this

this is you im serious right here life is about to form on this planet for the very first time a group of amino acids are about to combine and form the first protein the building blocks of what you call life strange isnt it everything you know your entire civilisation it all begins right here in this little pond of goo appropriate somehow isnt it too bad you didnt bring your microscope its really quite fascinating oh look there they go the amino acids are moving closer and closer and closer oh nothing happened see what youve done
are you saying that i caused the anomaly and that the anomaly somehow disrupted the beginnings of life on earth
congratulations

lets concentrate on how this anomaly was initially formed speculation
our tachyon pulse has been unable to completely penetrate the anomaly if we had information on the centre of the phenomenon we might have a basis for speculation
is there any way that we can scan the interior
ive tried everything i know theres just too much interference theres nothing on board thatll do the job
do you know what could
in theory a tomographic imaging scanner capable of multiphasic resolution would be able to penetrate this much interference the daystrom institute has been working on such a device but it is still only theoretical


data do we have a tomographic imaging scanner on board
yes sir
can you use it to scan the interior of the anomaly
possibly  there is a great deal of interference but i am getting some readings this is very unusual
what is it
it appears that our tachyon pulse is converging with two other tachyon pulses at the centre of the anomaly the other two pulses have the exact same amplitude modulation as our own pulse it is as if all three originated from the enterprise
three pulses from three time periods converging at one point in space
captain what are you suggesting


computer where is admiral riker
admiral riker is in ten forward

the ship has held up pretty well over the years
they tried to decommission her about five years ago one of the advantages of being an admiral is you get to choose your own ship
will how long is this thing between you and worf going to go on
its been going on for over twenty years doesnt look like its going to end any time soon
i suspect the last thing counsellor troi would have wanted is for the two of you to be alienated
i agree i think its time to put it behind you
i tried at deannas funeral he wouldnt even talk to me
might have been tough for him then he took her death pretty hard
oh yeah well he wasnt the only one
i know but i think in his mind you were the reason that he and deanna never got together
i never did anything to stand in his way
didnt you will
did i i didnt want to admit that it was over i always thought that wed get together again and then she was gone you think you have all the time in the world until yeah

ensign how do i get to ten forward
its four decks down sir section zero zero five
thank you

oh my god
will will i know why its happening i know whats causing the anomaly we have to go back
the only place were going back to sir is bed
damn it will i know why its happening we caused the anomaly with the tachyon pulse it happened three times will we did it in three different time periods
i think youd better come with me
will you leave me alone damn it im not stupid will the tachyon pulses they were used in the same spot in three different time periods dont you see when the tachyon pulse used i mean i mean when the pasteur used the tachyon pulse then then we i mean everything started will we set everything in motion its like the chicken and the egg will the chicken and the egg we think it started in the past but it didnt it started right here in the future thats why its getting larger in the past
i think i know what the captains talking about if im not mistaken hes describing a paradox
yes right thats it
intriguing it is possible we couldve caused the very anomaly weve been looking for let us assume for a moment that the captain has been travelling through time let us also assume he has initiated an tachyon pulse at the same coordinates in space in all three time periods in that case it is possible that the convergence of three tachyon pulses couldve ruptured the subspace barrier and created an antitime reaction
i see where youre going data and because antitime operates opposite the way normal time does the effects would travel backwards through the spacetime continuum
yes thats why it gets larger in the past it grows as it travels backwards in time
all right just for the moment lets say that youre right what do we do
go back will we go back to the devron system
he may be right
if we go back to the devron system now we might be able to see the initial formation of the anomaly
riker to bridge set course for the devron system maximum warp
aye sir
worf we could use a hand

entering the devron system sir
full stop
sensors are picking up a small temporal anomaly off the port bow
on screen
i was right
its an antitime eruption it seems to have been formed within the last six hours
we must stop it here so it cant travel back through time
mister data we need a solution and we need it now
the anomaly is being sustained by the continuing tachyon pulses in the other two time periods i suggest shutting them down
the next time im there its the first thing ill do
isnt there something more we can do here to seal the rupture somehow
i will investigate the options

data disengage the tachyon pulse
sir
do it the convergence of the tachyon pulses from the three time periods is what is causing the anomaly
aye sir
is there any change in the anomaly

no sir
disengage the tachyon pulse
but e havent finished the scan sir
i know that but it is imperative that you disengage the tachyon pulse immediately
aye sir disengaging
why isnt the anomaly being affected
why would it be sir

ive shut off the tachyon pulses in the other time periods but it hasnt changed the anomaly
it remains unaffected here as well sir
what do we do
the only way to stop this things to repair the rupture at the focal point where time and antitime are converging
how do we do that
it would require taking the ship into the anomaly itself once inside we may be able to use the engines to create a static warp shell
yeah data thats right and the shell would act as an artificial subspace barrier separating time and antitime
collapsing the anomaly and restoring the normal flow of time but this would have to be done in the other two time periods as well
that could be a problem the anomalys so much larger in the other two time periods

it may be dangerous to take the ship in
take the ship in where sir
into the anomaly chief lay in a course for the exact centre and transfer all available power to the shields
sir can you give us some explanation
no lieutenant i cannot
captain so far weve obeyed every order no matter how far fetched it might have seemed but if were to risk the safety of the ship and crew i think we have to ask you for an explanation
i understand your concerns lieutenant and i know if i were in your position i would be doing the same thing looking for answers but youre not going to find any because i dont have any to give you i know it is difficult for you to understand but we have to take the ship into the very centre of the phenomenon and create a static warp shell now this will put the ship at risk quite frankly we may not survive but i want you to believe that i am doing this for a greater purpose and that what is at stake here is more than any of you can possibly imagine i know you have your doubts about me about each other about the ship all i can say is that although we have only been together for a short time i know that you are the finest crew in the fleet and i would trust each of you with my life so i am asking you for a leap of faith and to trust me
shields up maximum strength
boosting field integrity to the warp nacelles we may encounter shearing forces once we enter the anomaly
i am preparing to initiate a static warp shell
course laid in sir
all decks report ready sir
take us in chief

captain i have an idea if we take the ship to the centre of the anomaly and create a static warp shell
a static warp shell it could repair the barrier and collapse the anomaly
yes sir
mister data youre a clever man in any time period helm lay in a course for the centre of the anomaly and prepare to initiate a static warp shell
aye sir

the other two enterprises theyre on their way
very well ensign take us in

were entering the anomaly sir
all hands brace for impact
the temporal energys interfering with main power switching to

auxiliary power im having trouble keeping the impulse engines online ive got power fluctuations all across the board
maintain course and speed mister data how long until we reach the centre
at least thirty seconds sir

weve entered the anomaly

we have reached the centre sir
initiate warp shell

initiating static warp shell now

is it having any effect

something is happening a new subspace barrier appears to be forming
captain the sensors are picking up two other ships


captain it appears to be working the anomaly is beginning to collapse i think that
temporal energy is rupturing our warp containment system
we must eject the core
no we have to maintain the static warp shell as long as possible
were losing containment captain i cant stop it its going to


transfer emergency power to the antimatter containment system
im trying but theres a lot of interference
the warp shell is definitely having an effect sir the anomaly is collapsing
i cant hold it the containment system is going
maintain position mister la


both of the other ships have been destroyed
two down one to go
data report
the anomaly is nearly collapsed
were losing containment
goodbye jeanluc im going to miss you you had such potential but then again all good things must come to an end
containment field is at critical im losing it



the continuum didnt think you had it in you jeanluc but i knew you did
are you saying that it worked we collapsed the anomaly
is that all this meant to you just another spatial anomaly just another day at the office
did it work
well youre here arent you youre talking to me arent you
what about my crew
the anomaly my crew my ship i suppose youre worried about your fish too well if it puts your mind at ease youve saved humanity once again
thank you
for what
you had a hand in helping me get out of this
i was the one that got you into it a directive from the continuum the part about the helping hand thought was my idea
i sincerely hope that this is the last time that i find myself here
you just dont get it do you jeanluc the trial never ends we wanted to see if you had the ability to expand your mind and your horizons and for one brief moment you did
when i realised the paradox
exactly for that one fraction of a second you were open to options you had never considered that is the exploration that awaits you not mapping stars and studying nebulae but charting the unknowable possibilities of existence
q what is it that youre trying to tell me

youll find out in any case ill be watching and if youre very lucky ill drop by to say hello from time to time see you out there


captain are you all right
mister worf whats the date
stardate 
is something wrong sir
no no no i think ill get back to bed i could use some sleep
captains log supplemental starfleet command reports no unusual activity along the neutral zone and there is no sign of a temporal anomaly it would appear that i am the only member of the crew to retain any knowledge of the events i experienced


take it
any time doctor
four hands in a row how does he do it
i cheat im kidding
you know i was thinking about what the captain told us about the future about how we all changed and drifted apart why would he want to tell us whats to come
sure goes against everything weve heard about not polluting the time line doesnt it
i believe however this situation is unique since the anomaly did not occur there have already been changes in the way this time line is unfolding the future we experience will undoubtedly be different from the one the captain encountered
maybe thats why he told us knowing what happens in that future allows us to change things now so that some things never happen

agreed

come in
am i too late
of course not pull up a chair
whats the game
five card draw deuces wild

come

is there a problem sir
no i er i just thought that i might erm i might join you this evening if theres room
of course have a seat
would you care to deal sir
oh er thank you mister data actually i used to be quite a card player in my youth you know i should have done this a long time ago
you were always welcome
so five card stud nothing wild and the skys the limit
