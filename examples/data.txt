 doctor i must confess i am uncertain as to why someone falling into freezing water is amusing
 fun
 i do not understand
 got it
 sensors show five life signs aboard the station captain
 i was attempting to get into the spirit of things i thought it would be amusing spot is she still angry
 i have considered it for many months in the light of my recent episode with doctor crusher now would be the appropriate time
 that is true however i believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse for thirtyfour years i have endeavoured to become more human to grow beyond my original programming still i am still unable to grasp such a basic concept as humour this emotion chip may be the only answer geordi
 agreed
 i believe this beverage has provoked an emotional response
 i am uncertain because i have had little experience with emotion i am unable to articulate the sensation
 ouf
 yes that is it i hate this
 yes i hate this it is revolting
 please
 ha ha ha i get it ha ha ha i get it
 when you said to commander riker the clown can stay ha ha ha but the ferengi in the gorilla suit has to go ha ha ha
 during the farpoint mission we were on the bridge and you told the joke that was the punch line ha ha ha
 i know i just got it ha ha ha ha ha very funny ha ha ha
 there appears to be a dampening field in operation i cannot scan beyond the bulkhead
 it appears to be magnetically sealed i believe i can reverse the polarity by attenuating my axial servo open sesame you could say i have a magnetic personality ha ha ha humour i love it
 no geordi i have not have you no i have not it is most unusual ha ha ha mister tricorder ha ha ha
 make it so
 i cannot help myself i think that something is wrong
 i believe the emotion chip has overloaded my positronic relay
 please please do not hurt me please
 i  i cannot sir
 according to our information the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through this galaxy every thirtynine point one years it will pass through this sector in approximately fortytwo hours
 sorry sir it will take the computer a few moments to compile the information
 no sir i am finding it difficult to concentrate i believe i am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse regret concerning my actions on the observatory
 i wanted to save geordi but i experienced something i could not expect fear i was afraid according to our current information the destruction of the amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector gamma emissions have increased by point zero five percent the starship bozeman was forced to make a course correction ambient magnetic fields
 the destruction of the amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout this sector as a result any ship passing through this region would have to make a minor course correction
 this is its current position
 captain i cannot continue with this investigation i wish to be deactivated until doctor crusher can remove the emotion chip
 no sir i simply do not have the ability to control these emotions
 sir i no longer want these emotions deactivating me is the only viable solution
 no i cannot
 yes sir i will try sir
 i believe so
 no sir i will make the appropriate adjustments
 our records show that every ship which has approached the ribbon has either been destroyed or severely damaged
 yes sir there are two in the veridian system
 it should be noted sir that the collapse of the veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at amargosa
 veridian three is uninhabited however veridian four supports a preindustrial humanoid society
 two hundred thirty million sir
 approximately fortyseven minutes sir
 me sir
 i am sorry i let you down i have not been behaving like myself lately
 i would be happy to sir i just love scanning for lifeforms life forms you tiny little lifeforms you precious little life forms where are you
 hull breach on decks thirtyone through thirtyfive
 perhaps yes yes if we sent a lowlevel ionic pulse it might reset the coil and trigger the cloaking device excellent idea sir
 no problem
 i have accessed their coil frequency initiating ionic pulse
 yes mm
 one minute to warp core breach
 separation complete
 core breach in progress
 oh shit
 i have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters im attempting to level our descent
 i have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters im attempting to level our descent
 it has been extremely difficult counselor
 at first i was unprepared for the unpredictable nature of the emotions however having experienced two hundred and sixtyone distinct emotional states i believe i have learned to control my feelings they will no longer control me
 spot im very happy to see you spot
 i am uncertain counselor i am happy to see spot and yet i am crying perhaps the chip is malfunctioning
 hello spot
 difficult simply solve the mystery of farpoint station
 inquiry the word snoop
 possibility a kind of human behaviour i was not designed to emulate
 ah to seek covertly to go stealthily to slink slither
 glide creep skulk pussyfoot gumshoe
 it registers as solid captain
 inadvisable at any warp speed sir
 it is possible sir but absolutely no margin for error
 heading three five one mark eleven sir
 hostiles velocity is already warp nine point six sir shall i put them on the main viewer
 magnifying viewer image
 engine room attempting to comply sir but they caution us
 projection sir we may be able to match hostiles nine point eight sir but at extreme risk
 starship separation in six five four three two one
 separation is successful sir
 reverse power decelerating
 historically intriguing captain very very accurate
 at least we are acquainted with the judge captain
 if i may captain objection your honour in the year  the new united nations declared that no earth citizen could be made to answer for the crimes of his race or forbears
 uncertain when he froze lieutenant torres on the bridge we had our sickbay to help thaw him out
 yes sir the captain had asked the question can we assume you mean this will be a fair trial and in reply the judge stated yes absolutely equitable
 what is present course conn
 confirm we are on that heading sir
 aye sir into the standard parking orbit
 message from the saucer module sir it will arrive here in fifty one minutes
 the saucer module is now entering orbit with us sir
 they say you will be doing this manually sir no automation
 no sir but at your age sir i thought you shouldnt have to put up with the time and trouble of a shuttlecraft
 sir
 sorry sir if that subject troubles you
 one hundred thirty seven years admiral according to starfleet records
 i remember every fact i am exposed to sir
 no sir im an android
 i thought it was generally accepted sir that vulcans are an advanced and most honourable race
 yes sir
 i will sir
 marvellous how easily humans do that i still need much practice
 i shall endeavour to function adequately sir
 yes sir a wise procedure sir always
 no sir starfleet class of  honours in probability mechanics and exobiology
 machine correct sir does that trouble you
 understood sir prejudice is very human
 i am superior sir in many ways but i would gladly give it up to be human
 ah intriguing
 this woodland pattern is quite popular sir perhaps because it duplicates earth so well coming here almost makes me feel human myself
 much of it is real sir if the transporters can convert our bodies to an energy beam then back to the original pattern again
 correct sir the rear wall
 were right next to it
 i cant see as well as geordi sir but so far the material seems rather very ordinary
 construction records show this to be almost identical to that which starfleet uses
 commander something down here is shielding our communicators
 negative but something similar
 are you undamaged
 all systems operating
 unlikely sir our records show that you supervised all bandi contact with other worlds
 most interesting sir
 but no sound of power no equipment
 most intriguing again sir the place that this vessel was firing upon was not the farpoint starbase but the home of those who constructed sorry sir i seem to be commenting on everything
 and firing not on the new space station but on the bandi and their city
 ready for departure sir
 ss tsiolkovsky repeat your message
 captain what we just heard is impossible
 i believe that last sound we heard was an emergency hatch being blown
 indications of what humans would call a wild party
 correction sir thats blown out
 a common mistake sir
 i am already listed in several biomechanical texts doctor
 specifics sir
 ah the body geordi discovered
 to someone somewhere
 about that sir did the doctor believe i was boasting
 at least several hours but what i said was a statement of fact perhaps she will look it up
 can you provide more information sir seeking an instance of someone showering in his or her clothing is
 why should anyone wish to expend his time in such a search
 ah a human proverb as in folklore or an historical allusion or tribal memories
 enterprise history aberrant behavior medical cross reference
 aye sir downloading
 inquiry sir snootful
 captain another fortyone minutes will see the information from the tsiolkovsky downloaded to us
 slow sir the tsiolkovsky has been eight months in accumulating it
 like a full collapse sir any stellar material it threw this way we could still outrun on half impulse power
 confirmed sir and there was a rather peculiar limerick being delivered by someone in the shuttlecraft bay i am not sure i understand it there was a young lady from venus whose body was shaped like
 did i say something wrong
 yes sir
 lieutenant yar
 captain picard ordered me to escort you to sickbay lieutenant
 i am sure he meant now so you need time to get into uniform
 chronological age no i am afraid i am not familiar with
 i am sorry i did not know
 of course but
 in every way of course i am programmed in multiple techniques a broad variety of pleasuring
 fully captain
 we are more alike than unlike my dear captain i have pores humans have pores i have fingerprints humans have fingerprints my chemical nutrients are like your blood if you prick me do i not leak
 nice to see you wesley
 ah a game
 no this will take slightly more time than we have sir
 if we just had one minute more sir
 thirteenth century sir
 with their orbital control station sir
 it reads similar to early starfleet efforts but uses the heglenian shift to convert matter and energy in different turns which is actually not important at this time
 if i may sir one of the things about them in the briefing studies was their respect for patience
 it is a highly structured society in which people live by strict codes of honour for example what lutan did is similar to what certain american indians once did called counting coup thats from an obscure language called french counting coup
 indeed but surely sir
 yes sir counting coup could be as simple as touching an enemy with a stick in battle or taking something from him and escaping it was considered extremely heroic
 transmission from the planet surface sir main viewer on
 politely captain
 agreed sir their customs concerning guests make it much preferable
 except that ligonian custom makes it clear that a visiting leader becomes an honoured guest not us not second in command him
 why that razor my friend why not the one i adjusted to perfect efficiency
 puzzling how can anything be too efficient
 we always come back to the human equation
 constantly my friend particularly the humour a man goes to a store to buy some kidneys
 he says to the shopkeeper id like a pound of kiddillies please the shopkeeper says to him you mean kidneys dont you the man says i said kiddillies diddle i
 how do you know when something is funny
 perhaps it is you geordi includling the kiddillies ive learned six hundred sixty two jokes and you have not
 it was not meant as a joke the tongue slipped
 from any particular point of view sir
 most interesting could this be human joke number six hundred sixty three
 which makes it important to know which of these weapons are to be used
 i may not understand human humour sir but i am a starfleet academy graduate
 understanding the prime directive sir
 and light as if they were made for women to use
 uncertain sir however joined together they would make a rectangle or square enclosing one hundred twenty one square metres if put end to end vertically they would make a pole forty four metres high or two of twenty two
 youre welcome sir
 most interesting do you
 was i seen leaving
 captain picard wanted no risk of our communications being overheard you are to proceed now as he indicated
 im here to brief you on what he plans
 legends which are totally unsupported by fact captain
 a message from planet haven counsellor they wish to beam the miller wedding party aboard
 on the viewer captain unidentified vessel travelling subwarp speed bearing two three five point seven
 if you mean a tarellian vessel sir it is
 tarella was class m much like your earth with similar humanoid life forms unfortunately they faced the old story of hatred out powering intelligence
 between the inhabitants of their two land masses resulting in one group unleashing a deadly biological weapon on the other
 exactly thirteen hours nine minutes twenty two seconds three hundred fifty
 considering the rate at which you imbibe sir is your lineage at all mixed with human
 sir
 perhaps being human yourself sir you do not find them as intriguing as i
 mrs troi im very interested in the betazed ceremony you mentioned could you tell us more
 could you please continue the petty bickering i find it most intriguing
 because our sensors are showing a responder echo sir on the frequency they once used
 theyre within transporter range sir
 unless they have all died their ship could have been brought in by automation
 sir we put mister kosinskis specs into the computer and ran a controlled test on them there was no improvement in engine performance
 its off the scale sir
 captain no one has ever reversed engines at this velocity
 malfunction i trust
 two million seven hundred thousand light years
 you must sir our comparisons show it to be completely accurate
 which traveling subspace they should receive in fiftyone years ten months nine weeks sixteen days
 sir
 captain were here why not avail ourselves of this opportunity for study there is a giant protostar here in the process of forming no other vessel has been out this far
 according to the instruments sir our speed never exceeded warp one point five
 where none have gone before
 warp one point five sir which is what my instruments have read all along
 sleigh ride
 warp five sir
 listed as delphi ardu sir eleven planets unexplored
 possibility a malfunction in their engines sir
 nothing specific sir as you know ferengi technology is estimated to be generally equal to our own
 correct sir we are no doubt advanced in some areas they in others
 mostly electromagnetic sir fusion generator and batteries down by thirty percent
 they are slowing too sir
 sir something is dragging us forward
 captain this shouldnt be our ships power systems are failing
 none sir only hearsay and third hand reports most of which conflict
 that the ferengi are well the best description may be traders
 a comparison modern scholars have drawn from earth history likens the ferengi to the oceangoing yankee traders of eighteenth and nineteenth century america sir
 who in this case sail the galaxy in search of mercantile and territorial opportunity
 hardly sir i believe this analogy refers to the worst quality of capitalists the ferengi are believed to conduct their affairs of commerce on the ancient principle caveat emptor let the buyer beware
 well sir i doubt they wear red white and blue or look anything like uncle sam
 and the german nation red black and gold the italians green white and red the british
 it was you who
 given what is now happening to our ship sir their weapons could be vastly superior to ours
 captain i think you had better see this
 someone is reading every file every bit of information stored in the enterprise memory banks
 and more perhaps
 open sir
 hailing frequencies open sir
 sotto voce to geordi fortunately starfleet has no such rules involving our second officers
 as requested captain library computer information on this planet it has been charted only from long range scans it is class m but shows no indications of life forms sentient or otherwise however you may find this of interest resolving it into our language
 the centre of a huge space federation a population of trillions
 understandable it has been extinct six hundred thousand of our his forefingers are stuck in the puzzle of our years these planets were once outposts of that empire
 apologies captain i seem to have reached an odd functional impasse i am stuck
 yes sir that is what i am trying to do sir but the solution eludes me
 intriguing it describes the empire as being highly advanced and powerful and capable of actually moving stars
 correct sir outposts the planet below was possibly one of them
 their sun went supernova sir
 this planet may have been the most distant outpost sir but it shows no life form readings
 yankee trader
 especially in view of the fact the image he transmitted sir was somehow distorted
 with this power drain we may have trouble communicating with the enterprise sir
 due to this forcefield there is presently no way to beam us back sir
 most intriguing sir i assume a problem of inaccurately transmitted programme coordinates due to the force field around the ship sir are we alone sir
 crystalline mostly inert nothing to write home about
 slang sir i did use it correctly did i not
 what
 tricorders useless sir communications gone too fortunately you did not break any
 holding one aloft careful commander theyre much stronger than
 i believe we can deduce that these crystalline tree shapes are actually energy collectors
 it is a matter of record portal in the age of makto the central star of the tkon empire destabilised and
 in fact there have been many ages which have come and passed since makto
 im afraid not according to the tkon use of galactic motionary startime charts after bastu came cimi xora makto
 they should add that starfleet has permitted several civilisations to fall we have at times allowed the strong and violent to overcome the weak
 something to write home about
 sir my sensors are picking up an unusual energy object ahead
 also travelling at warp speed sir intriguing i can find no match with anything in our records sir
 aye sir
 no life form reading sir
 sir it is changing shape
 negative captain energy only
 a mystery is only a mystery as long as it remains uninvestigated sir
 intriguing doctor what does helm control have to do with medical crosschecks
 is something wrong doctor
 captain there is a malfunction in this station i cannot bring any information up on it science two does not function either sir
 it is a virtual impossibility sir
 sir subspace radio is out
 if the enterprise were really this fragile sir she never would have left spacedock therefore her systems failures are not endemic to the ship but are the result of the actions of an unknown adversary
 i believe i said that
 ferengi contacts have been detected on both selay and antica sir
 inquiry private eye
 a most interesting occupation
 smoking a meerschaum pipe imprecise lieutenant they omitted certain truths which in itself tells us something
 indubitably my good woman
 has studied sir every case as holmes wouldve pointed out during the time in question something was afoot
 while both sets of delegates say they were in their quarters our crew locator sensed them passing here and here
 on the contrary dear colleague on their return they drew medical supplies appropriate to the treatment of minor wounds and abrasions on these life forms
 exactly that they were too engaged in their own affairs to have disabled our ship and murdered the engineer given a choice theyd rather kill each other than any of us its elementary my dear riker sir
 yes sir if you wish sir but i ask if youd take it as incontrovertible that it cannot be a family member or one of our crew
 then our investigation was worthwhile sir we have eliminated both the delegates and the ships regular complement
 i am referring to the great detectives credo sir i quote we must fall back on the old axiom that when other contingencies fail whatever remains however improbable must be the truth
 yes since we obtained only minimal information on our sensor pass of it
 a mere change of direction hardly justifies mutiny
 and at the moment it is all pure speculation he has done nothing to subject the enterprise to danger
 i understand as an energy pattern free of the limitations of matter he might travel anywhere at any velocity
 sir i see no way for you to journey with an energy form
 still no readings no sign of anything
 sir the entity was caught in the ships circuitry the captain might try to get in the same way if hes in trouble
 just as before going to worf first
 hes in the ships circuitry come to the transporter room please there might be a way sir hurry
 i knew we had to have the captains physical pattern here sir he was the last one to beam out
 unknown at this time sir i hope the captain remembers his physical pattern is here if he has his energy has moved into the transporter relays by now
 energising sir
 i believe the captain is now his separate self sir much of what happened is naturally missing
 indubitably sir indubitably
 but there is a problem here sir
 im reading something off the starboard bow but there is nothing there
 ive traced it through our sensor channel sir it is not a glitch or any other form of error or malfunction
 exactly as if it were neither in or out of our dimension
 whatever is sitting out there without triggering our alarm relays sir
 enterprise to object off our starboard bow request that you identify yourself
 it was something unintelligible captain now running it through language and logic circuits
 ive got some information on its first transmission sir it translates as stand by
 verified sir something very small
 the away team signals been cut off captain weve lost contact with our people
 the colony we just planted sir
 captain i do not understand how but it is asking me if i was constructed for information exchange
 i was an excellent choice for them captain they were able to communicate with me quite i was about to say quite easily but there was nothing easy about it fortunately they stopped short of overloading my circuitry
 definitely not a single entity if thats what you mean sir although they know the edo worship them as a god thing
 they recognise that this is quite expected and harmless at the present edo stage of evolution
 it is perhaps not what we would understand as a vessel sir the dimensions this one occupies allows them to be well to be in several places at once but they consider this entire star cluster to be theirs it was probably unwise of us to attempt to place a human colony in this area of course there are three thousand four other planets in this star cluster in which we could have colonised the largest and closest
 babble sir im not aware that i ever babble sir it may be that from time to time i have considerable information to communicate and you may question the way i organise it
 undecided sir
 i volunteer that they are now observing us sir
 no it is more curiosity sir i doubt that they expect us to abide by their value systems
 they know everything i know sir
 it would be a case of judging us by our own rules sir if we violate our own prime directive they might consider us to be deceitful and untrustworthy you do recall they cautioned us not to interfere with their children below what has happened
 most interesting sir the emotion of motherhood compared to all others felt by
 you were right sir i do tend to babble
 you sent for me sir
 yes sir
 what level of communication sir
 but i do sir
 the problem sir is there the edo vessel although theyve learned of the prime directive from my mind how will they evaluate it how do they reason what are their values remember their warning to us sir
 would you choose one life over one thousand sir
 any sufficiently advanced life form would appear to others to be that sir but when they were probing my thoughts captain i could feel that whatever they are now they once existed in this dimension just as we do perhaps in the same kind of flesh and blood form since then however they have evolved considerably their present existence in multidimensions no doubt has advantages we do not understand
 we know the edo share them sir
 perhaps the edo are a child race by comparison possibly a race which those life forms have planted here much as we plant human colonies on classm planets
 aye sir
 captain
 boosting it how catches picards eye we will discuss this later
 time sir
 secondhand sir oh of course a human joke
 captain he may refer to an incident which occurred nine years ago in the maxia zeta star system in which an unidentified starship
 which you destroyed sir
 hardly a mistake sir your report shows that it deliberately attacked
 you performed what starfleet textbooks now refer to as the picard manoeuvre
 sir the ferengi are standing by for us to take possession of the stargazer
 reading the plaque uss stargazer constellation class starfleet registry ncc 
 youll find this most intriguing sir
 the last entry dated nine years ago sir by you reading screen we are forced to abandon our starship may she find her way without us apparently she did sir
 starfleet has responded to our request sir a tug will rendezvous with us and tow the stargazer back to xendi starbase nine
 the records of the stargazer sir what the ferengi call the battle of maxia it seems the captains personal log contains a much different version of that conflict than the official historic account
 it would appear that the starship which captain picard attacked had in fact been under a flag of truce
 and apparently the captain destroyed the ship without notice or provocation
 an accident in engineering
 it is logged in his own voice sir would you care to hear it sir sir
 by comparing the stargazers main computer log with captain picards personal log i have found checksum discrepancies sir
 all information is timecoded by entry and the bits when totaled produce an aggregate amount which
 one of these two logs is a forgery sir
 as i said that is one of them is it not
 yes sir whoever tampered with your personal log was clever
 sir
 i have a fix on it sir inside captain picards quarters
 considerable fire damage to interior surface reported sir but none of her main systems were crippled
 there is no defence sir
 i have computed a possibility commander since even deep space contains trace gases sir a vessel in the picard manoeuvre might seem to disappear but our sensors could locate any sudden compression of those gases
 this class starship has enough power to use our tractor beam on it seize it limit its field of fire
 no question of it sir
 which will bring us to the colony in three point two hours sir
 the q entity sir it is identical to the grid we encountered when
 obviously a class m world gravity and oxygen within our limits
 considering the power demonstrated by q the last time anywhere assuming this place even exists
 sir what he has in mind might provide us with vital information
 that is what humans call a truism
 this is from europes napoleonic era sir late eighteenth early nineteenth centuries this is a campaign headquarters tent his uniform is that of a french army marshal
 the third ridge
 muskets are appropriate to the  to  french army uniform sir but it is hardly a weapon by our standards a lead ball propelled by gunpowder one hundred metres at best with any accuracy
 you may find it aesthetically displeasing sir i could just file a computer report on that
 and the reason for that sir
 in orbit of quadra sigma three sir ready to beam down rescue team to underground emergency area
 this way sir
 sir if indeed you have the power of q
 are you certain sir
 no no sir
 yes sir that is true but i never wanted to compound one illusion with another it might be real to q perhaps even you sir but it would not be so to me was it not one of the captains favourite authors who wrote this above all to thine own self be true sorry commander i must decline
 sir how is it that the q can handle time and space so well and us so badly
 mordan has had peace for five years they have finally come to a state of productivity which satisfies their planetary needs but no more than that perhaps the dissidents feel the federation could provide them with more
 aye sir
 aye sir frequency open and secured
 aye sir
 i have it sir
 i am sorry sir that does not correspond with the information in my tricorder sir jameson your information is incorrect commander i know these tunnels like the back of my own hand keep scanning for signs of human life forms karnas held his hostages in these tunnels before hell do it again
 captain the admiral is definitely incorrect the tunnel schematics we have show this to be a dead end it was sealed off two years ago
 their phasers sir set on kill
 no sign of a wound
 an ancient earth device used primarily for transportation
 also seen as a source of status and virility often a prime ingredient in teenage mating rituals
 city block
 shall i tell him sir
 yes if on the other hand the captain makes even the slightest error
 we are all aware of the tape of the last federation starship to come in contact with the jaradan it graphically demonstrates what happened when that captain offended them
 should we not rerun it
 why would the captain not want to review all available information on the subject
 this dixon hill is a most puzzling character
 ah but was his modus operandi not dissimilar worth investigating
 computer request all biographical information on fictional character dixon hill
 request complete text of all stories involving said character increase speed
 request permission to accompany you sir i am totally versed in the genre of the period
 dimaggio sir jolting joe the yankee clipper
 the streak they refer to will eventually reach fifty six games and be snapped by a pair of journeyman hurlers for the cleveland indians
 the record will stand until the year  when a shortstop for the london kings
 cat
 bogart hiya doc whats cooking
 hes on ice
 hes being grilled
 yeah me too boss id love to take a gander
 computer identify exit
 there is a programming malfunction the computer refuses to identify the exits
 i am at a loss sir we are in a holodeckcreated building of  the computer refuses to accept voice commands the controls for the environment are therefore not accessible
 your devotion to etiquette is highly admirable sir however your methods leave much to be desired
 i was created on a planet
 south america
 he speaks the truth sir from your point of view he is only a facsimile a knockoff a cheap imitation
 sorry sir that did not come out quite the way i intended
 it is you who are not real sir
 it is you who are imaginary characters derived from a work of fiction
 i am afraid you are not real either lieutenant
 an electronic or mechanical apparatus capable of carrying out repetitious or complex mathematical operations at high speed computers are used to control process perform or store
 if you were going to go through yourself sir that is not possible
 with your permission sir
 and you sir
 it was raining in the city by the bay a hard rain hard enough to wash the slime
 sorry sir
 angel one is a class m planet sir supporting carbon based flora and fauna sparsely populated with intelligent life forms it is similar in technological development to midtwentieth century earth
 five months fourteen days eleven hours two minutes
 and fifty seven seconds
 angel one has evolved into a constitutional oligarchy it is governed by a parliamentary body consisting of six elected mistresses and headed by a female they refer to as the elected one
 a federation vessel last visited this planet sixty two years ago captain
 what do we do if they deny the existence of survivors
 interesting an alcoholbased synthetic artificially reproducing a floral scent
 the purpose of which is
 i am unfamiliar with that term
 how does stimulation of the olfactory nerves affect the enjoyment of sex
 if we can isolate something unique to the odin survivors perhaps an element not otherwise found on angel one we can utilise the enterprise scanners
 i am an android mistress although anatomically i am a male
 a justified precaution counsellor mistress beata observed that mister ramsey and his men are dangerous
 actually it was quite simple angel one has no platinum enterprise scanners did the rest
 mister ramsey is correct counsellor the odin was not a starship which means her crew is not bound by the prime directive if he and the others wish to stay here there is absolutely nothing we can do about it
 doctor crusher feels the virus will undoubtedly run unchecked through the entire ship attempts to develop an inoculants have so far ended in failure lieutenant la forge still has bridge command pending your return sir
 the border outpost reports a contingent of seven romulan battlecruisers within sensor range the uss berlin has answered the distress call however should hostilities erupt both the outpost and the starship will be outgunned it is felt that the enterprises presence in the area will be a vital show of force
 excuse me commander but removing any of these people against their will would be a violation of several starfleet regulations not the least of which would be the prime directive
 this is data standing by to beam up
 oc enterprise to commander riker
 to be precise commander you ordered me to reach the neutral zone before it is too late
 after relieving lieutenant la forge i computed the length of time the border outpost
 and the uss berlin can safely withstand a romulan attack and deducted our time to destination at maximum warp speed that leaves doctor crusher forty eight minutes to develop an inoculants to the virus
 forty seven sir
 go ahead doctor
 bingo i fail to see the relevance doctor is that not a reference to an ancient earth game
 excellent doctor we still have seventeen minutes left i will inform the away team immediately enterprise to riker
 we are ready to have you beamed up commander
 understood commander
 sir
 ready to dock sir
 it is an attempt at pure creativity
 and this is my attempt with guidance from geordi
 i am awaiting inspiration
 this is commander data go ahead please
 can you be more specific
 the field is deteriorating contact the captain immediately i am initiating red alert
 engineering to captain no reply if the antimatter is released the ship will be destroyed
 computer situation analysis
 engineering to bridge
 alert starbase inform them we are abandoning the ship tell them why initiate automated sequence for departure set course and speed course and speed to put maximum distance between the enterprise and any inhabited planets
 there is no time
 based on all information presently available the decision is correct this is lieutenant commander data speaking for the captain abandon ship this is not a drill all personnel this is not a drill around the ship i say again abandon ship all personnel this is not a drill
 abandon ship
 computer where are the captain and commander riker
 curious the captain is usually the last to leave
 i hope we are
 no are they not here on starbase
 we have to beam back and get them
 which is the nearest starfleet vessel
 i know the trieste too small too slow
 where are the bynars
 they are obviously still aboard another starfleet vessel must be sent to intercept the enterprise at bynaus they might be taking the ship to their home planet
 it is the best place for us to start
 do you think i am responsible
 my station is on the bridge
 you are wrong geordi i can i do not need rest or diversion i should not have been painting i was negligent
 i am here sir
 the access would be available by code or password
 file names can be anything sir
 then a name or a place it could be something personal in this case in binary language which is ones and zeros in groups of eight or sixteen characters
 we are sensing lifeforms sir
 both matters are subjects of protracted discussion
 theories reports but nothing firsthand
 the efficiency of your hydraulic landscaping is quite elegant
 geordi this appears to be the master subsurface pump
 this is interesting the water table is a thin ribbon between the sandy surface layer and the rocks below
 which would require extreme precision from the probe controls
 go ahead geordi
 i will go with you
 geordi this is intriguing i have seen malfunctions
 but this is almost as if the laser drill seemed to operate itself with a will
 separate from its control console
 the laser blasts seemed to end when the yelling stopped
 not possible
 uncertain geordi please return power to the control console in this room i wish to reactivate the programme
 i am running the base drilling programme
 geordi servos off
 too much to explain
 bridge this is lieutenant commander data no need to beam me up sir the situation is under control
 yes
 no but the firing programme was dynamic
 it adjusted to my tactics it tracked with me anticipating a fixed programme could not have done that
 that is exactly how it appeared there was a mind working against me
 i had no choice
 we were attempting to trace the source of the malfunction when it attacked me
 it would appear the lasers drilling system was reprogrammed sir as soon as its memory bank received power it turned itself on and went after me fortunately i was able to cope with it
 i believe it was programmed to destroy any person moving in that room sir
 certainty
 but it was done
 what are we to look for sir
 geordi i need some visual assistance
 speculation could it be alive
 whatever it is it could be what they are covering up and the reason someone killed malencon
 its never been done doctor
 reproduction
 recheck analysis please
 it started after doctor crusher ordered the scanner to magnify
 unknown but it is definitely reacting to our presence perhaps it is picking up the electrical impulse of our systems
 without external influence
 unknown sir perhaps it is scanning us
 unknown at this time sir
 it is projecting an energy field
 only life can replicate itself doctor inorganic or not it is alive
 please show me the spectral analysis magnification twelve k
 transistor material
 emits charge when lit
 the universal translator is coming on line sir
 an accurate description of humans sir you are over ninety per cent water surrounded by a flexible container
 the translator is now offline sir
 sir that chaos when we were studying it in the lab must have been the energy surge of a reproductive cycle it is now a colony of single cells which organize as a computer and like any computer
 that seems to be its method of reprogramming captain each bolt of light consists of negatively and positively charged ions a series of programme instructions as it were it seems to have a quicker rapport with our computers than we have
 it does seem dormant captain
 environmental systems fail to respond to command captain it appears the microbrain has successfully interfaced with our computers
 it connected them
 the saline fluid is their circuitry and to prevent its loss they killed malencon
 captain our sensors indicate that the microbrain expends a tremendous amount of energy during its reproductive cycle yet there is no discernible power drain on our own systems
 meaning the microbrains might be photoelectric
 i wish we were able to learn more about them sir
 scanners still show nothing sir
 sensors indicate that the shield is electromagnetic a complicated light refracting mechanism
 aye sir
 the theory is simple the shield bends light rays around the planets contour similar to the romulan cloaking device but the implementation is quite difficult
 some sort of scanning device sir
 all decks being probed in a methodical pattern sir
 aye sir
 we may be more successful in deciphering the code they use to transport through the magnetic shield
 eventually sir i am working on it now but the number of permutations is almost endless
 i am not aware of regulation six point five seven
 i see sir oh i see sir
 i believe it was a repulsor beam
 that may be impossible sir
 yes sir
 captain
 these permutations are going to take a very long time
 weeks
 this is it commander it is programmed to accept only authorised voice command
 no but i can scramble the input so that nobody else can
 it is reading incredible amounts of energy sir even more since we have taken down the shield
 it worked well sir we have successfully reseeded the ozone layer but for their atmosphere to maintain its integrity they can never use the shield
 may i help you mister remmick
 atmospheric entry seventy eight seconds
 irrelevant sir even if he restarts his engine now he will not have enough thrust to escape impact
 twenty eight seconds to impact
 six seconds to impact
 yes sir
 yes sir
 all of the ships records are available to you sir
 loyalty is not the issue commander there is nothing wrong with captain picard or the ships logs therefore there must be something wrong with your original assumption
 acceptable or not sir it is the truth
 i have no reports of any federation ships in that area sir
 sir i have analysed the residue from the explosions this is of no known ferengi design it is possibly romulan
 i have located a vessel sir it is drifting
 the life support systems on the ship are failing sir propulsion navigation and all communication inoperative
 no sir
 yes sir
 i have identified the vessel captain it is the batris a general cargo vessel
 it has restrictions the information from geordis visor is so complex it is difficult to encode therefore the signal breaks down easily
 i am detecting high levels of deuterium gas probably from the leakage in the drive system
 not as yet sir the life signs are emanating from the far side of engineering
 all routes are equally dangerous sir
 there is no significant difference
 the citizens of minos gained fame during the ersalrope wars as arms merchants they manufactured sophisticated and highly advanced weaponry
 both
 captain readings correspond with the findings of the probe no signs of intelligent life forms vegetation and animal life only
 disease
 captain we are being hailed
 correct sir something has scanned our language banks and is hailing us
 it is a recorded message sir
 commander our communications are being monitored
 since there is no intelligent life the question is by what
 over here
 sir other than ourselves i am picking up no life signs here
 commander riker just has been encased in some kind of energy field
 unknown
 he appears to be in some kind of stasis
 typically the purpose of such an enclosure is for storage
 he is alive what appeared in the form of captain rice is
 the planet is vagra two sir in the zed lapis sector uninhabited
 strange sir theres no emergency signal from the shuttle as yet
 there is little information in the library computer other than the fact of its existence our sensor show no signs of life forms virtually no vegetation
 minimum for our needs sir
 no sir our sensors are not fully penetrating whatever the debris is
 yes sir i cannot explain
 inconclusive sir i cannot tell you what it is but i can tell you what it is not
 there is no evidence of neural or circulatory systems no internal organs cellular structure unknown it does not have any proteins which are known to us
 i do not know sir it does not appear to have a skeletal framework or musculature
 it appears to be following us sir
 insufficient information sir
 again insufficient information sir
 it is possible
 it seems to feed on our phaser energy
 she only wanted to get to troi and lieutenant prieto
 armus is capable of creating undefined forcefields in effect we are powerless to communicate or use the transporter unless it allows it
 it did not register on the tricorder
 no clearly you are some kind of intelligent form
 half metre to the right geordi
 no you will just move it again and i will not help you hurt him
 enterprise
 armus has enveloped commander riker
 i would guess that death is no longer sufficient entertainment to alleviate its boredom therefore commander riker is alive
 i have no control over what you do with the phaser therefore i would not be the instrument of his death
 no the control is still yours
 curious the phaser drops you are capable of great sadism and cruelty interesting no redeeming qualities
 i think you should be destroyed
 sir the purpose of this gathering confuses me
 my thoughts are not for tasha but for myself i keep thinking how empty it will feel without her presence did i miss the point
 engineering this is lieutenant commander data bring all systems online and direct full power to the shields
 all sections secure sir
 captain im reading an unusual number of sunspots and eruptive prominences sir the magnetic field is extremely irregular
 if we are to investigate sir we must get closer
 the transmission is coming from a freighter in orbit around the fourth planet in the system however the receiving station is on the third planet
 captain our sensors are being severely affected by the sun flares
 there are six life forms aboard the freighter sir
 i will attempt it sir
 sir i have determined what is malfunctioning on the freighter
 your ships design uses an electromagnetic coil to constrict the exhaust flow that coil is misaligned
 not very much sir the only recorded contact with the delos system was over two hundred years ago a scout ship reported two inhabited planets one of which was on the verge of acquiring space travel
 our computer has downloaded the specifications for the magnetic coils the freighters depend on assuming the malfunction is similar suitable replacements can be fabricated
 aye sir
 i would estimate four billion three hundred seventy five million
 no doubt you have applied your technology from other industries to the refinement of this product
 fascinating your society is dedicated exclusively to the production of a single product
 beginning several thousand years ago the two worlds took different paths ornara became technologically sophisticated brekka did not then two hundred years ago ornara was stricken by a devastating plague
 somehow and there is limited information on this point the cure was found in a plant indigenous to only brekka and which resisted all attempts at cultivation on ornara
 voluntary addiction to drugs is a recurrent theme in many cultures
 sensors show nothing sir but it appears a moment in time repeated itself exactly for everyone
 computers were also affected which would indicate the phenomenon was not an illusion but occurred in real time
 a highly respected scientist considered a visionary he advanced several timerelated theories one regarding the relationships between time and gravity was quite intriguing but neither that theory nor any other received wide acceptance
 actually sir that may be an incorrect analogy
 a hiccup is a spasmodic inhalation with closure of the glottis accompanied by a peculiar sound if we were to continue this analogy to a body function what occurred would be best represented by a
 all i have found sir is what you already know manheim was concentrating on time gravity experiments when he left
 sensors indicate it is vandor four a planetoid in elliptical orbit around the binary system
 no sir
 do you know the nature of doctor manheims work
 because of the dense gravity of the pulsar
 incidentally captain the effects of the time distortions are now being felt in the ilecom system
 incidentally captain the effects of the time distortions are now being felt in the ilecom system
 i feel no disorientation
 nor do i
 i believe what could be termed the manheim effect is becoming more pronounced
 oh we are us sir but they are also us so indeed we are both us at different points along the same time continuum
 we have completed a scan of the planet surface
 our sensors show an immense volume of energy emanating deep within the planet and concentrated near manheims remaining laboratory
 i cannot be sure sir but i believe manheim has developed a method for harnessing energy from the pulsar
 i would need to study manheims records
 i am fully versed sir on all your theories regarding time and gravity
 i am an android
 i am the only one sir
 then you have harnessed a dynamic energy source
 the range is at least several thousand light years
 if what the professor has given me is accurate it is possible to repair the damage but it must be perfectly timed to coincide with another time distortion episode
 i believe so sir
 if doctor manheims information is correct by my calculations the next time distortion should occur between twenty eight to forty seven minutes
 in both cases the time distortions occurred along the same continuum as a preview or a reprise of a specific point in time
 it is reasonable sir after all i am a machine and dispensable
 oh i see sir that is quite true sir i see time as a constant whereas humans perceive time as flexible hence the expression times flies when youre having fun which until now has always confused me
 sir
 i will go immediately sir
 enterprise
 i am proceeding to the lab sir
 aye sir
 doctor manheim forgot to mention one of his security precautions sir i am proceeding into the laboratory
 this appears to be the instrument doctor manheim described it should confirm when the next time effect will occur
 i will know in a moment sir according to calculations the next time effect will occur in one minute thirty seconds
 i will need to add a specific amount of antimatter to rebalance and align the system
 theoretically yes in reality i do not know
 when the effect hits the forcefields will align opening a clean straight path to the other dimension whatever the time distortion i must add the antimatter at the appropriate moment geordi if the professor was right i will need a twenty seven second countdown
 captain i now have the antimatter and am moving towards the opening at the end of the lab the next time distortion should occur within seconds geordi begin countdown on my mark now
 captain there appear to be three of us
 should i drop the antimatter or wait for one of you
 only one of us is at the correct time continuum
 which one
 me its me
 yes sir
 it is well patched sir closed indicates a permanent condition which i cannot guarantee
 with pleasure sir
 i see so the difficulty in attaining such complex positioning in zero gravity environment coupled with the adverse effect it would have on the psychological well being of the average human male is what makes this anecdote so amusing yes very humorous indeed hysterical in fact
 you are aware counsellor that the holodeck can be programmed to recreate an oceanic environment
 one can swim in moonlight
 commander riker i am receiving a code forty seven
 it is a code forty seven sir starfleet emergency frequency
 dytallix b is one of seven uninhabited planets mined for the federation by the dytallix mining company it is in the nearby mira system
 i have the readout on dytallix b commander
 dytallix b is the fifth of six planets circling the red giant known as mira one side always faces the sun where temperatures reach up to one hundred and eighty degrees the mines line the temperate zone between the day and night sides but they are long deserted
 i believe the answer to both questions is no sir in a manner of speaking it is nothing but a lifeless hunk of rock a useless ball of mud a worthless chunk
 the third is just coming into range now sir it is ambassador class heavy cruiser uss horatio
 three sir all gathered inside what appears to be the entrance to a mining tunnel
 at that speed sir we should arrive nine point six three hours behind the original schedule sir
 computer this is lieutenant commander data please access all starfleet command orders to starships starbases and colonies for the past six months
 startling quite extraordinary in fact
 that was not a request i was simply talking to myself a human idiosyncrasy triggered by fascination with a particular set of facts or sometimes brought about by senility or used as a means of weighing information before reaching a conclusion or as a
 please continue with record scan intriguing
 perhaps we can my orders were to search for abnormal patterns in starfleets directives i believe i have found just that
 these are various outposts and starbases where i have detected unusual activity over the past few months
 an uncustomary reshuffling of personnel usually in the command areas the new officers have had frequent contact with the highest levels of starfleet command
 the orders were given with great subtlety to use an aphorism starfleets left hand did not know what its right hand was doing
 i believe it is a clandestine attempt to control vital sectors of federation territory
 there is insufficient data to make such an assessment sir
 why not
 nothing so far sir
 captain i am now receiving a message from starfleet command
 aye sir
 lieutenant worf if the situation is under control please report to the bridge
 captain i have attempted to trace the message remmick was sending i believe it was aimed at an unexplored sector of our galaxy
 i believe it was a beacon
 yes sir a homing beacon sent from earth
 commander request permission to investigate this vehicle
 it is a piece of history the opportunity to examine such an ancient vehicle does not come around very often and as you pointed out we do have the time
 thank you sir
 minimal oxygen atmosphere an ancient solar generator still operating
 the onboard computers have ceased functioning i may be able to download this old style disk drive back to the enterprise
 not necessary
 the seal was broken and the environment has been corrupted
 this one is empty
 if that were the purpose there would be evidence of a more sophisticated monitoring system these containers were designed solely for refrigeration
 oc we have run into an unusual situation sir there are people on board frozen
 three the vehicle has suffered severe damage most of her systems have failed
 i do not believe we should leave them here sir with your permission we will be returning with three containers
 i could not leave them there captain the condition of their vehicle was deteriorating
 i see your point captain but at the time it seemed the proper thing to do
 i was able to retrieve some information from the ancient disk i removed from the modules computer her name is clare raymond age thirty five occupation homemaker must be some kind of construction work
 his name is ralph offenhouse age fifty five occupation financier
 much of his file we could not retrieved his name is l q sonny clemonds apparently his occupation had something to do with music
 by your calendar two thousand three hundred sixty four
 actually there is a distinct difference between an android and a robot
 you were in a space module
 hooey ah as in hogwash malarky jive an intentional fabrication
 actually the process of cryonics was never more than a fad and did not continue much beyond the midtwenty first century
 talk
 is there something wrong
 i believe he means television sir that particular form of entertainment did not last much beyond the year two thousand forty
 what is to be done with them sir
 commander a low mileage pit woofie
 these are the most unusual humans i have ever encountered
 since we have no contact with the romulans for fifty three years seven months eighteen days we must consider that the information we do have is out of date
 the strategy is built on a single premise the hostile intent of the romulans if the premise is sound so is the proposal
 it was a passenger liner which mostly travelled earths atlantic ocean during the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries
 you asked to see me
 a celebration
 i will speak to the captain
 inquiry you do not seem to be having as much difficulty adjusting to your current circumstances as the others
 no but the computer can replicate such an instrument
 i must leave now
 it is a buffer between the romulan empire and the federation
 i do not know
 no that would not be appropriate
 captain there is nothing left of outpost delta zero five
 sensors indicate no evidence of conventional attack
 the condition is identical captain
 negative sir
 sensors indicate all of their systems are armed sir
 that offer does present a certain fascination
 engineering this is science one i have just observed what appeared to be a random energy transference
 aft outboard of the port nacelle
 possibility sir an unexplained power fluctuation
 aye sir
 pulaski sir
 aye sir
 captain this is a life form not to allow it to develop naturally would deny us the opportunity to study it
 captain the final manifest has been received
 aye sir
 worf assemble your security team in sickbay
 yes doctor captains orders
 perhaps i could serve in that capacity
 nervous i find this very interesting although i understand in technical terms how life is formed there is still a part of the process which eludes me the child inside you are you able to access his thought process does he have thoughts you are aware of him is he aware of you and when does that awareness begin
 how does it feel
 yes
 now now doctor doctor doctor
 thank you for allowing me to participate it was remarkable
 two hours nineteen minutes sir
 data
 my name it is pronounced data
 you called me dahta
 one is my name the other is not
 it indicates a genetically engineered biological life form
 query eager beaver
 aye sir excuse me doctor
 computer run diagnostic on module l seven three
 perhaps it is a sensor malfunction computer inquiry is growth actually occurring in module l seven three
 a subspace phase inverter
 certain cyanoacrylates
 commander the child is the source of the unusual radiation
 that analysis is correct
 aye sir
 stand by to energise
 there it is again an area of blackness
 nothing sir
 sir our sensors are showing that to be an absence of everything it is a void without matter or energy of any kind
 perhaps perhaps not sir
 captain the most elementary and valuable statement in science the beginning of wisdom is i do not know i do not know what that is sir
 accessing negative sir there is no record of any federation vessel encountering anything remotely like this
 all the probes systems are functioning perfectly
 unknown sir
 still no readings of any kind sir
 whatever it is sir we seem to be inside it
 no response captain
 difficult to make a judgment sir based on the absence of information
 this void has a total lack of dimension therefore by any accepted standard it does not exist yet being within it denies that conclusion
 could a lack of dimension be another dimension in itself
 inertial guidance shows one point four parsecs travelled captain
 except that we are still in it sir captain if we dropped a stationary beacon and travelled straight away from it we would have a fixed point of reference to confirm speed and distance
 the beacon is in place captain
 the beacon is falling astern captain
 captain we are receiving a signal from dead ahead
 closing on the new signal sir
 captain it is the stationary beacon we just released
 captain sensors can locate no debris from the romulan ship
 uss enterprise to uss yamato respond please uss enterprise calling uss yamato respond please on this frequency no response captain
 life support system engineering and propulsion all appear functional but there are no life signs sir
 since we know nothing of these circumstances it is at least conceivable sir
 weve regained ships communication sir
 confirm sir navigation is possible
 i cannot make the lock sir
 captain
 add to it an attack by a nonexistent romulan vessel it does suggest an interesting question was our away team actually over there
 i have lost contact sir
 captain it is not in the same sector but another opening has appeared
 ive lost the signal sir
 captain
 captain sensors show nothing out there absolutely nothing
 nagilum
 perhaps referring to your gender doctor
 sensors still show nothing out there
 all evidence indicates it is willing and able to do what it proposes
 sir i do not believe there is anything you can do to prevent it
 i have a question sir
 what is death
 which do you believe sir
 i agree with her jeanluc
 yes it is wrong of you to force us
 captain we are clear we are out of the void
 we are out of the void sir you may stop autodestruct
 all navigational systems confirm we are at warp six on course sir
 is there a problem chief engineer la forge called for me urgent
 geordi i just had a strange conversation with your assistant although it is three days until we rendezvous with starship victory she
 most unusual
 but geordi your starfleet specialty is antimatter power dilithium regulators
 this is not a computer simulation
 geordi your message said urgent
 my watson
 ah yes that does seem only fair
 he can be reached at b baker street
 computer select at random a mystery by sir arthur conan doyle where i will play sherlock holmes and lieutenant la forge will be doctor john watson
 excellent
 holmes collected nothing neither trinkets nor thoughts which were not specifically significant to him
 the emerald tie pin presented to holmes by queen victoria after he solved the theft of the brucepartington plans a book a copy of whitakers almanac which provided holmes the key to the secret code in the valley of fear the snuff box of wilhelm gottsleig siegesmann van der romstein
 primarily as doctor watson you will keep a written record of everything i say and do for later publication and the famous holmes violin he purchased this in a pawn shop in tottenham court road for fifty five shillings which he considered to be a very good investment
 merely throwing myself into the part watson
 watson we are about to have guests
 be a good fellow and answer that lets not keep the inspector waiting
 lestrade of course
 then may i say your perturbation becomes you inspector lestrade whilst simultaneously affording me yet again the opportunity to serve queen and country
 absolutely
 watson pray continue inspector
 i believe you will find inspector that this emissary here works not for but against the king of bohemia and that photograph of the king and his mistress is to be used as blackmail further upon deeper reflection you will deduce as did i that
 geordi where are you going geordi
 hurrying after him but but geordi i was just about to reveal that the sir is in fact a madam
 to solve a sherlock holmes mystery
 then i should have extended the sequence of events
 is that not exactly what we were doing
 am i so different from you doctor are you able to cease thinking on command
 are you suggesting that there is some value in losing
 i have read them all
 i accept your challenge doctor
 we will return to the holodeck where i will dare it to defeat me and you madam are invited to be a witness
 come watson
 there i have instructed the computer to give us a sherlock holmestype problem but not one written specifically by sir arthur conan doyle
 exactly will that be sufficient doctor
 this is no larger than the holodeck of course so the computer adjusts by placing images of more distant perspectives on the holodeck walls
 no it is a ruse this way
 the running youth was a ploy the real crime is here and the intended victim is that man mister jabez wilson employee of the red headed league dupe of a gang of criminals
 i saw the plaque the home of the red headed league and this rope dangling from the bell which enabled me to deduce that mister jabez wilson was headed here to meet a most distasteful and untimely demise from this
 reasoning from the general to the specific is that not the very definition of deduction is that not the way sherlock holmes worked
 for whatever finds us my dear watson
 she has been abducted
 the good doctor
 watson the doctor has been carried off by two men one is tall the other is shorter left handed and is employed in a laboratory
 one set of footfalls are widely spaced the other is evenly spaced closer together further on the ground you can see the swirling scrapes made by his left shoe as he twists behind presumably to see if he is being followed left footed means left handed the dark colouring of the scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber a type of nonconductive soles used by researchers experimenting with electricity finally there can be no argument the game is afoot come watson
 hear that what do those footfalls tell you watson
 more particularly that our opposition does indeed consist of two men and that one of them is carrying the bound and gagged doctor pulaski
 not at all because we do not hear the doctors footfalls we must assume that she is being carried and since we do not hear her cries for help we know that she is gagged further both sets of footfalls are heavy and masculine one man seems to shuffle and stumble in an irregular pattern since the ground is level we must conclude that doctor pulaski is struggling against one of her captor sporadically knocking him off stride deduction pure and simple well not that simple
 there they are again watson i dare say we have caught up rather nicely with our quarry
 there should be a doorway
 there is nothing here of relevance i do not see how this connects with the disappearance of the doctor
 doctor kate pulaski but do not concern yourself inspector you have enough on your mind
 no look at his shoes hes more a convict released today from dartmoor prison 
 and when you check i believe you will find that this poor soul is the victims commonlaw wife who has been dreading the release of this a vile and abusive man
 not with her hands no but with this a beaded shawl when used as a garrote these beads will leave marks quite similar to fingerprints and my dear watson you will note from the victims throat the marks are too evenly spaced to be have been made by human hands
 not really inspector and now for strictly personal reasons i must leave come watson this murder does not connect with our case
 yes
 i do not know and that is what puzzles me
 no
 we will find doctor pulaski in here
 it is the only obvious choice
 not any more he wants us to find him
 the master criminal the man holmes could only defeat at the cost of his own life at reichenbach falls our adversary my dear watson is none other than professor moriarty himself
 and a trail which is so well marked that obviously we are meant to follow it
 no watson not a dead end at all hello whats this can you see the scratches
 professor moriarty i presume
 he is the one worthy opponent created by the author conan doyle
 where is doctor pulaski
 she would not have told you anything
 have you injured her
 say nothing
 computer exit
 computer execute complete shutdown of the holodeck
 explain
 we must see the captain
 this
 he does moriarty
 nor do i
 no she is in grave danger
 captain this character moriarty he called for the arch
 and perhaps our library files as well sir that level of information would be necessary in order to create a true adversary for me
 he is still a fictional character sir originally programmed with nineteenth century knowledge
 only time sir
 captain i believe that would place the doctor at risk it is probable our mortality failsafe has been overridden
 there can be only one explanation in programming moriarty to defeat me not holmes he had to be able to acquire something which i possess
 consciousness sir without it he could not defeat me
 i will change into my uniform sir
 captain
 captain this holographic image differs from any i have ever seen could he have actually injured you
 we will find moriarty this way sir the warehouse
 congratulations professor i capitulate to the better man your victory sir is well earned
 sensor readings show it to be a small classnine vessel probably an interplanetary cargo ship
 i have its call sign now sir
 its cargo holds are empty the readout shows its guidance system is malfunctioning the pilot is attempting to hold course manually
 rogue ah cad knave rake rascal villain wild element
 sexual attraction in this context is not a part of my programming i am an android
 ah of course it is
 no
 no
 from alcohol that is not possible for me sir
 the act or the emotion
 i believe that statement to be inaccurate sir
 i doubt that statement is entirely accurate either sir
 i do not understand
 of course i do it is a witticism a gag a bon mot a fluctuation of words concluding with a trick ending
 right over there sir why
 so you agree with okona that i am missing a very important human factor
 i am capable of that function when it is expected of me
 of course i do it is a witticism a gag a bon mot a fluctuation of
 but why
 have i said something to offend you
 then why are you annoyed
 humanoid
 you told a joke
 i am not laughing
 perhaps the joke was not funny
 are you sure
 i agree what do i do
 computer i wish to know more about humour why certain combinations of words and actions make humans laugh

 no too esoteric more generic
 that one rw nine six three two one twentieth century
 mister comic i wish to know what is funny
 tip oneill accessing twentieth century male politician overweight wearing female clothing carrying a valise that looks like a fish so the juxtaposition of gender and an amphibian briefcase is funny
 nothing makes me laugh i wish to learn comic how much time do we have here
 unlimited
 tough room a colloquialism meaning a severe rigid closedminded audience i understand i will attempt to be an easy room show me what is funny
 i am an android
 that is considered to be funny
 ah a word that ends in k so if you put funny teeth in your mouth and jump around like an idiot that is considered funny
 data
 that does not apply i simply want to know what is funny i want to be able to involve myself in other peoples laughter i wish to join in

 a guy walks into the doctors office the doctor tells him you need an operation the guy says i want a second opinion the doctor said okay youre ugly too baboom boom was that funny
 my timing is digital guinan giggles what
 why
 with cigar and silly voice a monk a clone and a ferengi decide to go bowling together
 i will be back
 sensors show it to be an interplanetary vessel sir class seven crew complement twenty six
 it is slowing and is holding its position captain
 similar in specifications and capabilities but a variation in markings and hailing language
 sensors indicate it a security vessel from the planet straleb
 a klingon fly half the size of an earth mosquito with no sting and a buzzing sound like this

 i told a joke
 no one laughed
 she said i spoiled the joke

 good evening ladies and germs laughter  mimes a golf swing with his cigar  laughter i come from a town so small we had a fraction for a zip code laughter
 it was so small in fact we didnt have a godfather of crime we had a nephew laughter
 it was a holodeck audience they were programmed to laugh at everything perhaps i should reprogram the audience to display a more accurate response
 no but there is nothing more uniquely human
 goodbye data
 was that funny accessing ah burns and allen roxy theater new york city  it still works then there was the one about the girl in the nudist colony that nothing looked good on
 take my worf please
 come in
 geordi is counsellor troi with you
 indeed or stated more correctly i wanted you to see me
 please
 it is a beard geordi a fine full dignified beard one which commands respect and projects thoughtfulness and dignity well opinions
 when i stroke the beard thusly do i not appear more intellectual
 why was she laughing
 data to enterprise
 we are inside graves home
 all is quiet so far of course no one knew we were coming
 understood sir i suggest we look around to see if anybody is home
 lieutenant commander data
 quite correct sir did you know doctor soong
 i have noticed doctor
 i have noticed grandpa that you keep repeating the same notes of a musical phrase i am unfamiliar with
 what happens to this man
 a happy ending the mechanical man gets his wish
 but pain is unpleasant is it not
 desire to long for to crave a wish a request a
 no i do not suppose i will ever really know
 funny i have had great difficulty determining what funny is
 you mentioned your impending death grandpa may i say you face it with remarkable courage and stoicism
 you condone homicide sir
 really grandpa
 but the doctor
 that is not necessarily true grandpa i do have an off button if you will its activation robs me of my consciousness therefore rendering me dead for all intents and purposes it is not something i enjoy contemplating
 that will not be necessary doctor he is gone
 it happened just a few moments ago in my arms ira graves is dead
 to do so would have been pointless all things must pass may i go now sir
 we will try to honour him in the manner in which he specified will we not sir
 i am glad sir it was his dying wish
 you always did love the sky a stargazer that is what you are
 ira never told you how beautiful you were to him he never told you that did he he could not tell you do you understand
 he wanted to every waking moment and he wanted you to know that you were everything to him
 i believe i have a few words to say sir steps up to the case just look at that face the face of a thinker a warrior a man for all seasons yes ira graves was all that and more but he was not perfect perhaps his greatest fault was that he was too selfless he cared too much for his fellow man with nary a thought for himself a man of limitless accomplishments and unbridled modesty i can safely say that to know him was to love him and to love him was to know him those who knew him loved him while those who did not know him loved him from afar
 im almost finished sir
 i am sorry sir perhaps it was my admiration for grandpa that got the best of me
 that is the way i think of him sir my only living relative no longer living
 i was only trying to carry out his wishes i just wanted to keep my promise to him
 yes sir i will work on staying within myself
 thank you sir
 verbal composition at its most sophisticated level your childlike mind cannot appreciate the timeworn wisdom of my words
 when you get to be my age you will understand
 you are only as old as you feel try to remember that boy
 i am many things scholar artist philosopher lover genius
 yes im aware of your interest in her
 nothing sir nothing at all
 i detest hypocrisy i wish they would just come out and admit it
 that your interest in kareen is not purely professional try as you will you cannot win her heart she does not care for older men or men of limited intellect looking at riker
 i understand i understand all too well removing the competition will not help you picard
 if you wish to apologise i am prepared to listen
 you were a bit rude to me might make you feel better if you said you were sorry
 that is ridiculous i am as healthy as a rigelian ox
 sickbay are you ill captain
 i am sure that will not be necessary captain i am fully capable of running a circuit check on myself it will immediately determine any abnormalities
 just as i expected i am fine could not be better
 why should i this concerns me more than it does any of you
 it was a waste of time then and it is a waste of time now
 hello kareen dont you think its time we stopped pretending you know who i am
 you do know who i am
 it is me i am here i am alive
 i deactivated data and transferred my mind into his frame i never imagined how much of my self i would retain my feelings my dreams
 how can they it is my body now it is out of their hands
 something wonderful has happened i can take a deep breath now without feeling stabbing pain i will never have to face death again think of the things i will accomplish over the next thousand years what oh i know what youre thinking there is no need to worry i will create an android body for you too we can witness the end of time together why are you crying kareen i can love you now the way i always wanted to it was not right before i was too old for you too weak now i can be everything you want me to be
 thank you
 the factions on solais five are historical enemies so many have died that both societies are on the verge of extinction
 the factions have been at war for fifteen centuries
 i do not know what you mean
 unknown sir
 aye sir
 i have eliminated all but five distinct forms of signing i will learn them all computer show me gestural language designation m nine
 the use of gestures and hand signals pre dates the spoken word in most cultures the major exception being the leyrons of malkus nine who actually developed a written language first computer continue presentation increase increase increase increase
 captain i have reviewed and stored five distinct signing languages here is an example of the first this is blue this is a blue ocean this is a blue ocean at sunset this is two people walking along the beach by a blue ocean at sunset this is two happy people in love walking along the beach by a blue ocean at sunset this is two people
 it was my fault i am responsible for their deaths in my arrogance i thought no one could possibly harm the great riva i am such a fool
 they were more than my interpreters they were also my friends they were a part of me i did not realise how much a part until now
 i cannot i will not
 someone else will have to speak with them not me not after what i allowed to happen how could i
 when data speaks for me can you hear my anguish my despair data is a fine machine but he cannot take the place of my chorus it took years to develop a communication that cannot be easily replaced
 i cannot help them captain please take me back to ramatis
 you would be better off without my help
 you want to know if i had some special technique
 there is no trick i had no magic
 yes my chorus was special they allowed me to combine different perceptions
 not really my technique was to look for some thing no matter how small that was common to both groups and then to begin a process where one person or one group expresses themselves to each other
 yes but what is even more difficult is to get each side to listen really listen to each other and to understand
 you are very good with people
 the real secret is turning disadvantage to advantage
 that is an interesting it would give them something in common to troi i do not understand counsellor to what is he referring
 thank you thank me ah
 translating riva put the table over there
 light the torches to let them know that i am back
 you may leave whenever you choose i will send out a message when i am ready to go
 yes it is turning a disadvantage into an advantage learning sign will be a part of their process of learning how to live together in peace
 and that is the first and most important aspect of any relationship counsellor it took me only moments to learn sign language it will take them months
 these people have been fighting all of their lives they know only hatred suspicion and fear even with my chorus i could not have changed their attitudes in a day we have a chance they want the talks to be successful
 thank you for your concern i will be fine to troi and thank you for everything
 captain we are picking up a faint distress signal on an open subspace frequency it appears to be coming from an adjacent sector
 aye sir a voice only transmission from the uss lantree a federation supply ship
 we are still receiving their signal captain but there is no message
 two point two milliparsecs bearing three zero at one four five degrees
 the lantree is a class six federation supply ship assigned to gamma seven sector captain li telaka commanding normal complement twenty six officers and crew
 class three defensive only
 aye sir
 no life signs captain
 all systems seem functional captain everything is in perfect order
 i have verified receipt of the access codes for the lantree captain
 the lantree computer reports access codes received and accepted sir
 we have override control of her bridge captain all systems answering
 you sent for me doctor
 certainly i took advanced training in the operation of auxiliary space vessels at starfleet academy where i received
 youre certain the captain approved this doctor
 begin shuttlecraft launch sequence
 we are in position doctor
 and if they are not
 that is by no means certain doctor but i was referring to you
 ready to transport
 you have the coordinates chief obrien
 standing by
 how could you doctor he has not said anything
 all systems are functioning within normal specifications doctor
 bedside manner
 doctor
 holding
 what is your condition doctor
 shall i set course for darwin station
 the evidence is fairly conclusive
 the lantree logs indicated that only one crewman had any illness prior to arrival here the first officer had a mild case of thelusian flu
 on a molecular genetic level
 the answer i believe doctor the lantree was not the source of the disease but it was the trigger
 the lantrees first officer exposed your children to thelusian flu for the first time their active immune systems set out to attack the virus and once it was triggered it kept going the antibody created an unexpected sideeffect it alters the genetic makeup of normal humans this is a comparison of the normal and altered dna these are the two molecules that have been transposed
 is irreversible
 i am sorry i could not be more helpful doctor pulaski
 doctor
 enterprise commander data ready to beam aboard
 thank you sir
 it is not reversible sir the subtle molecular transposition of
 as normal as ever sir
 interesting however theoretically
 yes sir
 no sir her records were shipped by way of starfleet headquarters they have not caught up with us yet
 hair brush
 it has a follicle sir live cells
 doctor
 there she is captain
 we are approaching starbase one seven nine
 starbase one seven nine we are ready to commence transfer
 aye sir
 thank you sir
 viewscreen on focus on area magnification factor ten increase magnification to fifty
 the substance appears to be a rare form of subatomic bacteria capable of doubling itself in size every fifteen minutes it seems to be reacting with two of the compounds present in the enterprise structure
 how did you come to that decision
 aye sir
 according to the rate of reproduction there should be a twelve centimetre opening in the klingon hull at this time
 it will take some time to locate them sir they are on undesignated manoeuvres in the pheben system
 slow to impulse
 the pagh is either cloaked or destroyed sir
 considering the absence of debris captain it is reasonable to assume the klingon vessel is in the area and cloaked
 and since we do not know its intent i recommend we go to red alert
 hes only dazed sir
 it has all armament locked on us and ready to fire
 that would seem to be superstition
 this game is exceedingly simple with only fifty two cards twenty one of which i will see and four other players there are a limited number of winning combinations
 of course the bets will indicate of the relative strength of each hand
 i too
 i bet ten
 i bet five
 i bet ten
 is that what is known as a poker face
 i fold
 you had nothing
 it makes very little sense to bet when you cannot win
 how could you tell
 my condition does not alter with the passage of time commander
 and was the sole member of the committee to oppose my entrance on the grounds that i was not a sentient being
 it sounds intriguing
 youve constructed a positronic brain
 have you determined how the electron resistance across the neural filaments is to be resolved
 that would seem to be a necessary first step
 but if the answer is not forthcoming your model will not function
 captain i believe his basic research lacks the specifics necessary to support an experiment of this magnitude
 you sent for me sir
 i find myself in complete agreement with that assessment of the situation sir
 i will not submit to the procedure sir
 sir lieutenant la forges eyes are far superior to human biological eyes true then why are not all human officers required to have their eyes replaced with cybernetic implants picard looks away i see it is precisely because i am not human
 is it not customary to request permission before entering an individuals quarters
 reduced to the mere facts of the events the substance the flavour of the moment could be lost take games of chance
 yes i had read and absorbed every treatise and textbook on the subject and felt myself well prepared for the experience yet when i finally played poker i discovered that the reality bore little resemblance to the rules
 that while i believe it is possible to download the information contained in the positronic brain i do not think you have acquired the expertise necessary to preserve the essence of those experiences there is an ineffable quality to memory which i do not believe can survive your procedure
 no sir i am not under your nor anyone elses command i have resigned from starfleet
 i regret the decision but i must i am the culmination of one mans dream this is not ego or vanity but when doctor soong created me he added to the substance of the universe if by your experiments i am destroyed something unique something wonderful will be lost i cannot permit that i must protect his dream
 with the application of a little care wes the paper can be utilised again
 the dream of the fire by kratak thank you worf
 is something wrong
 no one regrets that necessity more than myself you do understand my reasons
 as doctor pulaski would at this juncture no doubt remind us life is rarely fair
 i shall miss you geordi
 i see from limitless options i am reduced to none or rather one i can only hope that commander maddox is more capable than it would appear
 captain i have complete confidence in your ability to represent my interests
 an android
 websters twenty fourth century dictionary fifth edition defines an android as an automaton made to resemble a human being
 sir
 doctor noonien soong
 the foremost authority in cybernetics
 human
 i have an ultimate storage capacity of eight hundred quadrillion bits my total linear computational speed has been rated at sixty trillion operations per second
 my medals
 i do not know sir i suppose none i just wanted them is that vanity
 a gift from you sir
 yes sir
 it is a reminder of friendship and service
 i would prefer not to answer that question sir i gave my word
 she was special to me sir we were intimate
 i am taking part in a legal hearing to determine my rights and status am i a person or property
 my right to choose perhaps my very life
 i formally refuse to undergo your procedure
 thank you and commander continue your work when you are ready i will still be here i find some of what you propose intriguing
 sir there is a celebration on the holodeck
 because you failed in your task
 yes sir
 is it not true that had you refused to prosecute captain louvois would have ruled summarily against me
 that action injured you and saved me i will not forget it
 not yet sir but with your help i am learning
 sir we are approaching klavdia three
 sir the planets troposphere is distorting our signal
 aye sir
 you wanted to see me
 salia of daled four
 little is known she was born on daled four her parents were from opposite sides in a civil war which has lasted for centuries they both died shortly after her birth a federation ship brought her and her governess to klavdia three so that she could be raised in a neutral environment
 it is hoped she will unite the factions and bring peace
 what puzzles me captain is how she is expected to bring peace to daled four its inhabitants have been fighting throughout their recorded history
 only that it is the difference between night and day
 did i what i meant sir is that daled four rotates only once per revolution therefore one side is constantly dark and the other side constantly light one might surmise that the two hemispheres have developed disparate cultures which is a major cause of most wars
 it should be that simple wesley judging by her appearance it is likely you and salia are biologically compatible of course there could be a difference in the histocompatibility complex in the cell membrane but
 the troposphere appears to be distorting our signals it is fascinating captain klavdia three and daled four have almost identical atmospheres
 sir sensors indicate the communication originated from a terawatt source on the planet
 it is what is needed to penetrate the atmosphere
 the yamato log should be in our computer by rendezvous sir
 sir
 no sir it might be due to problems currently being experienced by the yamato
 sensors indicate no life readings sir
 unknown sir
 no sir none
 aye sir we have a visual record
 no sir it appears to be a scanner possibly a transmitter
 unknown sir
 in orbit around a planet at coordinates two two seven mark three five nine sir
 twelve hours sixteen minutes sir
 scanning sir
 no lifeform readings sir
 approximately two hundred thousand years sir
 its size and composition match the probe which scanned the yamato sir
 consider captain this programme has entered an alien data base ours and in less than seven hours has managed to not only learn our systems but has begun to reprogram our computer
 we downloaded the yamato log and contained in the log was the programme
 doctor pulaski is unwilling to trust the turbolifts she is sending medical teams through the access tunnels
 try a bypass on the shield control interface
 yes
 any answer would be mere speculation this is yet another example of how our actions have random results
 scanners show no other life forms on the planet sir
 aye sir
 yes sir there are also similarities to dewan and iccobar
 it is sir
 accessing sir
 captain your original hypothesis is correct iconian is the parent tongue of a language family which consists of iccobar dewan and dinasian i have constructed a basic working understanding through a comparison of common root words such as mother father child home tribe food life death yours ours mine
 you do understand sir that my interpretation of the symbols will not be exact
 this would appear to be manual override
 that was not manual override
 but we have established that this is not a holograph if i step through and investigate we could determine whether it is truly a gateway
 no i disagree captain there is nothing in this room to indicate it was used as a military command centre perhaps a transporter room
 captain there is a vast underground power source which is controlled by this console i believe my triggering of the gateway has caused a dramatic upsurge in power level ah i have access
 captain
 no i am damaged
 the iconian programme is attempting to rewrite my software physical manifestations blindness motor con
 i understand sir
 the power source sir
 the probes sir
 the doors sir
 yes sir
 correct sir
 help
 describe please
 right one metre
 correct key blue amber amber red
 blue blue blue
 i am accessing
 captain captain
 i am on the enterprise how did i get here
 iconia i was on iconia now i am on the enterprise
 query what have i forgotten
 may i help
 yes captain
 commander your transmission has been received
 and acknowledged
 aye sir
 analysis bears out that the object was definitely terrestrial in origin dated mid twenty first century
 nevertheless that is what our tests indicate and the markings we discovered are consistent with this hypothesis
 that is even more significant than the object itself counsellor on several of its surfaces the molecules seem to have disintegrated
 almost as if they were hit by a weapon from our time
 those ammonia storms are less than a kilometre away yet they do not appear to penetrate this breathable zone
 the structure must be here yet we cannot see it
 sir without communication we should beam up immediately
 commander
 none of these people are emitting life signs
 not illusion lieutenant they do exist but they do not register as either man or machine
 take this creature for example he does not exhibit any dna structure
 what sort of business do you suppose he is getting down to
 yes sir
 ah is this poker
 blackjack accessing ah also known as twenty one a number which defines the object of the game picture cards are worth ten aces one or eleven all other cards face value
 hit me another please
 if the objective of the game is to approach a total of twenty one points i will definitely need another card
 hit me
 the number of the cards and their values remain quite constant what would be the purpose in counting them
 fun sir while there is a certain amount of enjoyment involved i am mainly conducting research into
 understood sir
 thank you sir
 sorry sir
 excuse me excuse me aside from the main door is there another exit i might use
 excuse me
 sir i can find no other exits i believe we are trapped here
 sir our options appear quite limited
 commander i am picking up something most unusual in another section of this structure it appears to be human dna
 thirty one point nine metres above and to the right of us
 the reading i received is from behind this door sir
 my reading is intensifying sir
 none sir
 definitely human male
 he has been dead for two hundred and eighty three years sir the lack of any advanced decomposition is due to the sterile environment
 is this significant sir
 fifty two stars sir places it between  and  ad it correlates with the debris we found colonel s richey rest in peace colonel
 captain this is the story of a group of compulsive gamblers caught up in a web of crime corruption and deceit
 it is told by nefarious lothario mickey d who appears only at the climax to carry out the coldblooded murder of the hotel bellboy
 there is also a subplot about an older man conspiring with a younger woman to murder her husband she is squandering her inheritance
 our projected survival would be approximately twelve seconds
 i believe she is asking if we want the room cleaned
 i suggest we separate and blend in with these beings casual queries offered inconspicuously may prove fruitful
 excuse me sir might i inquire where are you from
 and how did you get here
 where is your automobile now
 could you take me there
 i believe you are trapped inside the royale just as i am
 the odds favour standing pat
 it is all a question of probabilities quite simple really if one bets with any sequential consistency
 the combinations totalling seven or eleven have considerable value when achieved on the primary attempt with eight variations possible to create those totals the likelihood of those totals occurring is not significant however
 i believe so sir
 single digits on each cube are not at all desirable
 actually six is a valid point of course now the objective is to roll a duplicate six before hitting seven
 there is a certain degree of random fortune involved i believe that is why they call it gambling
 commander these cubes are improperly balanced i believe their final resting position would be
 i believe so i will make another attempt
 baby needs a new pair of shoes
 yes sir twelve point three million perhaps i will bet seven hundred thousand
 but sir the sale price of this edifice is twelve point five million
 sir
 i do not believe that is a prudent choice sir
 i tried to caution you sir
 i wish to cash in sir
 this is not an efficient method for the preparation of sustenance
 estimate intercept in three minutes
 target vehicle we will be within tractor beam range in two seconds
 shuttlebay two prepare for retrieval procedure
 locking tractor beam
 engage secondary tractor beam
 yes sir
 captain both primary and reserve power has been drained from the shuttle i am going to have to connect to the enterprise in order to activate the shuttles systems
 the polarity is not compatible
 the power requirements of the shuttle do not match those of the enterprise we will need a variable phase inverter to align the power from the enterprise to the circuits of the shuttle
 i do not have enough information
 perhaps you had better step out of the way
 increase the power
 adjust the invert two percent positive
 yes
 adjust the invert two percent negative
 according to the shuttle log the enterprise was destroyed three hours nineteen minutes from now
 i have nothing to offer there is not enough information upon which to base a hypothesis
 it is similar to our tractor beam sir only much more powerful
 the beam is coming from the centre of the vortex sensors show it to be only a mass of energy
 course set sir
 we are back on course to endicor
 i would consider them insignificant
 even if the molecular level controls have failed we can still recrystallise the dilithium without outside help
 perhaps we can reprogram the system to correct the readout variables
 and it has nothing to do with commander rikers new assignment
 there is of course a genetic predisposition toward hostility among all klingons but worf has been unusually out of sorts
 empirical study monitor the subject
 within the norm of klingon patterns of course discretion will be required
 and you must solve it
 but he needs his study time
 in solitude there is nothing to trigger unusual behaviour
 but that would defeat the opportunity for our behavioural research in all probability he is simply lonely we can relieve his anxiety through socialisation
 excuse me lieutenant you seem to have lost the will to communicate with others you have friends here we we care about you why just recently geordi wesley and i were saying
 he seems quite sincere in his desire for solitude
 the ships computer would have corrected immediately
 and what is the significance of the anniversary of this event
 we can programme the ships computer to supply simulations on the holodeck
 we need only to programme the computer with details of the specific ceremony
 that would entail the use of klingon painstiks
 enduring physical suffering is considered a klingon spiritual test
 we are his family
 there is nothing to find
 if i were not a consummate professional and an android i would find this entire procedure insulting
 computer is this it
 computer please give us klingon personnel appropriate to this event
 these images are specifically programmed for ascension rites
 shall we begin
 the true test of klingon strength is to admit ones most profound feelings while under extreme duress
 commander ive been reviewing the unmanned probe scans at some point during the last one hundred and fifty years the fifth planet of selcundi drema has shattered forming an asteroid belt
 no it is a personal project i have reset the sensors to scan for frequencies outside their usual range
 the dips and peaks of the galaxys magnetic field organic molecules in nebular clouds energetic cosmic rays
 of course
 those signals are very faint and difficult to distinguish from background noise that is why i am boosting the power
 i will be removing that equipment to my quarters
 computer identify please
 is there a pattern
 naturally occurring
 key universal translator please
 lock on comm link and boost
 read please
 enhance please
 yes
 computer please access all volcanic and tectonic plate activity in drema four
 computer locate captain picard
 an excellent steed sir sorry to disturb you captain
 yes sir it is important very eight weeks ago i received a transmission a simple four word message is anybody out there i answered it
 yes sir i am glad that you understand sir
 no sir we speak often it is a young female humanoid
 no sir
 i have kept that somewhat vague sir but sarjenka that is her name has been quite specific telling me details of her family and friends and interspersed among these confidences have been some alarming references
 drema four has been enduring the same geological stresses we have found in the other systems
 yes sir
 if we can determine the cause of these geological disturbances we might be able to reverse the process
 i was hoping that you might have another option sir
 yes sir
 yes sir i understand sir
 commander riker report to the captains quarters
 but commander the dremans are not a subject for philosophical debate they are a people
 yes sarjenkas transmission could be viewed as a call for help
 she knows me
 we are going to allow her to die are we not
 sarjenka this is data respond please
 reason for failure
 captain
 captain permission to beam down to drema four
 i have been unable to contact sarjenka
 sir i feel it is important to determine the reason for
 captain your orders were to deliver the message correct
 then what is the difference between sending the message and delivering it personally
 sir we have come this far
 yes sir
 sir
 i will signal for immediate beam out
 sarjenka wait im data
 it would take too long to explain you and your family must leave
 then why are you here
 i am sorry for that but it is very complicated does your family know where you are
 you cannot survive in this
 enterprise two to beam up you must come with me
 where is commander riker
 to the bridge
 quite impossible
 i do sir she was frightened and did not wish to be left alone
 captain i will see to it that she is not in the way
 counsellor allow me please sarjenka no one will harm you these are my friends
 i will require my hand thank you
 sensors locked on probes
 resonators activated harmonic sequences have begun
 we are attempting to quiet your planet if we succeed there will be no more quakes no more volcanoes
 captain sensors indicate a planetwide reduction in tectonic stress levels
 your parents will be safe now
 look sarjenka there is your home
 aye sir
 yes
 i am certain that you could
 i am afraid that is not possible
 doctor pulaski this is sarjenka
 it does not sing for me
 because i am a machine
 but are we doing a good thing now doctor
 by robbing her of her memories
 enterprise one to beam up
 i came to apologise sir
 i appreciate your seeking other options sir your decision could have been unilateral
 yes sir she will not remember me sir but i will remember her
 yes sir
 sensors indicate no shuttle or other ships in this sector
 search pattern has been input sir
 we have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a vessel without warp drive could traverse in the time allotted
 according to these coordinates we have travelled seven thousand light years
 and are located near the system j two five
 at maximum warp in two years seven months three days eighteen hours we would reach starbase one eight five
 there is a system of roads on this planet which indicates a highly industrialised civilisation but where there should be cities there are only great rips in the surface
 it is identical to what happened to the outposts along the neutral zone
 the ship is strangely generalised in design there is no specific bridge no command centre there is no engineering section i can identify no living quarters
 there is no indication of life
 then the initial encounter was solely for the purpose of gathering information
 shields will be down in eighteen seconds
 shields are down sir
 tractor beam is released sir force field is maintaining our hull integrity
 perhaps because this ship was scanned for individual life signs apparently when they are in these slots they become part of the whole and no longer read as separate life forms
 captain i would theorise that the borg are somehow interconnected through these slots and are working collectively
 commander i believe each slot is designed for a specific borg here is where the connection is made
 the technology required to achieve this biological and artificial interface is far beyond our capabilities there are many advantages
 fascinating
 commander
 the ship appears to be regenerating perhaps this explains why they have not taken notice of our presence their collective effort is being directed into repairing this vessel
 captain the borg are in pursuit
 captain the target was not the ship the weapon was designed to drain the shields
 without our shields at this range there is a high degree of probability that a photon detonation could destroy the enterprise
 do not be apprehensive wes i found the academy examinations quite elementary
 commander riker is correct while the information imparted to cadets at the academy is unquestionably vital for prospective starfleet officers it nevertheless requires a significant period of supplementary systems training and situational disciplines
 yes sir but not quite as perspicuously
 the enterprise is at impulse speed you are cleared for take off
 so he said
 sir rhomboid dronegar sector would put us at considerable distance from captain picard
 entering rhomboid dronegar sector zero zero six
 basic early design capable of sublight travel only
 sensors indicate engineering problems theyre experiencing total guidance system failure with less than twenty four hours reserve power
 they are a relatively benign species
 they may merely have poorly developed language skills
 scanners shows limited armaments
 how they ever mastered the rudiments of space travel is a genuine curiosity
 our betazoid counsellor is often aware of things beyond our perceptive abilities
 apparently their ship is apparently quite fragile
 the pakled ship has a shield up sir
 it appears to be beyond their technology similar to romulan shields
 running frequency search negative sir
 apparently so
 sensors at maximum
 i am programming the comm system to scan the interference patterns but a full analysis will take time
 intensified scan shows their guidance system to be perfectly intact as is their power generator
 apparently the putative malfunctions were carefully programmed into their ships computer
 they seem to have made some technological leaps forward commander
 they are initiating visual contact sir
 our options have not changed we can either respond to the pakled demand or not we can either use force or not
 theres limited information available on pakled culture but the eclectic range of their equipment suggests their technology was borrowed from others
 so it would seem
 to what effect sir we are faced with an impossible conundrum
 but they lack the ability to use it properly
 goodbye geordi i shall miss you at weapons systems analysis
 as well as our hydrogen collectors fond farewell
 ongoing scanning indicates progressive weapons potential the timing will be crucial geordi must correctly interpret our intentions
 the pakleds did hear our little fiction about geordis weapons knowledge
 positive indication of armed photon torpedoes commander
 forced spectrum communications are spotty at best sir
 shields are down
 medical emergency doctor pulaski to the bridge
 he just collapsed sir
 captain i have been considering the problem of the missing ship although there is no record of a launch to the ficus sector which would not be unusual considering the chaos of the early twenty second century someone had to load that ship
 yes sir
 mariposa the spanish word for butterfly
 i thought it might be significant sir
 no sir
 over picard spinning wheels accessing a device for spinning yarn or thread that consists of a large foot or hand driven wheel and one spindle
 spindle a thin rounded tapering rod
 perhaps they were planning for the worst sir
 in the early twentysecond century earth was recovering from world war three a major philosopher of the period was liam dieghan founder of the neotranscendentalists who advocated a return to a simpler life in which one lived in harmony with nature and learned under her gentle tutelage
 i have insufficient information from which to form a cogent theory sir
 aye sir the systems sun has entered a period of severe flare activity
 class m readings from the fifth planet in the system
 sensors indicate human life form readings thirty metres below the planets surface
 there is no evidence of an advanced communication network
 the stellar flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency computer projections indicate they will brush the planet in three point six hours
 no doubt a descendant of captain walter granger
 judging a being by its physical appearance is the last major human prejudice wesley
 captain we are receiving starfleet orders granting a lwaxana
 full ambassadorial status sir
 and yours as well commander she is listed as representing the betazed government at the conference
 i would have thought a telepath would be more discreet sir
 to which dinner was the captain referring sir
 yes captain
 the use of the chime is unique but not at all dissimilar to the
 ooolans of marejaretus six who use two large stones which are continuously struck during the meal those at the dinner must eat until the stones are broken
 or the oligarchy on atifs four which require a young
 indeed sir im on my way data out
 so by using the square root of pi and multiplying it by nine to the third power i was able to accurately calculate the distance between the omicron system and the crab nebula
 yes captain that is a particularly spellbinding subject in most stars the rare earth element europium is enriched relative to samarium and gadolinium
 it is however
 and at this point the second coorbital satellite avoids a collision with the first
 captain perhaps i should remain and further entertain our guest
 indeed captain i know many more interesting anecdotes sir for example
 sir
 yes sir
 commander are you planning on going into the holodeck
 could you postpone our departure for just five minutes sir
 carlos
 she is correct sir i am detecting large amounts of ultritium
 i believe the wiser course of action here is to bend
 that is correct fold to bend to make compact or to capitulate
 i do not believe lieutenant worf understands all the nuances of this betting procedure
 the cards have been favouring the lieutenant but that is the result of random chance therefore a temporary condition
 shuffles geordi
 the game is seven card stud after the queen oneeyed jacks and low card in the hole are wild
 emergency signal reads as follows enterprise to divert to coordinates fourtwothree by one one two by five one immediately further orders forthcoming
 the message does not elaborate
 our destination is a point near the boradis system
 the first federation outpost was established thirty four years ago on boradis three
 yet we are not headed for a specific colony the coordinates given are outside the boradis system
 none sir
 we are receiving sir
 apparently there were no starships available on starbase one five three the envoy is aboard a class eight probe
 by sending the probe to meet us rather than diverting the enterprise they are saving us six point one hours
 we are on a course precisely parallel to the probe sir
 as far as i can determine sir very little there are four colonies in the boradis system as well as nine other outposts scattered throughout the sector
 there are thirteen colonies with minimal defences in that sector
 based on the last assumed position of the klingon vessel its apparent trajectory and our estimates of their cruising speed we should be in scanner range in fifteen hours eight minutes
 android of course is correct but i fail to see how chaperon is applicable in this situation
 at the moment i would find it difficult to choose
 captain we are detecting a ship
 bearing three onesix mark four two
 extreme sensor range
 sensors show life forms aboard but i am unable to ascertain whether they are awake or dormant however the vessels propulsion systems are inactive so i would hypothesize that the crew is asleep
 however i could be in error
 the tong has changed course to three two mark eight one increasing to warp three
 the tong is now on a heading of four two mark one one three they are accelerating to warp five
 they are slowing to impulse sir
 in the game of military brinksmanship individual physical prowess is less important than the perception of a species as a whole for over nine millennia potential foes have regarded the zakdorns as having the greatest innately strategic minds in the galaxy
 exactly
 the zakdornian culture is replete with selfassuredness and confidence seldom is it undeserved for example kolrami is a third level grand master at the game of strategema
 forever curious this urge to compete
 doctor there are other ways to challenge oneself
 to avoid deceiving oneself
 why doctor
 to what end
 aye sir
 but i expressed no such interest
 indeed i pause cannot
 in the present context what did she mean by bust him up
 as opposed to what
 thank you but what would be the point
 obviously i am not
 i must reiterate it would be better if i went alone
 your company is not at issue your vulnerability to the microorganism is
 possible but highly unlikely in any event why risk both of us
 mister obrien energise
 i am detecting no animal life within fifty kilometres however i am reading extensive animal remains mostly fossilised
 i do not know
 the structure is rhizomatous
 i am always careful
 it appears to be dead
 if you are correct you are placing yourself in grave danger
 i would tend to agree
 not precisely geordi true fossilisation requires several millennia
 captain commander rikers injury was not accidental certain vines on the planet evidently seek out warmblooded beings and deliberately infect them
 unknown sir it is conceivable there is a symbiotic relationship involved
 there are numerous animal remains in the area leading me to hypothesize that the vines could be predatory
 it is possible for commander rikers sake i hope my hypothesis is in error
 marvellous how easily humans do that i still need much practice
 i shall endeavour to function adequately sir
 yes sir a wise procedure sir always
 no sir starfleet class of  honours in probability mechanics and exobiology
 machine correct sir does that trouble you
 understood sir prejudice is very human
 i am superior sir in many ways but i would gladly give it up to be human
 ah intriguing
 it seems to feed on our phaser energy
 enterprise
 armus has enveloped commander riker
 i believe i have found a quicker way out of here sir
 he is alive sir but just barely
 as you wish
 captain i do not believe you have the authority to promote me to the rank of admiral
 captain doctor i am honoured by your presence but may i suggest you attend the second concert
 ensign ortiz will perform the violin part my rendition will be less enjoyable
 although i am technically proficient according to my fellow performers i lack soul
 but is not honesty always the preferred choice
 indeed
 because you will lose their confidence
 hyperonic radiation also interferes with ships transporters they are now inoperable
 aye sir
 greetings gentlemen
 that is correct i am an android i am lieutenant commander data of the federation starship enterprise
 and who precisely is us
 my local informant does not have that information in the early days on tau cygna five survival was more important than history
 fifteen thousand two hundred fifty three sir
 aye sir
 lieutenant commander data of the starship enterprise
 my mission is to prepare this colony for evacuation
 because this planet belongs to the sheliak
 the term is plural the sheliak are a nonhumanoid intelligent life form classification r
 the original destination of the artemis was septimus minor
 your accomplishments are truly remarkable yet the sheliak and the federation have a treaty which clearly makes this planet sheliak domain
 that may not be possible the sheliak wish to colonise this planet and are unwilling to share it with humans if you are still here when the sheliak colony ship arrives they will eradicate you
 they have little regard for human life thus the most sensible course is to prepare a contingency plan for the evacuation of your people
 perhaps i have not made myself clear
 have you seen many
 no positronic
 im afraid i have no time to answer a million questions i have a mission to accomplish i need to know more about your people and gosheven seems unwilling to talk to me further
 the possibility does exist yet gosheven seems unwilling to prepare for it why
 i am not ordering him to do anything i am merely trying to persuade him that his people should prepare to evacuate do you believe my suggested course of action should be followed
 in spite of the fact that i am an android
 no i would say not
 and you conclude because of this that i am impartial hence you accept my recommendations yet gosheven does not
 data here
 understood sir
 aye sir we must speak to gosheven immediately
 it is water a substance composed of two atoms of hydrogen
 the sheliak will not accept humans on their planet and they will not hesitate to use force to remove you
 are his sentiments typical of the colonists
 if i can convince enough people of the necessity of leaving
 commander
 in human parlance i do not believe i can get the job done my training has prepared me for starship command duties as a cultural contact i am proving to be
 less than exemplary
 their leader refuses my counsel
 he denies the logic of my arguments and speaks of structures they have built
 i have sir
 in the last three hours and eight minutes i have spoken to fifty six colonists ten of those refused to believe a threat exists twenty two favour staying and fighting the sheliak sixteen prefer negotiation or
 some form of passive resistance only eight were willing to consider evacuation and of those eight
 sir if i do not succeed how violent is the sheliak reaction likely to be
 ah
 is there any indication that gosheven has changed his position
 so far my attempts at persuasion have been ineffective
 why did you do that
 among humans a kiss usually serves to seal a friendship or indicate support attraction affection in this context i must assume that your intention was to express support
 that is something of an understatement
 thus far that quality has not helped me to accomplish my mission
 elicit a desired behaviour by advocating its opposite that implies deception does it not
 perhaps this is a situation where excessive honesty can be detrimental
 i wish to speak
 do you consider your position so weak that it cannot withstand debate
 you know of the sheliak threat starfleet wishes to evacuate you for your own protection yet gosheven has decided otherwise that is his right and i will not waste time trying to reverse that decision i admire your conviction in the face of certain defeat though doomed your effort will be valiant and when you die you will die for land and honour your children will understand that they are dying for a worthy cause long after the battle is over their courage will be remembered and extolled
 yes that is true there will be no one left alive to remember
 i was simply attempting to describe your inevitable destruction in a manner that would have an emotional effect
 then here you die
 and you
 if you so desire
 the federation will offer as little or as much help as you dictate
 apparently that is not correct
 i appear to be reversing that defeat
 i am equipped with diagnostic circuits and am able to correct many malfunctions
 perhaps that is a part of our difficulty words are all we have been using humans seem to take much stronger notice of actions i require a phaser
 a type of weapon unfortunately it does not function in the presence of hyperonic radiation i will have to be innovative
 hyperonic radiation randomises phaser beams but i believe i can improvise a servocircuit which will compensate by continuously recollimating the output
 essentially correct get word to gosheven tell him i am coming to the pumping station tell him i am going to destroy the aqueduct
 i sincerely hope so
 stop that was the stun setting this is not
 i can reduce this pumping station to a pile of debris but i trust my point is clear i am one android with a single weapon there are hundreds of sheliak on the way and their weapons are far more powerful they may not offer you a target they can obliterate you from orbit you will die never having seen the faces of your killers the choice is yours
 i know that this is just a thing and things can be replaced lives cannot
 lieutenant commander data to enterprise i am preparing to leave tau cygna five and await rendezvous instructions
 i could not have succeeded without your support and insight i am grateful for your assistance
 i am incapable of forgetting i will remember every detail of my visit here with perfect clarity
 i do not understand
 i have no feelings of any kind
 you appeared to need it
 thank you sir
 as i have recently reminded others sir i have no feeling
 strictly speaking sir it is not my playing it is a precise imitation of the techniques of jascha heifetz and trenka bronken
 i suppose i have learned to be creative sir when necessary
 eighteen hours seven minutes and ten seconds doctor
 five minutes to launch site
 thirty seconds to impact sir
 twelve seconds to impact sir
 all systems functioning normally sir
 it is conceivable that he was viewing a synthetically generated image sir
 controls are not responding sir
 the system automatically provides for selfcorrection captain there has not been a systemswide technological failure on a starship in seventy nine years
 it is stars and stripes forever sir by john phillip sousa a popular american composer of band music in the early twentieth century
 the music is on all communications channels sir
 these are not ordinary nanites
 it is conceivable that with each new generation they enhance their own design the rate of evolution would be extraordinary
 engineering display computer core processor four five one element zero two nine nine
 increase magnification factor one thousand
 high level gamma radiation would kill them doctor
 the nanites in the upper core are all dead captain
 doctor stubbs your own actions have provided evidence to the contrary when you destroyed the nanites in the core they responded by interfering with our life support systems it is difficult to accept these as random actions by machines with loose screws in effect you may have proven that the nanites do have a collective intelligence
 with intelligence there is the capability of language but it will depend on how far their evolution has brought them we could modify the circuitry in the universal translator to make it capable of communications with them
 captain i have established contact
 as we continue captain they are virtually learning the concept of communication each new generation is making modifications
 i believe it is worth an attempt sir
 i am ready sir
 captain if a face to face negotiation would be helpful i would like to volunteer myself as a conduit
 i can easily furnish the nanites with a schematic design of my neurological structure entering my neural network would require no more than their most basic skills
 they could penetrate the molecular fabric of my handcovering into my nerve circuitry and interface with my verbal programs
 it would be a considerable risk sir but it would also represent a gesture of trust on our part it could be an important step toward peace sir
 the answer is yes
 they are ready captain
 you are very strange looking creatures
 why did you attack us
 we were seeking raw materials for our replicating process
 we meant no harm we were exploring
 we know who you are
 what is at your mercy
 we agree
 thank you but we have evolved beyond any need for your assistance this vessel has become too confining we require relocation
 ten seconds to stellar blast sir
 captain we are not receiving rana fours call sign
 no response rana four is emissions quiet
 sensors are scanning ninety degrees of longitude as we orbit i am detecting no bodies of water no vegetation no artificial structures
 that is highly unlikely rana four possessed no interstellar spacecraft
 the structure is located at the centre of the vegetation
 negative it is as you see it
 if there are indicators as to why this particular area has remained intact i cannot detect them
 botanists originally from the aquatic city new martim vaz in earths atlantic ocean residents of the rana four colony for five years you maam are eighty two years of age and a composer of tao classical music you sir are eighty five years of age and a specialist in symbiotic plant life you have been married for fifty three years i memorised the colony register on the way to rana four in the event that such information would be needed
 our vehicle classification index can put no identity to it its design is completely foreign
 they have received the message captain but are ignoring it
 the vessel has assumed a position outside of the rana system and it is rapidly increasing velocity
 i have a positive identification commander it is the vessel that attacked us earlier it is reentering the system at high velocity and is approaching rana four
 the warship is capable of striking us with far more powerful bursts
 the vessel appears undamaged sir its defences are apparently able to absorb incoming matter and energy
 captain the uxbridge house is coming into transporter range
 the warship is approaching from high orbit it is very close three hundred thousand kilometres distant
 the vessel has altered its course to a direct intercept with the enterprise
 the vessel is now within twenty thousand kilometres of the enterprise and closing
 the vessel is entering a low orbit around rana four it appears it is preparing to fire at the planet captain
 my calculations indicate that its target is the house of kevin and rishon uxbridge
 but captain will they not protest
 captain if we increase to warp seven we can be there in twenty three minutes
 the hologram generator is now functioning sir
 commander
 the area around the duck blind exhibits karst topography sinkholes underground rivers and caverns and the rock strata contain a high concentration of thallium compounds which may be obstructing our sensor beams
 correct sir
 perfectly commander i will be monitoring you continuously
 acknowledged commander
 negative commander sensors show shes in the midst of a group of mintakans
 counsellor sensors indicate five mintakans in your immediate vicinity four are motionless the fifth is eight meters away proceeding south is nuria one of these five
 was that intended to be an affirmative
 is nuria the closest of the five
 is nuria the one in motion
 locked on we can beam nuria aboard at will
 aye sir
 captain nuria is alone
 commander away team reporting in lieutenant worf standing by
 the koinonians were an intelligent culture which became embroiled in a war that lasted for several generations our best evidence indicates they destroyed themselves
 according to historical records this will be the first opportunity for a federation team
 excuse me sir am i intruding
 how well did you know lieutenant aster
 why do you ask
 but why do you ask the question since her death i have been asked several times to define how well i knew lieutenant aster and i heard you ask wesley on the bridge how well he knew jeremy does the question of familiarity have some bearing on death
 i do not sense the same feelings of absence that i associate with lieutenant yar although i cannot say precisely why
 human nature sir
 but should not the feelings run as deep regardless of who has died
 they employ a subspace proximity detonator a normal tricorder would never detect it
 it comes from the time of the koinonian wars sir
 inconclusive captain
 the pattern has no exact match in federation records sir
 a possibility
 there is a beam of highly charged particles emanating from the planet sir but i cannot pinpoint the location yet
 no intruder noted by the sensors sir
 the beam from the planet is clearly tapping into the ships antimatter captain
 the shield has severed the beam sir captain the energy field
 engaging force fields captain transporters down
 neither side intended orelious nine to be the decisive conflict
 the destruction is remarkable considering the primitive weapons of the period
 i beg your pardon wesley
 uh oh
 acknowledged
 confirmed sir
 approaching the source captain
 sensors indicate no life signs aboard captain
 there is adequate oxygen for life support commander
 i was never a boy
 activating power pack captain
 the source of the distress signal appears to be coming from up there captain
 captain i believe this is an information storage device a crude analogue of our isolinear optical chip
 questionable sir i believe i can supply power to its playback unit but its components are quite old i will attempt to amplify its image with my tricorder
 aye sir
 captain we are experiencing a two percent drop in energy reserves compensating
 captain energy loss increasing to five percent
 energy loss increasing sir
 power loss now at twelve percent captain
 there are many fascinating records of menthar battle strategy they were exceptionally innovative in fact they were the first to use the kavis teke elusive manoeuvre as well as the passive lure stratagem that is comparable to napoleons
 no sir
 they are identical to the coil we found earlier captain
 i believe so sir
 we can enhance them through the image processor in the ships computer
 captain weve been able to verify that these coils are the logs of the promellian captain but most of them have decayed and cannot be repaired
 on most there are brief sections which may yield some information
 aceton assimilators are a primitive generator which can drain power from distant sources
 it would not be difficult to modify them to convert energy into radiation
 to create this radiation field would take several hundred thousand sir
 there is no way to precisely calculate that commander but it is likely
 there is also the possibility that the phasers will supply the assimilators with what they need most energy
 energy reserves are dropping rapidly sir
 impulse engines are down
 velocity is one hundred thirty five metres per second
 starboard thruster firing
 thruster is off
 port thrusters firing
 port thruster is firing sir the gravitational attraction of the various masses has reduced our velocity by eight percent by my calculations we no longer have sufficient momentum to clear the debris field
 the asteroids gravity is drawing us closer velocity is increasing velocity still increasing now at two hundred and nineteen metres per second starboard aft thruster you have used the asteroids gravitational pull as a slingshot excellent
 a neutrino pulse would send noncharged particles back up through the atmosphere and would be detectable by geordis visor
 captain i have a new transmission on a parallel frequency to the distress call
 no sir from inside the romulan zone we should be able to view the transmission
 the neutrino stream is coming in strongly sensors are tracking the probe despite the interference
 there is no indication commander i have no way to predict
 the romulan warbird should still be twenty nine minutes away from the edge of the neutral zone
 the storm is beginning to subside captain we should have a window in less than an hour
 scanners are showing a window captain
 nine minutes forty seconds sir
 the electromagnetic window on the planet is closing sir three minutes remain
 the window is allowing intermittent sensor readings there are still numerous ghost images but i believe we are picking up two life forms near the beacon
 i cannot say the electromagnetic interference prevents an accurate reading
 the data from the barzans probe of the wormhole are quite impressive captain the wormhole delivered the probe beyond the denkiri arm in the gamma quadrant
 the same distance could be achieved in a matter of seconds through the wormhole
 the barzans do not have manned space travel so they had to resort to an automated probe its findings are limited it cannot be determined from these charts how stable the wormhole really is or how long it will remain intact
 proverbial lemon
 i would also like to volunteer sir
 there is a bright side geordi you will have me to talk to
 it is visible captain
 distorted and intense energy fields which appear to be stabil
 monitors are functioning normally again
 curious we are not where we are supposed to be
 according to the barzan probe we should be in the gamma quadrant but these readings clearly indicate we are nearly two hundred light years away in sector three five five six of the delta quadrant
 perhaps the readings were correct their probe could have exited the wormhole at a completely different location
 gravitational acceleration is also increasing
 this is not a speculation doctor we are not where the barzans said we should be which would indicate
 this side of the wormhole is not stable
 thrusters at half power three quarters
 captain this end of the wormhole is currently stable but the other end apparently shifts positions periodically
 the barzan probe had no way to recognise this eventually both sides will be unstable
 commander i am detecting life signs from behind that door
 it is a likely hypothesis the nomadic marauders who refer to themselves as gatherers have raided other outposts in neighbouring sectors
 the federation has charted but not explored several class m planets in that area any one of these planets might well serve as a base
 captain i am detecting life readings from the planet surface as well as several small areas of thermal radiation and carbon dioxide emissions indicative of combustion
 is that not what i said
 noranium alloy sir its salvage value is quite low
 rigelian phaser rifles sir not particularly powerful
 two thousand three hundred fourteen degrees of course noranium carbide
 sir acamar three has agreed to your request for access to their databases they are now being transmitted into our computer over subspace link
 commander im afraid the only entry we have on volnoth in the acamarian database is a birth record
 yes sir he was a member of the lornak clan he was captured while leading a gatherer raid on an acamarian outpost he died of a heart attack before his trial ended
 commander chorgan the present leader of the gatherers is also from the lornak clan
 commander eighty years ago the lornaks massacred a rival clan the tralestas it ended a feud that had lasted for two hundred years
 according to these records there were no survivors the tralestas were annihilated
 sir i believe i have found a correlation between the two deaths your missing link that is penthormul being led from his trial
 behind him and to the left sir
 the computer can extrapolate and reconstruct the rest of the face sir
 as henry a friend
 under sir thomas erpingham
 even as men wrecked upon a sand that look to be washed off the next tide
 no nor it is not meet he should for though i speak it to you i think the king is but a man as i am the violet smells to him as it doth to me in his nakedness he appears but a man therefore his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his army
 methinks i could not die anyplace so contented as in the kings company his cause being just and his quarrel honourable
 the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant
 freeze programme thank you sir i plan to study the performances of olivier branagh shapiro kullnark
 captain why should a king wish to pass as a commoner if he is the leader should he not be leading
 sir will i be able to schedule a performance for the crew in the near future
 fortyone seconds sir
 scout ship is severely damaged captain engines inoperative shields are down
 coordinates one four zero by two zero five sir
 five kilometres sir
 massive power failure to the scout ship sir all systems are going offline including life support
 commander that would not be an atypical romulan ploy in their long history of war the romulans have rarely attacked first they prefer to test their enemys resolve
 that would also not be an atypical romulan ploy sir
 captain permission to observe the interrogation
 there is no unusual activity in the nelvana system sir
 nothing on the sensors
 not necessarily doctor the romulans have the same capability to direct the impact of their weapons as we do
 you wanted to see me captain
 i will start my calibrations sir
 is there something else you require of me captain
 i will begin immediately sir is that all
 they are concerned of course captain but confident do you not see that sir
 sensors are configured for planetary probe sir ready for launch
 probe on course sensors are functioning
 your gut
 but those qualities would interfere with rational judgment would they not
 then why not rely strictly on the facts
 they can lead to wrong conclusions but they cannot lie
 the facts to date would lead to an objective conclusion that he is not
 with their pants
 because your gut tells you so
 so a person fills in missing pieces of the puzzle with his own personality resulting in a conclusion based as much on instinct and intuition as on fact
 but what does one do if he has no instinct and intuition
 as the probe went into orbit around nelvana three it began picking up low level subspace radio emissions
 no sir the patterns are clearly artificial
 cloaked romulan ships could produce that effect
 that would be an incorrect assumption
 i was attempting to ascertain what my guts tell me about you
 i do not find that concept particularly appealing
 i am told by various crewmembers that this viewport is their favourite on the ship
 i am afraid they would require the molecular structure of the beverage in question and as you are no doubt aware our knowledge of your planet is quite limited
 am i correct in assuming you regret your decision to come here
 it does appear unlikely you will ever be allowed to return to your planet
 but perhaps we can bring romulus to you
 run programme
 after you
 you are free to stay here as long as you wish
 cancel programme
 approaching nelvana system
 scanning the planet sir no life forms no power sources no weapons systems
 no sir
 i am picking them up sir but i cannot identify the source they seem to be moving in an orbital path with an eight hundred kilometre apogee
 there is no scarring on the planet surface that would denote heavy construction of any kind
 a cloaking device operating on the surface would be given away by visible distortion effects
 sir he must have known it would be impossible for us to deliver this
 yes commander
 yes sir
 we will use extreme caution
 specifications on the vessel mister worf
 heading mister crusher
 scan the drive section for life form readings
 bring us around to the back side of the asteroid mister crusher
 apparently he did not survive
 i am afraid the prisoner has eluded us sir
 we followed procedures precisely captain scanners indicated no life forms present in the drive section i cannot explain how he escaped
 commander i believe i can recalibrate our sensors to read through the electromagnetic interference over the poles
 there he is commander you were correct
 there are still no life form readings coming from the vessel
 i have compensated still no readings
 he is coming about sir
 shields have been automatically activated tractor beam disengaged
 i do not believe that will be necessary captain he is no longer in the drive section
 i anticipated that diversionary tactic based on his pattern to date we are picking up a cylindrical object approximately seven metres in length and three metres in diameter
 yet there are still no life form readings
 yes sir there is nothing wrong with the ships sensors the reason we did not sense life signs aboard the escape vessel is because the prisoner has no life signs
 our sensors can identify artificial lifeforms sir apparently he is capable of deceiving the sensors
 yes counsellor we are copying records for federation inspection pursuant to their application for admittance
 there is no police record
 lunar five is a military prison facility
 that may provide an explanation for the tactics he was able to use against us when we tried to capture him
 he served in many campaigns during the tarsian war received two promotions to the rank of subhadar a very honourable tour of duty
 perhaps that would explain why our sensors did not detect him
 counsellor did no one try to adjust their programming
 am i disturbing you
 then i will leave
 i am an android i believe you and i have something in common
 yes we have both been programmed
 i do not mean to belittle your condition i understand your dilemma but i am curious my programme can be altered yours cannot
 without further analysis of your condition from counsellor troi or doctor crusher i cannot say but i believe it is possible
 i cannot answer that
 no but my programme does include military strategy that is how i was able to anticipate your final tactic and capture you
 except that i am not programmed to kill
 i am incapable of any feeling
 nor do i
 i too
 coordinates received sir
 general quarters sounded sir
 sir unauthorised access of turbolift five on deck thirty four
 four seconds to arrival sir
 sir containment field down on deck thirty six
 captain someone in engineering is attempting to override the security system lockout
 as he bypasses each subsystem i can reroute it without his knowledge
 danar is extremely adept sir i am not certain which security measure he is attempting to circumvent sir danar has succeeded in restoring power to shuttlebay two
 i have overridden danars bypass shuttlebay two is once again inactive
 lieutenant i am reading an open panel k twelve j nine deck thirty
 captain reading another open access panel
 sir i find it highly unlikely that danar would be attempting to reach shuttlebay two
 in our previous encounter danar employed a strategy of misdirection in an attempt to gain his objective
 he is aware that our sensors are unable to track him yet he seems to be purposely leaving a trail for us to follow
 i am afraid his true destination remains a mystery readings now indicate an open access panel in jeffries tube n eleven deck thirty eight
 they appear to be empty sir
 aye sir
 sensors show anestazine concentration seventy parts per million within the cargo bays
 explosion in jefferies tube section t nine five all external sensors inoperative
 unable to transfer control sir
 negative sir all external sensors still nonfunctioning
 captain the prime minister is hailing us priority one
 it is against their nature to do so captain
 prime minister if you have the skills to create a master soldier can you not contradict the effect
 have you tried sir
 we have only a few minutes before our next meeting doctor
 doctor i believe it would be prudent to return to the enterprise there are physicians on this planet
 captain there has been an incident
 a bomb has been detonated by ansata terrorists
 vulnerable sir
 sir ive recommended such a course but there are several wounded people and doctor crusher
 is insisting on attending to
 aye sir
 a transporter would leave residual ionization in the air our tricorder readings found no trace after the incident
 we have been unable to detect a signal from her communicator either it has been deactivated or she is being held in a shielded location
 a subspace field coil with an isolated power source curious
 that could possibly indicate subspace transition rebound during transport
 are you referring to the elway theorem
 but the elway theorem proved to be entirely inaccurate all research was abandoned by the midtwenty third century
 but it was proven to be fatal to use this technology would be an irrational act
 captain anyone who is willing to transport in this manner would suffer significant internal damage that could be detected
 a dimensional jump can create subspace pressure modulation captain by setting up a magnetosphere echogram that can monitor each of their movements we may be able to collect enough data to trace their power source
 dimensional shifting is such an unstable procedure sir that i cannot say sir i am finding it difficult to understand many aspects of ansata conduct much of their behavioral norm would be defined by my programme as unnecessary and unacceptable
 but if that is so captain why are their methods so often successful i have been reviewing the history of armed rebellion and it appears that terrorism is an effective way to promote political change
 yet there are numerous examples where it was successful the independence of the mexican state from spain the irish unification of  and the kensey rebellion
 then would it be accurate to say that terrorism is acceptable when all options for peaceful settlement have been foreclosed
 casualties reported on deck twelve sickbay responding
 they are moving interdimensionally neither transporters nor forcefields will contain them sir
 sensors indicate it is located thirty metres below the ground implying a cavernlike dwelling
 our readings show no evidence of any commander
 aye sir
 the satellites trajectory is continuing to deteriorate captain this orbit will put it within five hundred kilometres of the planet surface
 no doctor it is a most unusual phenomenon
 the total mass of the moon would remain the same commander and the impact of thousands of fragments would spread destruction over an even wider area
 twenty nine hours sir projecting it somewhere on the western continent that would destroy an area eight hundred kilometres in radius
 delta vee is ninety two metres per second the mass is too great we are having an effect but it is negligible
 unable to identify source
 sir he is reading as fully human
 sensors are showing broadband emissions including berthold rays
 no commander overall exposure is less than seventy five rems very low intensity more like a soft medical scan i would speculate we are being probed
 the sensors cannot identify the point of origin it seems to be coming from all around us
 on my way sir
 aye sir
 i was considering the possibility that you are telling the truth that you really are human
 an irony it means that you have achieved in disgrace what i have always aspired to be
 the human race has an enduring desire for knowledge and for new opportunities to improve itself
 oh i do not feel envy
 i feel nothing at all that is part of my dilemma i have the curiosity of humans but there are questions i will never have the answer to what is it like to laugh or cry or to experience any human emotions
 the enterprise will be dangerously close to the atmosphere
 medical assistance to engineering
 can you recommend a way to counter the effect
 geordi is trying to say that changing the gravitational constant of the universe is beyond our capabilities
 q says he has hurt his back
 the choice of meal is determined by individual taste
 although i do not require sustenance i occasionally ingest semiorganic nutrient suspension in a siliconbased liquid medium
 it would be more accurate to say it is good for me as it lubricates my biofunctions
 a wide variety of items the replicator can make anything you desire
 i have observed that the selection of food is often influenced by the mood of the person ordering
 when counsellor troi is unhappy she usually eats something chocolate
 a chocolate sundae for example although i do not speak from personal experience i have seen it have a profound psychological impact
 ive never seen anyone eat ten chocolate sundaes
 the captain and many of the crew are not yet convinced he is truly human
 that would be a most noble cause q
 i am an android not a robot
 he has provided important theoretical guidance for geordis analysis of the breel satellite captain
 i am merely stating a fact counsellor
 maintaining field integrity will be difficult geordi
 i do not perceive your skills to be in doubt q the captain is more concerned with your ability to interact successfully with his little trained minions
 human interpersonal relationships are more complex your experiences may not have adequately prepared you
 engineering to function aboard a starship or in any human activity you must learn to form relationships
 and of more immediate importance is your ability to work within groups
 geordi thinks he is in command here and he is correct
 containment fields to flight tolerance
 warp core to ninety percent
 yes captain we are unable to encompass the entire moon
 q i strongly suggest that you cooperate
 inertial mass of the moon is decreasing to approximately two point five million metric tonnes
 captain the moons trajectory has moved point three percent pointfour percent
 hull temperature rising two thousand degrees
 two thousand five hundred degrees
 captain the aliens have disappeared and so has the shuttle
 i have sir
 if your intention is to make me human q
 i do not know but it was a wonderful feeling
 the moons altitude is fifty five thousand kilometres projected orbit is circular there is no further danger to the planet
 captain we have arrived at tanuga four the away team has completed its survey of doctor apgars work and is ready to return to the ship
 ensign williams striking style is heavily influenced by geometric constructivism
 lieutenant wright has effectively fused the incongruities of the surrealists with the irrationality of dadaism
 interesting
 while suggesting the free treatment of form usually attributed to fauvism this quite inappropriately attempts to juxtapose the disparate cubistic styles of picasso and leger in addition the use of colour suggests a haphazard mlange of clashing styles furthermore the unsettling overtones of protovulcan influences
 you are welcome sir if i can be of further assistance
 captain the radiation and debris are consistent with an overload of the stations reactor core
 aye sir
 it would require construction and design specifications full orthographic representations of the krieger equipment as well as visual representations and voice analyses of the persons involved but it is possible
 the energy signature would seem to indicate a phaserlike blast
 was there anything else in the lab capable of creating this kind of energy discharge
 source
 computer identify type of radiation
 it is definitely the same radiation that penetrated deck thirty nine highly focused very powerful but of unknown origin
 the two radiation events aboard the enterprise occurred five hours twenty minutes and three seconds apart the science station exploded yesterday at almost four times that interval
 we do not have the evidence to support that conclusion at this time commander
 captain i believe we have found the source of the radiation can you join us on the bridge
 as you know captain we are looking for a phenomenon that reoccurs every five hours twenty minutes and three seconds
 we have found one such phenomenon on the planets surface
 it should not be it is a harmless lambda field generator
 we now know what is causing the bursts and why the science station exploded sir
 sensors are reading gravimetric fluctuations captain most unusual ones
 nothing i have seen before
 yes and no like a time displacement but it does not have a discernible event horizon
 confirmed the phenomenon does not have a definable centre or outer edge
 i do not have sufficient information to make an analysis as yet commander the dynamics of the radiation patterns
 scanning sensors
 sensors confirm design and specifications captain analysis of hull and engine materials conform to engineering patterns and methods of that time period
 presumed destroyed the enterprise c was last seen near the klingon outpost narendra three exactly twenty two years three months and four days ago
 it is a possibility captain if that hypothesis is correct the phenomenon we just encountered would be a temporal rift in space
 possibly the formation of a kerr loop from superstring material it would require highenergy interactions occurring in the vicinity for such a structure to be formed the rift is certainly not stable captain it could collapse at any time
 away team reporting in sir
 there is a high degree of probability that the temporal rift is symmetrical captain
 back sir the enterprise c would emerge in her own time period at almost the same instant she left
 yes sir
 perhaps her species has a perception that goes beyond linear time
 not necessarily meaningless commander the klingons regard honour above all else if the crew of the enterprisec had died fighting for the survival of a klingon outpost it would be considered a meaningful act of honour by the klingon empire
 engineering is engineering your destination as well
 if i interpret your facial expressions correctly you are preoccupied with something unpleasant
 we may never know what happens if they succeed we will not even realise that these events occurred
 firing phasers
 the klingon vessel has recloaked sir i have no readings
 commander data to captain picard
 sir sensors are showing additional instability in the time rift possibly the result of the battle with the klingons
 no sir
 shields are holding sir
 one enemy target hit sir moderate damage to their forward shields our shields are still holding minor damage to secondary hull
 one enemy target destroyed sir
 shields buckling captain they will not
 fifty two seconds sir
 power couplings severed in forward phaser banks attempting to bypass controls not responding
 the phenomenon is closing in on itself captain
 oh you are early just a moment please
 you may enter now
 i have invited you here to meet someone
 this is lal lal say hello to counsellor deanna troi
 lal this is geordi la forge
 it is an accepted custom that we wear clothing
 yes wesley lal is my child
 lal has a positronic brain one very similar to my own i began programming it at the cybernetics conference
 true but here was a new submicron matrix transfer technology introduced at the conference which i discovered could be used to lay down complex neural net pathways
 exactly wesley i realised for the first time it was possible to continue doctor soongs work my initial transfers produced very encouraging results so i brought lals brain back with me
 i have not observed anyone else on board consulting you about their procreation captain
 i decided to allow my child to choose its own sex and appearance
 i am sorry captain i did not anticipate your objections do you wish me to deactivate lal
 i have followed all of starfleet regulations to the best of my ability i expected they would be pleased
 to prepare i have scanned all available literature on parenting there seems to be much confusion on this issue one traditional doctrine insists spare the rod and spoil the child suggesting a punitive approach while another more liberal attitude would allow the child enormous freedom
 and what klingons do to their children
 does that not describe becoming a parent sir
 that is why i must attempt this sir i have observed that in most species there is a primal instinct to perpetuate themselves until now i have been the last of my kind if i were to be damaged or destroyed i would be lost forever but if i am successful with the creation of lal my continuance is assured i understand the risk sir and i am prepared to accept the responsibility
 correct
 that is why you must choose a gender lal to complete your appearance
 access your data bank on sexuality level two that will define the parameters
 no lal that would be confusing we are taking you to the holodeck to show you several thousand composites i have programmed you may choose from them
 this is a big decision
 counsellor lal has narrowed the choices to four would you like to see
 computer lal gender sequence finalists begin an andorian female
 that could make socialisation more difficult a human male
 a human female
 a klingon male
 i have completed the assembly of the replicated anatomy i was able to provide lal with more realistic skin and eye colour than my own
 this is home lal
 yes we are a family lal chair to sit in sit good painting
 yes i will teach you to recognise the artistry in paintings
 yes very good lal you have correctly processed the sense of touch there are many fascinating experiences i wish to share with you
 no that is a flower lal inhale
 yes
 the transfer itself is fairly simple each neural pathway in my brain is duplicated precisely in hers theoretically the duplicate brains should be able to store and process the same information but until all of the transfers are complete we will not know for certain
 she studies in our quarters she requires very little supervision lal is quite selfsufficient
 she already has access to the sum of human knowledge from me
 she is only two weeks old
 lal the third crosslink transfer series is complete
 purpose
 that is a complex question lal i can only begin to answer by telling you that our function is to contribute in a positive way to the world in which we live
 because you are my child
 these questions suggest that we have made a successful transfer of the heuristic associative pathways you will now begin to process information on logic aesthetics metaphysics and epistemology you are truly becoming sentient lal
 by developing the awareness to examine and question your perceptions
 tomorrow will be your first day of school lal
 a perfect score
 i see
 that would seem to be reasonable
 it is a human physiological response to humour
 deck fifteen lal
 the children were not laughing with you they were laughing at you
 one is meant kindly the other is not
 because you are different differences sometimes scare people i have learned that some of them use humour to hide their fear
 doctor i require your advice as a successful parent
 lal is realising she is not the same as other children
 she does not feel the emotion of loneliness but she can observe how isolated she is from the others she wishes to be more like them i do not know how to help her lal is passing into sentience it is perhaps the most difficult stage of her development
 that is precisely what happened to lal in school how did you help him
 i have not told lal how difficult it was for me to assimilate i did not wish it to discourage her perhaps this was an error of judgement
 i can give her attention doctor but i am incapable of giving her love
 guinan
 guinan lal needs to observe human behaviour
 and for this opportunity she is willing to provide services to assist you
 that would be most beneficial
 you have used a verbal contraction
 it is a skill my programme has never mastered
 no you have exceeded my abilities i do not object but i do not understand how this has occurred
 aye sir
 i am certain the admiral is anxious to meet lal i have been sending him regular status reports on her development
 her environment sir
 then he wishes to relocate us
 i would not be in favour of that sir there are many things that she can learn only from me my lifetime of experiences the mistakes i have made and what i have learned from them
 then he is questioning my ability as a parent
 does the admiral have children
 i am forced to wonder how much experience he had as a parent when his first child was born
 commander what are your intentions toward my daughter
 it is a limitation we must learn to accept lal
 i have asked myself that many times as i have struggled to be more human until i realised it is the struggle itself that is most important we must strive to be more than we are lal it does not matter that we will never reach our ultimate goal the effort yields its own rewards
 it is the difference between knowledge and experience
 so lal now possesses the sum of my programming
 there do seem to be some variations on the quantum level she can use contractions i cannot
 i have maintained records on positronic matrix activity behavioral norms and all verbal patterns i have seen no evidence of other aberrations
 is that not the goal of every parent sir
 i am programmed with the procedures you mention sir and in any meaningful evaluation of lal you would require a model for a basis of comparison i am the only model available admiral
 no sir
 it is an opportunity for her to observe human behaviour and more importantly for her to interact with her crewmates
 may i ask why sir
 admiral when i created lal it was in the hope that someday she would choose to enter the academy and become a member of starfleet i wanted to give something back in return for all starfleet has given me i still do but lal is my child you ask that i volunteer to give her up i cannot it would violate every lesson i have learned about human parenting i have brought a new life into this world and it is my duty not starfleets to guide her through these first difficult steps to maturity to support her as she learns to prepare her to be a contributing member of society no one can relieve me from that obligation and i cannot ignore it i am her father
 lal is programmed to return to the lab in the event of a malfunction
 yes lal i am here
 it appears to be a symptom of cascade failure it would require initialisation the base matrix without wiping out the higher functions
 thank you admiral
 lal i am unable to correct the system failure
 we must say goodbye now
 what do you feel lal
 i wish i could feel it with you
 lal suffered complete neural system failure at thirteen hundred hours i have deactivated the unit
 i thank you for your sympathy but she is here her presence so enriched my life that i could not allow her to pass into oblivion so i incorporated her programs back into my own i have transferred her memories to me
 the unhatched eggs of a large scaleless
 commander ships sensors detect an abnormal energy reading in the captains quarters
 undetermined
 correct sir
 a great deal sir it is a rotating neutron star of approximately four point three five six solar masses
 aye sir
 enter
 you are always welcome captain
 that beats my fours
 commander there is still one fact we have not considered the abnormal energy reading in the captains quarters was never explained
 sir at twenty million kilometres our shields will only be effective for eighteen minutes
 aye sir
 captain number four shield has failed increasing power to number three shield to compensate
 sir at that distance the ship will not withstand the magnetic fields and radiation we will not survive
 captain sensors report the uss hood is closing on an intercept course at high warp
 sir the hood is slowing to impulse
 sir
 i am data an android
 our destination is the beta stromgren system following the path of the vega nine probe
 that is correct commander apparently the probe has discovered astonishing
 our orders are to proceed to this star beta stromgren scientists have discovered that it is in the final stages of an alternating cycle of expansion and collapse and will soon result in a supernova however the unmanned long range space probe sent by starfleet to observe the process has discovered something much more
 they routinely monitor the telemetry of our deep space probes
 that is correct starbase one two three has detected two ddaridex class cruisers on an intercept course the top speed of this class cruiser is known to be less than ours therefore we do have some advantage
 aye sir
 since there is no known natural phenomenon capable of travel at warp velocities there are but two possibilities either it is a sensor malfunction another ship is following us covertly
 agreed
 lieutenant continue monitoring the precise position of the echo any sudden change in its behaviour initiate yellow alert
 captain we are receiving relayed sensor data from the vega probe including visuals
 in fact we are commander however
 captain it would appear that the romulans intent is to contact tin man first at any cost according to my sensor readings the warbird has exceeded maximum engine output by thirty percent they seem to have irreparable damage to their warp coils
 aye sir
 yes i have configured these instruments to display information with greater speed and efficiency than stations used by the others
 spartan
 i have tried it from time to time but you are correct i do not require rest
 the creatures anatomy appears most peculiar
 it is indeed laid out as a vessel with what appear to be corridors and chambers an internal environment suitable for carbon based life forms is being maintained yet there is no evidence of a crew aboard tin man is a living being which has been bred or has adapted itself to serve a purpose i find that interesting
 i do not believe i am qualified to express an opinion
 you said in the transporter room that you could not read my mind
 perhaps there is nothing to read nothing more than mechanisms and algorithmic responses
 captain the romulan ship is hailing the alien using their equivalent of linguacode
 nothing so far commander
 captain i agree that tams motives are trustworthy and i do not believe it is possible that he will act against us or will cause tin man to act against us out of malice
 i am puzzled sir we have come this far are you not going to allow tam to fulfill his mission
 i believe i understand sir if you feel the risk is too great to send tam elbrun alone then send me with him
 but he is more comfortable with me sir it is humanity he is fleeing sir i can serve as an intermediary a bridge back a reminder of his obligations both to us and to tin man
 tam
 data to enterprise enterprise come in
 if it is harming you we must return enterprise respond
 there is a large chamber twenty metres ahead
 intriguing
 is that the purpose of existence to care for someone
 i must remind you that our objective is to bring tin man out of danger and report our findings to starfleet
 but our mission
 sir
 difficult to explain captain
 i believe he found what he was looking for counsellor
 yes counsellor it was tams final request that i explain his decision to the crew but i believe his hope was that you would understand
 i witnessed something remarkable individually they were both so
 yes but no longer through joining they have been healed grief has been transmuted to joy loneliness to belonging
 yes counsellor when tin man returned me to the enterprise i realised this is where i belong
 pardon me but why is lieutenant barclay being referred to clandestinely as a vegetable
 nicknames generally denote fondness a diminutive shared between friends
 nucleosynthesis the structure of the glass has been altered at the atomic level
 unlikely a problem with the replicator would have affected the contents as well as the glass but the liquid in the glass was a synthehol replication of a light ale of earth origin which is i believe what lieutenant duffy ordered
 the most probable explanation is that the glass came into contact with an unshielded power source
 then it is possible these two very disparate incidents could be related
 it was lieutenant barclay who first suggested a link between the two incidents
 metathesis is one of the most common of pronunciation errors sir a reversal of vowel and consonant barc to broc
 you are outnumbered mister barclay say you will yield and it ends here
 compensating sir
 the matterantimatter injectors locked for a split second i am not certain why sir they appear to be working properly now
 controls are not responding sir
 speed increasing sir warp seven point six seven point six five warp seven point seven
 at this rate of acceleration fifteen minutes forty seconds sir
 the plasma flow to the nacelles is uneven due to injector lock an emergency saucer separation could rupture the warp field
 twelve minutes to structural failure sir
 injector conduit temperature minus one hundred degrees celsius
 ready sir temperature now minus one hundred ninety degrees minus two hundred degrees sir
 matter injector is online antimatter injector still locked
 antimatter injector online reducing flow capacity commencing warp engine shut down sir
 data to enterprise
 this will be the last trip sir
 the remaining cases of hytritium are now being loaded
 loading is complete i am proceeding with departure enterprise shuttlebay two prepare for docking level one precautions for incoming material remain in effect
 what am i doing here
 why have i been brought here
 ive been delivered here against my wishes i would like to know the reason
 am i to infer that you intend to keep me captive
 it is my name
 i wish to leave
 this is unacceptable sir i have no desire to remain here and even if i did my starfleet duties would not allow it
 then i am forced to attempt escape
 then you will have to open it for me
 i fail to understand the value you place on my presence
 i thought they were extinct
 i am not sir most intelligent lifeforms find involuntary confinement offensive and inequitable moreover you have violated federation law
 i must emphasize mister fajo that i consider this captivity a hostile act on your part
 i have no reason to accede to mister fajos wishes
 mister fajo is deluding himself if he believes he can keep me here the enterprise is certain to find me
 they will scan the debris and discover i was not aboard
 clearly mister fajo has no moral difficulty with my imprisonment here
 do you
 yes are you my enemy
 why
 do you object to the question
 it appears he has us both
 i am a starfleet officer
 even if i chose to do so it is doubtful that my programming could be sufficiently altered to accede to your wishes
 i have been designed with a fundamental respect for life in all its forms and a strong inhibition against causing harm to living beings
 my skills seemed appropriate
 no but i am programmed with the ability to use deadly force in the cause of defense
 i would not participate in murder perhaps you misunderstand
 you are a fine debater sir it is a pity you have used your verbal gifts for mere hucksterism and the advancement of your own greed
 your past does not excuse unethical or immoral behaviour sir
 i must decline
 proceeding with departure enterprise shuttlebay two prepare for docking level one precautions remain in effect
 proceeding with departure enterprise shuttlebay two prepare for docking level one precautions remain in effect shuttle has cleared the jovis cargo bay
 loading is complete i am proceeding with departure enterprise shuttlebay two prepare for docking level one precautions remain in effect
 you may expect me to use every means at my disposal to resist your wishes
 i do not intend to sit in the chair
 it is a disruptor
 the varont disruptor is banned in the federation
 it is a most lethal weapon
 it is doubtful you will destroy me since you assign so much value to possessing me
 fajo
 the consequences if we are caught
 perhaps i should attempt to communicate with the enterprise
 i am trained in evasive manoeuvres
 you will surrender yourself to the authorities
 i cannot permit this to continue
 yes commander please arrange to take kivas fajo into custody on charges of murder kidnapping theft
 a varont disruptor it belongs to fajo
 perhaps something occurred during transport commander
 i expected nothing
 so it seems
 unlikely sir your collection has been confiscated all of your stolen possessions are being returned to their rightful owners you have lost everything you value
 no sir it does not i do not feel pleasure i am only an android
 i have been programmed to reproduce the individual musical styles of over three hundred concert violinists including heifetz menuhin graktay and tataglia do you have a preference
 i hope you find the performance pleasing
 yes it is normally occupied by captain picard commander riker and counsellor troi
 halfbetazoid her father was human
 her skills are empathic in nature she is able to sense the emotions of other beings
 extensive the captains first diplomatic contact dates back to
 do you foresee such a circumstance occurring is ambassador sarek unable to
 aye sir
 captain picard is not satisfied with ki mendrossens assurances that the ambassador is in good health do you consider sarek capable of carrying out his mission
 you have voiced certain reservations to me about his abilities
 not directly no but you did question me about the diplomatic capabilities of both captain picard and counsellor troi
 then you must decide which is your greater obligation your loyalty to sarek or your duty to the federation can you accept the logic of continuing this mission
 sakkath has been able until recently to use his telepathic skills to reinforce sareks emotional control thus protecting others from the effects of his deterioration
 the strain of this mission on sarek has made it impossible
 sir it is conceivable even for me that time will eventually lead to irreparable circuit failure but there is one thing i do not understand sarek is a logical intelligent being the effects of bendii syndrome are apparent why would such a man choose to ignore them
 captain commander
 commander the legarans are ready to beam aboard
 perhaps your telepathic abilities are ineffective owing to the anomalous construction of the ferengi brain which is composed of four different
 that is correct sir although commander la forge and i designed the chip mister crusher derived the equation governing its operation
 wesley congratulations on passing your starfleet written examination an excellent achievement
 there is no guarantee that wesley will be reassigned to the enterprise ninety one per cent of starfleet graduates are not posted to galaxy class starships on their first assignment
 is that not a part of the human experience growth and change
 initial scans of ionisation patterns complete sir now correlating sensor readings
 actually it is five point three four times ten to the forty first watts sir well within the norm for this type of phenomena
 lieutenant foley discovered this in the pond togs bouquet the species is zan periculi it is not indigenous to betazed but to lappa four a ferengi world
 do you wish to leave orbit sir
 ferengi transmissions are routinely scrambled and encoded sir without breaking the code we will be unable to identify any specific ferengi vessel
 the repetitive nature of the subcarrier pattern would imply a modified
 mister crusher is correct sir there is a temporal correlation
 radiation levels within acceptable limits
 i am picking up a scattering of debris in extended orbit around the planet it reads as refined metals and other synthetic compounds
 it will take time sir downloading this into our system will require fabrication of a matrix translator to emulate the aliens computer system
 aye sir
 i agree geordi but the data matrix within the capsule does not correspond to any standard format all we have been able to determine is that the device contains a chemically based system for molecular energy encoding
 the compact shape does suggest a rapid chemical processing and storage capacity
 an intriguing experiment the capsule might provide us with information without the need to decode the storage medium itself perhaps we should examine your theory immediately
 are you suggesting that it employs memory rna like an organic cell
 perhaps the information sequences are encoded in the molecular patterns themselves
 it appears that your hypothesis was correct geordi
 we have determined that the storage cube from john does escape pod contains navigational information
 computer run transformational matrix calculations match navigational referents to known stars in this sector
 computer assume those paths are course corrections and derive gravitational values for stellar objects near those flight paths
 most of these are ordinary gtype stars this would appear to be a neutron star possibly a pulsar
 computer assume these symbols are pulsars translate associated values into standard temporal notations computer is there a pulsar with a rotational period of one point five two four four seconds within sensor range
 that bearing is almost directly along our planned course sir
 captain the ship is travelling at warp nine point seven two
 at present course and speed ten hours fifty three minutes
 captain the alien vessel is coming within weapons range its shields are up
 captain on screen alien vessel approaching at half impulse sir heading zero five one mark one one four
 they are scanning us captain
 i am afraid i cannot answer that wesley and as you are a newcomer to the game may i say it is inappropriate for you to ask i will buy another card counsellor
 not necessarily commander riker may be bluffing wesley
 early bird i believe commander shelby erred there is no evidence of avifaunal or crawling vermicular lifeforms on jouret four
 that is a reasonable conclusion borg technology has given each member of their society the ability to interface and function collectively it is likely they have constructed their ship with the same philosophy
 one hour seventeen minutes sir
 uncertain commander but the dimensions are precisely the same
 holding sir
 still no damage to the borg vessel sir
 eleven dead eight more unaccounted for captain
 eighty two percent dilithium hydroxyls magnesium chromium it should provide an effective screen against their sensors captain
 conceivably the ships power distribution nodes are vulnerable to those frequencies
 two hours forty minutes and three seconds
 at our first encounter the borg virtually ignored us when we beamed aboard their vessel clearly they did not consider our being there a threat to them
 these appear to be some kind of power wave guide conduits which allow them to work collectively as they perform ship functions
 interesting metaphor doctor what is your idea
 distribution nodes
 we were unable to retrieve him sir sir the captain has been altered by the borg
 we were unable to retrieve him sir sir the captain has been altered by the borg
 data to riker message from starfleet captain
 starfleet reports
 it has engaged the borg at wolf three fifty nine sir
 admiral hanson on subspace captain
 thank you sir
 doctor crusher and i have been working on an interesting premise
 robots small enough to enter living cells
 no active subspace fields negligible power readings
 negative sir
 it could indicate the course of the borg ship sir
 aye captain
 shuttle launch sequence confirmed departing enterprise in exactly three seconds
 the shuttle escape transporter should provide enough power to beam us
 onto the borg ship from here sir
 firing shuttle thrusters
 using multimodal reflection sorting i have been able to detect a complex series of subspace signals between locutus and the borg ship
 it is not just a matter of control doctor the signals are interactive across a subspace domain similar to that of a transporter beam i would hypothesise that these frequencies form the basis of the borgs collective consciousness
 possibly but as you may recall on several occasions we have witnessed the borg removing key circuits from injured comrades no doubt separating them from the group consciousness
 that is correct sir
 then perhaps there is a way i can access the machine doctor
 the initial cybernetic connection into captain picards neural net pathways has been established mister obrien is ready to process the borg signal through the transport pattern buffer
 proceeding immediately sir data out
 the neural link will be established in three stages doctor i suggest you closely observe captain picards lifesigns while at each stage chief obrien monitors my positronic matrix activity counsellor hopefully you will be able to determine whether i am reaching captain picard
 i do not know i have never done this before initiating first neural link
 first neural connection is confirmed i cannot report any significant access to the borg consciousness
 second neural connection is confirmed i still cannot report any significant access proceeding with the final link
 neural connections complete i have access to the borg subspace signals processing processing
 stand by processing processing fascinating the borg group consciousness is divided into subcommands necessary to carry out all functions defence communication navigation they are all controlled by a root command implanted into each
 negative the subspace signal configuration is unchanged what is causing the increased neural activity is unclear
 i have been unable to create a neural path around the borg implants sir it is captain picard himself who has somehow managed to initiate contact
 sir it is clear the borg are either unwilling or unable to terminate their subspace links
 it is conceivable sir but it would require altering the pathway from the root command
 to affect all iterative branch points in the
 sir
 what command shall i try to plant
 attempting to reroute subcommand paths captain defence systems are protected by access barriers
 i am unable to penetrate defence systems command structure
 captain
 acknowledged
 attempting new power subcommand path
 i cannot penetrate borg power subcommand structure sir
 all critical subcommands are protected captain
 yes doctor but if i may make a supposition i do not believe his message was intended to express fatigue but to suggest a course of action
 data to bridge stand by
 i am attempting to penetrate the borg regenerative subcommand path it is a low priority system and may be accessible
 stand by
 i successfully planted a command into the borg collective consciousness sir it misdirected them to believe it was time to regenerate in effect i put them all to sleep
 yes sir
 we should also consider the advantages of further examination of the borg and their vessel sir
 sir may i remind you that during the galen border conflict it was a common tactic of the talarians was to abandon their observation craft rig them to self destruct
 that particular guerrilla manoeuvre resulted in two hundred and nineteen fatalities over a three day period
 negative sir the talarians employ a subspace proximity detonator it is not detectable by our scans
 data to picard
 we have received a subspace communiqu from starfleet command regarding the young human sir
 by matching dna gene types starfleet was able to identify the boy as jeremiah rossa
 she is his grandmother captain he was born fourteen years ago on the federation colony galen four his parents connor and moira rossa were killed three years nine months later when their colony was overrun by talarian forces
 the boy was listed as missing presumed dead
 the talarians are a rigidly patriarchical society sir
 qmaire at station holding steady at bearing zero one three mark zero one five distance five oh six kilometres
 negative sir
 talarian warships are limited to neutral particle weapons high energy xray lasers and merculite rockets no match for the enterprise captain
 if endar respects talarian custom he may have to according to their tradition a male child of fourteen has reached the age of decision he then undergoes a ceremony of initiation after which he has the freedom to make his own choices
 that is called a spoon
 i fail to understand why this is amusing
 comedy stressing farce and horseplay ah this no doubt is a variation on pie in the face
 no sir but i will take your word for it it is very amusing
 on my way sir
 theyve been made fully aware of the situation sir
 aye sir
 fortunately we are only two days from starbase four one six and their laboratory can isolate
 computer recognise data lieutenant commander alpha one clearance

 i fail to recall how i arrived here
 and who are you sir data to enterprise enterprise do you read me
 we were heading for a medical facility i was taking the boys brother to sickbay and
 i must find a way to contact the enterprise
 you do bear a resemblance to doctor noonian soong the cyberneticist who constructed me but doctor soong was killed shortly afterward by the crystalline entity
 but the colony was destroyed there were no survivors
 it is really you
 sir
 it was starfleet officers who rescued me
 what choice of vocation would have met with your approval sir
 to follow in your footsteps as it were
 may i ask you a question sir
 why did you create me
 old things
 there are many possible explanations
 perhaps for humans old things represent a tie to the past
 humans are mortal they seem to need a sense of continuity
 to give their lives meaning a sense of purpose
 i suppose it is a factor in the human desire to procreate
 it is a reasonable explanation to your query sir
 lore
 i implore you do not reactivate him
 but he admitted to an alliance with the crystal entity to gain its favour he betrayed the colonists and would have betrayed the enterprise as well had i not
 i had no alternative you would have destroyed the enterprise
 dying from what sir
 lore told me the colonists envied him because you made him so completely human
 lore also told me the colonists petitioned you to replace him with a less perfect android
 it was a lie another lie
 i am not less perfect than lore
 i am not less perfect than lore
 i question your sincerity lore
 but sir lore was responsible for
 he surprised me
 what has happened here doctor doctor soong
 lore sir he was inadvertently summoned here by the same signal which activated my homing circuitry it seems that after nearly two years in interstellar space he was
 i was unaware of having caused any inconvenience sir
 but sir our medical facility may be able to
 may i say goodbye to doctor soong sir alone sir
 do you believe that we are in some ways alike sir
 then it is alright for you to die because i will remain alive you know that i cannot grieve for you sir
 goodbye father
 yes sir the boys appear to have reconciled their differences
 i will raise you three
 i will see your ten and raise you twenty
 it will cost you twenty to make that determination sir
 yes sir i believe i have
 your guidance is much valued counsellor however
 eleven
 not at all counsellor you surreptitiously placed the edge of your left thumb against the card when you divided the deck to reshuffle you kept that card on top you thus were able to have me either save or discard depending on the location of the card which you followed at each step until we were left with just one the card i originally chose sir i believe under the circumstances
 we will be entering the turkana system in eleven minutes captain
 stable but we have maintained warp factor nine for longer than is recommended sir
 seven minutes and fifteen seconds will bring us within transporter range captain
 we are now entering the turkana system sir
 visual contact
 i am reading an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escape pod
 that is exactly where the ion trail is leading commander
 the last federation vessel to make contact was the potemkin six years ago they were warned that anyone transporting down to the colony would be killed
 the surface settlement appears to be all but destroyed sensors show that the colonists now live in structures that extend nearly three kilometres beneath the city
 the dispersion trail continues in this direction the concentration gradient definitely increases along this vector the escape pod was apparently moved into the tunnels ahead of us
 a former crewman was born here
 she was killed in the line of duty
 welcome to the enterprise ishara i am commander data
 i am an android
 on what do you base that assumption
 the enterprise is not a ship of war it is a ship of exploration
 my orders are to escort you to the observation lounge please come with me
 your sister never spoke of you
 it is surprising to me tasha and i spent much time together we had a considerable number of conversations
 only to say that she was lucky to have escaped
 cowardice is a term that i have never heard applied to tasha
 no it is just that for a moment the expression on your face reminded me of her
 a sensing device from the escape pod it monitors the bioelectric signatures of the crew in the event they get separated from the pod
 she would have to be armed sir
 tasha exists in our memories as well
 lieutenant yar was killed on vagra two by a malevolent entity
 no she was killed as a demonstration of the creatures power without provocation
 what is this structure
 tactical station where lieutenant worf is now
 yes she was especially close to commander riker and lieutenant worf and to myself
 yes
 not as such however even among humans friendship is sometimes less an emotional response and more a sense of familiarity
 exactly as i experience certain sensory input patterns my mental pathways become accustomed to them the inputs eventually are anticipated and even missed when absent
 yes like your sister
 we could remove the implant
 a small force field containing xenon or another inert gas could be placed over the incision site the explosive could possibly be disarmed at the same time it is removed
 and tasha did not
 thank you i would like to consider you my friend as well
 ishara is willing to have the implant removed sir
 she also expressed a desire to leave the colony she hopes to apply to the academy and eventually join starfleet
 she claims to captain
 yes counsellor
 we must free the crewmen she appears to be our best hope of doing so in addition i have become used to her
 ishara
 you are welcome doctor crusher is expecting you in sickbay
 to what are you referring
 but i do have something to gain from it your continued presence on this ship is something wrong
 if you desire privacy you may use the observation lounge
 have you reconsidered your decision to stay with us
 ishara what are you doing the fusion generator is overloading you are attempting to disable the defence system for what reason we have rescued the crewmen
 the federation will be responsible for the resulting deaths i cannot allow that
 that is not so
 we will both be destroyed by the explosion
 was this your intention from the beginning
 our help was not deliberate you deceived us
 your friendship with me was part of the deception was it not you misled me at each step and yet i was completely unaware
 my duty requires me to intercede
 disabling the detection system so her forces could attack
 what do you wish to talk about
 i am an android it is not possible for me to be injured in that fashion
 energise
 recent events have left me puzzled sir it has been days since ishara left and yet my thoughts seem to dwell on her almost as if i were experiencing a feedback loop in my mnemonic network
 it is curious that i was so easily misled
 yes sir
 thank you sir
 were you prepared sir
 then it is better not to trust
 and yet you put yourself at risk
 perhaps i am fortunate sir to be spared the emotional consequences
 no changes commander i can detect no abnormalities in the stars radiant energy
 probes ready captain
 the word excuses implies ulterior motives for a conflict
 channel is open sir vorn responding to hail
 the explosive was a triceron derivative
 only one race uses that device sir
 if true it would represent a fundamental shift of power in the quadrant
 sir i find it interesting how much importance humans place on celebrating the day of their birth a day they cannot possibly remember
 it appears we are being probed sir
 the third planet of the alpha onias system our reports list it as presently uninhabited perhaps reports were incorrect sir
 although alpha onias three is a class m planet our survey teams have listed it as barren and inhospitable
 no sir but we have traced residual energy readings to a cavern two kilometres beneath the surface
 it is possible
 welcome back captain we were not expecting to see you on the bridge so soon
 do you remember sir
 on screen
 captain we were expecting the decius there is no cause for alarm
 certainly sir
 ambassador you may find this of interest these newly refined sensors are capable of pinpointing the power emissions of a cloaked warbird even at warp
 thinks at warp one in three days four hours
 pardon me sir i am experiencing subspace interference which limits my abilities i cant operate as quickly as
 i said i cannot operate
 sir i can explain if you would just give me a moment
 there is no question about it sir it is his signal
 no sir we are out of range
 negative commander
 shuttlecraft has cleared the bay sir
 scanning vessel reads as an unmanned sublight freighter
 indeterminate propulsion appears to employ a gaseous core fission reactor but it is not functioning
 no sir engine reactor elements appear to have been inactive for approximately three hundred years the vessel is carrying various unstable waste products
 precisely
 sir the meltasion asteroid belt lies between here and the sun
 structural integrity of the barge has been compromised disintegration is continuing
 external radiation levels increasing sir
 at the rate the radiation levels are increasing the hyronalin additive will only be effective for another thirty eight minutes
 fifty one minutes fourteen seconds sir
 tractor beam is holding shearing force eighty metric tons per metre
 shearing force ninety two metric tons ninety three tractor beam is destabilising se are going to lose the barge commander
 shearing force is at one hundred three metric tons tractor beam is stable
 tractor beam is holding
 we have cleared the asteroids sir
 it is definitely debris the primary material is duranium with smaller proportions of sonodanite and ermanium
 not necessarily doctor there is far too little debris to account for an entire shuttlecraft
 the only class m planets in the system are pentarus two and five both of which have been thoroughly searched by the miners
 sir there are also four moons in the pentarus system that could support life
 lambda paz one of the moons of pentarus three
 uncertain i have no unusual readings commander
 an aggregate field of planepolarised objects has just appeared and disappeared
 i have completed another full scan of the area sir there is no further indication of the anomaly
 a resumption of our present course at warp six will place us in the tlli beta system in six days thirteen hours forty seven minutes
 i have discovered sir a certain level of impatience when i calculate a lengthy time interval to the nearest second however if you wish
 all decks reporting minor injuries only
 none sir
 integrity field stress exceeding eighty two million kilodynes recommend immediate shutdown sir
 no other ship is indicated
 indeed there are many races that are not empathically detectable the breen the ferengi the
 probe launch successful telemetry transmissions are being received
 expanding analysis parameters including bayesian functions broad em and subspace spectrum polling
 i am adding virtual particle trajectories
 unknown i am attempting to analyse motion pattern results still inconclusive
 the probes point of view reveals that the objects exist entirely in two dimensions on a single plane
 that is why the ships forward sensors did not detect them initially we were looking at them along their edge there was no surface to read i will illustrate
 the movement pattern within the cluster is not a naturally occurring phenomenon in the newtonian sense they appear to be alive
 integrityfield pressure has increased by two hundred seventeen percent captain
 sir during our attempt to break away i recorded a momentary alteration of the movement pattern within the cluster
 perhaps but just for an instant the pattern immediately returned to its previous dynamic
 aye sir
 yes commander sensors are detecting highly accelerated interstellar gases
 uncertain sir the phenomenon is within visual range
 it appears to be a cosmic string fragment only one hundred seven kilometres long
 the twodimensional beings seem to be caught in the gravitational pull of the string their course is taking them directly toward it
 the entities offer no indication that they are aware of the string fragment captain their course and speed remain constant
 it is unclear what affect a photon torpedo would have on a twodimensional beings sir
 probe has been launched on screen
 there is no change in the graviton field the torpedoes are having no effect sir
 matterantimatter explosions appear to be ineffective sir
 possibly however the beings may perceive them as negligible noise rather than an attempt at communication
 negative the nature of their movement suggests a simple order of intelligence
 as i have no human instinct per se i cannot advise you counsellor
 i do not believe there is any way we can know for certain counsellor
 the only evidence we have at present is the brief interruption in their movement pattern during our last attempt to break away
 otherwise their course and speed have been constant
 because the cluster is twodimensional i do not have enough direct evidence to support that assumption however it is the most reasonable hypothesis
 it is unlikely they would intentionally move toward a destructive force
 pardon me
 please continue
 if counsellor trois supposition is correct a replica of the string projected behind the cluster could induce them to reverse course disrupting the graviton wake long enough for us to escape
 i do not suggest simulating the gravitational field of the string fragment rather the strings vibration
 frequencyscan detectors engaged
 stand by
 i am differentiating particleemission signatures now
 sir shear force turbulence is impairing our ability to create an accurate simulation
 electromagnetic and subspace wave fronts approaching synchronisation
 increasing by fifty percent
 in reference to your most recent letter i agree that your study lacks sufficient primary source information on my programming and operation therefore in response to your request this correspondence will include a complete record of my activities during a normal day with particular emphasis on my perceptions of friendship
 commander riker you are fifteen minutes early
 thank you sir
 i cannot become nervous sir however i do sense a certain anticipation regarding my role in the wedding
 all systems normal sir sickbay reports that lieutenant juarez went into labour at zero four hundred hours we remain at station awaiting the arrival of starship zhukov and guest quarters have been prepared for ambassador tpel
 aye sir
 initially commander maddox i found it difficult to maintain friendships since human emotions are often puzzling to me
 eventually i developed a programme enabling me to predict human emotional responses to specific actions
 it is time for the wedding rehearsal
 you do not wish to rehearse
 may i ask why
 have your feelings for chief obrien changed
 will cancelling the wedding make you happy
 if you wish
 my friend chief obrien often says that above all else he wants to make keiko happy since cancelling the wedding will make her happy i must conclude the chief will be pleased at her decision
 i have good news
 keiko has made a decision designed to increase her happiness she has cancelled the wedding
 commander maddox it would appear that my programme designed to predict the emotional responses needs adjustment
 energise
 welcome aboard the enterprise ambassador
 sine i am not affected by emotional considerations i am closer to being vulcan than human however while their devotion to logic does have a certain appeal i find their stark philosophy to be somewhat limited
 the tone of commander rikers voice makes me suspect that he is not serious about finding ambassador tpel charming my experience suggests that in fact he may mean the exact opposite of what he says irony is a form of expression i have not yet been able to master
 friendly insults and jibes another form of human speech that i am attempting to master in this case with the help of commander geordi la forge
 i consider geordi to be my best friend
 my hair does not require trimming you lunkhead
 my hair does not require trimming
 i am experimenting with friendly jibes and insults it was not meant as a serious disparagement
 no geordi i am still confused by chief obriens reaction this morning
 cold feet jitters a nervous reaction to an impending event of great importance
 she will
 so you believe the wedding will still proceed
 i find lieutenant worf to be what is called a kindred spirit we were both orphans rescued by starfleet officers in many ways we are both still outsiders in human society
 are you here to find a wedding gift
 i would appreciate your help in selecting an appropriate item
 this is a traditional gift
 it is my understanding that the item selected should reflect the personality of whoever is giving it this does not remind me of you have you ever been an actual participant in a human wedding
 you would not consider it to be an honour
 dancing
 i am rarely in need of doctor beverly crushers professional services as my biomechanical maintenance programme is self sufficient but i often observe as she practices medicine on others and have learned a great deal about human interaction from her
 doctor may i ask a favour of you
 would you teach me how to dance
 i would like to learn how to dance
 it was in your service record awarded first prize tap and jazz competition saint louis academy
 have i said something to upset you
 then your answer is no
 of course doctor
 acknowledged
 captain is there a specific area you wish me to study
 it is fortunate that i am able to perform my duties without emotional distractions if that were not the case a sudden course correction toward the neutral zone would make me very nervous
 personal log supplemental commander maddox there are still many dynamics of social interaction which i do not understand
 their ships are deployed to support a policy of confrontation designed to test federation defenses along the neutral zone
 i project a ninety percent probability that they will continue to support that policy
 no sir
 feline supplement seventy four
 computer run fluidic sensor diagnostic
 come in
 no would you care to sit down
 when one of my friends is distraught i have learnt that the thoughtful thing to do is to attempt to make him feel more comfortable
 may i offer you some refreshment chief
 there is no need to apologise i was not offended would you like a pillow or a more comfortable chair to sit upon
 perhaps you would like some music brahms aurelia
 would counsellor troi not be a more appropriate choice to speak with keiko
 i do not know what to say to her
 perhaps she has not fully analysed her decision i will try
 commander maddox i noted that keiko was quite calm and rational when she informed me of her decision this morning therefore i can predict that she will respond to an objective analysis of the situation based on the available facts it is fortunate that she has not let emotional considerations cloud her judgement it should make my task much simpler
 i believe you made an incorrect analysis of the facts at hand
 you do not seem happy
 your decision was based on the assumption that cancelling the wedding would bring you happiness this has proved to be incorrect
 since your action did not produce the desired results the only advisable solution should be to reexamine your decision making process and look for errors
 that fact is not in dispute however you may have acted with undue haste and in doing so unintentionally hurt chief obriens feelings
 i am your friend
 if i have offended
 it is clear that i need guidance to resolve this situation counsellor trois advice should be useful
 in many ways deanna troi is the friend that i understand the least her life and her duties are predicated on her understanding and perception of emotions since i have none no doubt she finds me as much of a mystery as i find her
 chief obrien talks to me keiko talks to you why do they not talk to each other
 many aspects of this situation are puzzling to me i have been studying various texts on the subject of marriage but i have not found a suitable guide
 in an effort to be helpful i am attempting to calculate the variables involved in a successful marriage
 there are many opinions on galvin five a marriage is considered successful only if children are produced within a year of the wedding andorian marriages require groups of four people unless
 but i am their friend should i not stand with them in a time of difficulty
 do you believe it to be the right decision for them to marry
 to grow old together that is an integral component of marriage
 although i am an android i have not excluded the possibility that i too may someday marry
 i believe i have much to offer a potential mate however we cannot grow old together because i will not grow old
 acknowledged
 that is correct ambassador
 the code is valid
 may i ask the purpose of your request
 i have the same safeguards as the ships computer therefore i must report any inquiry regarding restricted information to the captain your reaction suggests you do not wish the captain to be informed of your inquiry
 commander maddox i have often wished for the sense that humans call intuition or instinct since vulcans are incapable of lying i must accept the ambassadors explanation as the truth but i would still prefer a gut feeling to back up this conclusion
 it appears to be quite suitable doctor
 am i dancing doctor
 doctor perhaps it would be beneficial to show me the final lesson
 then i have successfully learned to dance
 thank you doctor i am now prepared to dance at the wedding
 keikos wedding
 is that important
 why
 sorry doctor
 i cannot reproduce your performance if i cannot see your feet
 lead where doctor
 and how is that accomplished
 this is a very complex set of variables to coordinate doctor
 i will thank you doctor
 computer create dance partner female begin music
 commander rikers easy going manner and sense of humour is fascinating to me i believe it to be one reason he is so popular among the crew it may also be partly responsible for his success in matters of love there may be a correlation between humour and sex the need for more research is clearly indicated
 commander
 sir we have reached the designated coordinates
 captain i am detecting a ship in the neutral zone configuration romulan warbird
 engaging computer override
 captain there is no prior record of this type of accident occurring aboard a starship backup systems and safeguards are designed to prevent just such an occurrence
 aye sir
 captain picard was the person who first interested me in the works of sir arthur conan doyle i have subsequently become a great admirer of the fictional detective sherlock holmes and his ability to solve mysteries by careful examination of the available evidence
 i have found holmes methodology of deductive reasoning to be quite useful one of his adages is that once you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth
 that is not my purpose i would like to examine the remains of ambassador tpel left on the transporter pad
 have you compared the genetic code with the ambassadors last recorded transporter id traces
 i could be chasing an untamed ornithoid without a cause
 can you postulate an explanation for the discrepancy
 a supposition not supported by the transporter records
 the only abnormality found during my investigation was a temporary increase in the matter to energy signal ratio due to the circumstances i decided to investigate the possibility that a second transporter signal had caused the fluctuation although this was highly improbable it was the only remaining theory
 from the devoras
 while simultaneously a small amount of genetically similar material was left in the ambassadors place
 yes sir
 the safest and most logical decision in this situation is to contact starfleet and await further instructions however based on past experience i project only a seventeen percent chance captain picard will choose that alternative
 the devoras is dropping out of warp sir their weapon systems are powering up
 aye sir
 in the game of poker there is a moment when a player must decide if an opponent is being deceptive or actually holds a winning hand this decision is based not only on the odds but also on an appraisal of the man is he bluffing or does he have the cards
 keiko i need your help i have offended you and need to find a way to rectify my mistake i am not sure what to do
 i should not have interfered it would be best if i apologised
 but
 i am not nervous i am confused
 there are still many human emotions i do not fully comprehend anger hatred revenge but i am not mystified by the desire to be loved or the need for friendship these are things i do understand
 i was looking for doctor crusher
 the juarez child
 very well i have the bridge
 if being human is not simply a matter of being born flesh and blood if it is instead a way of thinking acting and feeling then i am hopeful that one day i will discover my own humanity

 accessing chief obrien served under his command aboard the rutledge sir
 captain the phoenix in sector twenty one five oh five
 it appears it be a cardassian supply ship
 sir the cardassian warship is moving on the phoenix
 the warship is three hundred thousand kilometres from the phoenix it is opening fire the phoenix has taken a direct hit the phoenix is beginning evasive manoeuvres it has positioned itself outside the weapons range of the opposing ship the phoenix has powered up both phasers and photon torpedoes the phoenix is firing photon torpedoes
 sir the phoenix is firing on the

 we have located the phoenix sir we will intercept it in twenty two minutes
 at our present speed three hours twenty minutes sir
 captain the phoenix has changed course
 sir the phoenix is heading directly for a cardassian vessel point one two light years from our location
 captain the phoenix has accelerated to warp nine we will not be able to reach him before he intercepts the cardassian ship
 sir the phoenix has dropped out of warp they have reached the cardassian vessel
 negative sir their phaser banks are not armed
 our sensors are unable to determine status of the cardassian defensive systems their ship is running with a high powered subspace field
 captain the phoenix is transferring power to its shields
 i dont
 i dont know
 because a little thing affects them a slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats you may be an undigested bit of beef a blot of mustard a crumb of cheese a fragment of an underdone potato why theres more of gravy than of grave about you whatever you are humbug i tell you humbug
 your courtesy is appreciated sir but i am aware that i do not effectively convey the fear called for in this scene
 sir that is not an appropriate basis for an effective performance not by the standards set by my mentors
 yes sir i have studied the philosophies of virtually every known acting master i find myself attracted to stanislavsky adler garnav proponents of an acting technique known as the method
 perhaps because the technique requires an actor to seek his own emotional awareness to understand the character he plays
 sir i have modified the method for my own uses since i have no emotional awareness to create a performance i am attempting to use performance to create emotional awareness i believe if i can learn to duplicate the fear of ebenezer scrooge i will be one step closer to truly understanding humanity
 she is a cornerstone of ventaxian theology it seems that ardra came to ventax two and promised one thousand years of peace and prosperity for a price upon her return she would enslave the entire population in ventaxian culture it is considered bad luck to speak her name out loud clark there are ancient scrolls concerning ardra that are stored in the athenaeum vaults scholars study them they have been of little public interest until recently
 we have scanned the tectonic stress patterns of your planets crust there is no evidence that the quakes pose any kind of threat
 so you do purport to be the mythic figure ardra
 i have sir
 the contract agrees to deliver the people of ventax two into the personal servitude of ardra after one thousand years of peace i have compared the terms to the body of laws which govern the planet the language of the agreement is correct in every detail sir
 i am an android
 im afraid the contract could be interpreted in that way sir
 you wished to see me sir
 barnum sir pt
 sir do you believe ardra is to use the vernacular a con artist
 sir i must point out that the ventaxians did have one thousand years of peace and tranquility as promised by ardra
 indeed sir in the story the spirits used fear to motivate scrooge to reform his character
 sir the language of the contract seems carefully chosen to avoid any loopholes
 aye sir
 sir i believe i have found an obscure precedent in ventaxian law which may be of interest
 the case involves a contract dispute over services rendered by a klingon craftsman on the construction of a ventaxian home because the dispute involved an alien culture the parties decided that arbitration rather than the courts should resolve the issue both sides agreed to choose an arbiter it is the only known case involving an alien claimant
 shuttlecraft one to enterprise prepare for docking sequence
 i cannot locate the enterprise anywhere within one light year of the planet sir
 ardra before he responds may i have a word in private with captain picard
 sir i request you reject me as arbitrator
 ardra is right if i am chosen i will perform my duties without bias or sentiment i cannot guarantee i will deliver a verdict in your favour
 sir i will have to follow the rules of conduct for a ventaxian jurist
 captain picard my interpretation of ventaxian law suggests under these circumstances this is acceptable your objection is overruled
 sir i have ruled please sit down you may proceed
 i find no cause to invalidate the contract at this time the arbitration will continue
 it is highly irregular to question the opposing advocate but i see no reason to deny it proceed
 sustained the advocate will refrain from expressing personal affections for her opponent
 you are out of order
 the advocate will refrain from making her opponent disappear
 any more disruptions and i will rule you in contempt of court is that understood
 sustained i will draw my own conclusions if you do not mind sir
 rebuttal
 captain picard do you have any further evidence to present before i render judgment
 geordi one hour recess is granted
 i think he deserves some leeway overruled but that will be quite enough captain
 your leeway has run out captain
 with the advocates withdrawal the contract is hereby dissolved this arbitration is adjourned
 congratulations sir
 captain lieutenant commander data here please excuse the unusual interruption but under the circumstances i thought that patching communications through the holodeck programme would be less obtrusive
 long range sensors detect a ttauri type star within a pocket of the ngame cloud
 no sir however the stars single planet falls within the mclass range it is capable of supporting life
 highly sir
 aye sir
 sensors indicate an energy fluctuation directly in our path source unknown
 very likely small and extremely unstable wormholes have been mapped near thirty nine ttauri systems in the last one hundred years alone sir
 captain
 captain
 careful captain the stun effect from the wormhole was relatively severe
 approximately thirty seconds i have scanned the entire ship and detected no lifethreatening injuries among the crew
 no sir my positronic system is immune to the effect this is the third unstable wormhole i have passed through during my time with starfleet the first was aboard the uss trieste
 sir i should realign the ships clock with starbase four tens subspace signal to adjust for the time distortion
 yes captain
 that was never actually a possibility the wormholes small size and relatively short period would make this a local phenomenon
 the unpredictability of the wormhole would make an investigation a hazardous one a probe launched from our current position would be more advisable
 coming in now sir the probe is within visual range of the planet
 sensors indicate a hydrogenhelium composition with a frozen helium core
 it is possible the sensors were affected by interference from the wormhole commander it is clearly not a class m planet
 aye sir
 it is conceivable that the sensors picked up the afterimage of an actual planet on the other side of the wormhole we could survey the nearby stars for such a planet it would require approximately six days sir
 captain i have a hypothesis the twentysecond century physicist pell underhill conjectured that a major disruption in time continuity could be compensated for by trillions of counter reactions that effect may have allowed doctor crushers mosses to arrive at the other side of the worm hole with the unanticipated growth
 true nevertheless it is possible that the phenomenon could occur in matter at much higher levels of organisation given the proper conditions
 as you wish captain
 the long range and infrared sensors apparently suffered ill effects as a result of the wormhole we are presently checking neutrino and heavy particle detectors
 it is a mystery captain
 i am unable to answer that question sir
 as you wish captain
 i know the way sir
 have you forgotten geordi that my sensory inputs are not programmed to experience pain
 i am perfectly comfortable
 i have noticed however that you appear a bit uncomfortable yourself
 i cannot tell you anything beyond what i have already stated
 yes sir it is the planet our probe detected in the ttauri system
 i cannot verify that hypothesis
 no sir
 is she all right sir
 no sir i cannot
 it is not by choice
 i cannot say
 which would you place first the welfare of a single individual or that of the entire crew
 i am not saying that at all i merely state a possible alternative explanation
 i cannot answer that
 i am apparently guilty of falsifying the enterprises records of interfering with an investigation of disobeying a direct order from my commanding officer your duty seems clear sir
 i realise that sir
 yes sir i do
 counsellor troi what is it
 you have returned
 i was unable to prevent it
 the enterprise is not a threat to you give me more time our destruction would only
 one moment if you would
 do nothing it may yet be possible to salvage the situation
 reporting as ordered captain
 we must leave immediately sir
 any further delay would put us all at grave risk
 i cannot say
 my silence is not by choice sir
 geordis examination was exemplary
 i cannot answer that we must leave sir
 you did sir
 no we must vary shield shape and strength as rapidly as possible maximum shields will only speed the ships takeover
 the energy field will eventually penetrate our shields there is no way to counter the paxans technology we can delay their takeover but we cannot prevent it
 you will only harm counsellor trois body
 they are xenophobes sir isolationists the paxans terraformed a protoplanet in this system in order to better conceal their whereabouts the apparent wormhole we experienced is actually a trap designed to keep out invaders the energy field stuns everyone on board the invading vessel and places them in a state of biochemical stasis
 the paxans then take the ship out of their territory
 precisely
 my positronic brain is a technology unknown to the paxans
 when i realised the crew was incapacitated i initiated emergency procedures
 computer engage emergency plan zed zed alpha
 computer begin random fluctuation of shield frequency and modulation
 with the enterprise temporarily protected i revived the crew
 computer release compound adth into the airflow system five parts per million
 the energy field is attempting to match shield frequencies sir
 negative sir the field is also acting as a tractor beam
 the paxans can manipulate energy structures on many levels they took control of counsellor trois body to communicate with us
 as a starfleet officer i am required to follow all of your orders captain
 completely sir
 we proceeded to erase all evidence of our encounter with the paxans i reset the computers chronometer and the crew was again stunned into unconsciousness their shortterm memories erased when they were revived a day later the computer adjustments made it appear that only thirty seconds had passed
 the effect from the wormhole was rather intense
 everyone but myself was rendered unconscious my positronic system is immune to the effect
 thirty seconds sir
 yes sir the wormhole appears to have been a local phenomenon
 sir it is likely the anomalous readings were the result of the wormholes effect it was extremely unstable i would recommend against returning it might put the enterprise at further risk
 that would certainly be sufficient sir
 chancellor minister
 in a manner of speaking the term artificial lifeform would be more accurate
 no minister he has not returned to our designated transport coordinates we have continued to scan the capital city without success
 commander i am picking up some unusual readings from the alpha omicron system at this range all i am able to discern is that it is an asymmetrical field of intense energy
 unknown sir the alpha omicron system is yet to be charted i recommend we take this opportunity for further research
 the anomaly is orbiting the seventh planet sir it is a mass of plasma energy contained within discrete boundaries by an outer covering of silicates actinides and carbonaceous chondrites
 none sir this has never been seen before
 sensors are having difficulty penetrating the interior however the radiated output suggests a coherent system of energy storage and utilisation
 it is a possibility however the sensor data gathered thus far suggests a naturally occurring phenomenon with biological properties
 yes captain
 levelfive probe sequence ready for launch commander on your mark
 aye sir picard what would it be like counsellor no ship no bulky spacesuit just to live between the stars have the entire galaxy as a home
 change in readings sir the life form has increased its energy output by fifty percent
 we are caught in an energy damping field sir
 no change in position
 radiation levels dropping back to normal captain energy patterns are breaking down sir the radiation signature is no longer stable
 energy output is negligible sir radiation patterns no longer coherent i believe it is dead sir
 captain sensors are picking up a new energy reading from the life form
 there is a new concentration of ionising radiation growing in the centre of its body
 this new concentration of energy was detected only after the surrounding material became inert
 the radiation signature is similar to the original pattern but with significant differences
 i believe it is separate and selfcontained within the body of the dead life form
 yes sir it appears to be a smaller less developed version of the original creature
 the first incision is complete
 the life forms patterns are stable captain it seems able to withstand the solar radiation
 a change in energy readings sir i am reading an internal buildup of gamma particles in
 the creature is now in direct contact with the hull sir
 sir the life form is draining energy directly from the fusion reactors
 i can attempt to extrapolate from the heading it was on when we encountered it sir
 sir is the appellation junior to be the life forms official name
 captain i have completed the analysis of the parents course through this system
 the asteroids contain large quantities of meklonite which is interfering with our scanners i am also detecting traces of kephneum a compound found in the outer shell of the parent being it is likely the asteroids provide sustenance for this lifeform sir
 captain the offspring is emitting high frequency radio transmissions
 i am detecting other radio transmissions captain
 at their current speed sir the entities will intercept us in ten minutes thirty one seconds
 negative i detect no reduction in the life forms rate of energy consumption
 the lifeform is emitting its high frequency transmission energy consumption is rising sir
 auxiliary generators losing power captain
 the entity has disengaged sir power levels are returning to normal captain
 the ship is intact sir with no indication of structural damage
 all propulsion systems are shut down the ship is drifting sir
 inconclusive
 there is no malfunction in any of the main systems sir
 matter valves are open and operating magnetic containment of antimatter pods is constant
 injectors open there is no engine activity at all sir
 is there a problem ensign
 ready now captain
 captain thrusters are losing power
 no sir apparently we do not
 after analysing the sensor logs of the brittain and the enterprise as well as the data from the last series of probes i conclude that we have become trapped in a massive rupture in space into which energy is absorbed
 a rare anomaly named after bela tyken the melthusian captain who first encountered it
 the ships energy is being drained into the fissure before we can utilise it
 when tyken was trapped in the rift his analysis determined that a massive energy release might overload and dislocate the anomaly fortunately his cargo included anicium and yurium which he used to detonate the explosion he then escaped through the ruptured centre of the rift
 no sir we no longer have the power to reproduce complex elements in the replicator we must find a way to generate a violent energy release without using conventional means
 no there were no reports of unusual conduct among the crew
 there were no records of sleep disturbances of any kind counsellor
 commander la forge and i have come up with a potential solution to our predicament perhaps the modifications used to increase firepower against the borg could be effective here
 yes sir i believe that within six hours we could generate a concentrated burst of energy which might disrupt the tykens rift
 yes sir
 yes sir
 i will do my best sir
 the brittain doctor
 i believe the doctor means is that humans enter what is known as rem sleep rapid eye movement it is the level of brain wave activity at which one dreams
 the main deflector dish
 data to bridge mister worf activate the deflector
 captain it appears the energy output
 has been absorbed into the rift
 no sir if we draw
 more power we risk losing life support systems
 it is possible that this telepathic communication is creating interference in the rem sleep of other species that would explain why the rest of our crew is not dreaming
 your hypothesis is certainly plausible there may be another ship on the other side of the fissure where we cannot detect it
 there is no technology to block telepathic transmissions doctor
 perhaps we can accomplish more than that if there is another ship and we can reach them we might be able to coordinate our efforts to free ourselves
 working together with the aliens we must discover a means by which we an produce an explosion more intense than either one of us could achieve alone
 these are the elements we have available some of them could be used in the creation of an explosive reaction if we could communicate this inventory to the other ship perhaps they would be able to
 i am uncertain if a simple transmission will be adequate
 yes counsellor one electron circles one proton this is a hydrogen atom
 perhaps the aliens are thinking as we are to collaborate in producing an explosion if hydrogen is combined with another element calendenium for example it is extremely volatile but would the message mean they have hydrogen or they want hydrogen
 then the proper course of action would be to release hydrogen into the rift and hope that they have a substance that will detonate it
 if you are correct counsellor i believe they have already told us what to do and are waiting for us to do it when we are ready the only message you should attempt to convey is now
 counsellor
 you will have to communicate with the other ship within two minutes of entering rem sleep
 unfortunately yes
 we have only enough power to emit a hydrogen stream for that amount of time they must understand that they will have to detonate it immediately captain we are ready to implement the plan
 we will have to draw power from the lifesupport systems in order to discharge the collectors this is acting captain data all personnel will report to designated shelter areas
 immediately life support systems will continue only in emergency shelter areas
 thank you doctor activating bussard collectors
 ninety seconds remaining
 forty five seconds remaining
 thirty seconds remaining
 ten seconds remaining
 the counsellor was unsuccessful
 engines activated sir
 we have cleared the rift sir warp engines are coming back online
 setting a course for starbase two twenty sir as my final duty as acting captain i order you to bed i shall do the same for all personnel
 pleasant dreams sir
 the shuttles acceleration is increasing its trajectory is moving directly into the planets atmosphere he will reach an atmospheric interface at an altitude of two hundred and ten kilometres
 that is correct commander
 fifty three seconds sir
 the shuttle is approaching the outer thermosphere captain
 at current rate of acceleration the shuttle will be destroyed in twenty eight seconds
 sixteen seconds to impact
 the shuttles entering the lower ionosphere sir
 no life signs commander
 during microscopic examination of the torn uniform i discovered these alien skin cells
 undetermined
 fortunately we have more evidence we were able to determine that these footprints found near the shuttle were not made by any known tarchannen life form
 the planet is subject to frequent sandstorms footprints might have been obliterated prior to your arrival doctor crusher and i will begin to search the medical database in an attempt to match these with some known life form
 i am aware of that doctor however i can see no other reasonable course of investigation available to us and we may not have much time
 i am an android it is not possible
 starfleet personnel have vanished others may be at risk we must do the best we can to find out why however i am strongly motivated to solve this mystery
 geordi may i inquire how your investigation is proceeding
 have you attempted an audio analysis
 there is no need for an apology perhaps if you indulged in a brief rest period you would be able to approach this problem with a fresh point of view
 may i can assist you
 negative commander nothing in our survey suggests the source of a parasitic infection
 i am showing no transporter activity
 captain the security lockout on transporter room six has been broken
 i cannot sir the transporter cycle has already begun
 captain if we can get close enough to geordi we can read his absorption spectrum with an ultraviolet light
 yes sir
 i must replace the emitter module and reconnect the power supply it will take approximately two minutes to complete the modification sir
 i have completed modifications commander
 lieutenant barclays performance was adequate but clearly not rooted in the method approach i do not understand why
 the fusion reactors that power the array are extremely unstable there is a high risk of overload
 they do not seem to be functioning at all sir
 no sir power emissions do not match any known radiation patterns we have not encountered this technology before sir
 captain sensors are reading no particulate emissions or subspace field distortions
 method of propulsion is unknown sir
 captain an energy field is forming around the device intensity is three point two terawatts and increasing
 the probes field intensity is continuing to build sir we are in danger
 captain the probes energy output is overloading our shields failure anticipated in forty seven seconds
 a standard isolation procedure would be advisable
 an interesting suggestion lieutenant however that approach would require much more time than our original plan at least seven weeks
 reactor nine will reach critical in ten minutes forty three seconds the subsequent explosion will create a chain reaction along the entire length of the array sir
 argus reactor nine twenty eight seconds to critical
 twelve seconds to critical
 captain the argus reactors are shutting down we are no longer in danger sir
 unknown sir
 lieutenant barclay has not yet extended himself into the engineering subsystems it may be possible to establish an odn bypass directly to the bridge
 this disturbance is the result of a highly charged graviton field emanating from our warp nacelles it is creating a severe bias in the subspace continuum
 i have been monitoring geordis progress it will be operational in seventeen minutes
 captain we have not regained control of the propulsion systems the odn bypass to the bridge has been blocked
 we are experiencing a quantummodel oscillation delay doubling in intensity every twelve point three seconds biocellular disruption is imminent
 captain all systems are back under helm control the computer has returned to normal functioning
 how do you do
 on the contrary lieutenant worf your clothing identifies you with the character of will scarlett just as geordis mandolin identifies him as alan adale
 perhaps you are referring to the rescue of maid marian from nottingham castle
 the arrow impacted just above my sixth intercostal support penetrating my secondary subprocessor fortunately none of my biofunctions seem affected do not be concerned counsellor i believe your aim is improving
 at the rate the levels are decreasing we will gain entry in forty nine hours captain
 slow motion study of the explosion suggests that the articulation frame collapsed
 other evidence lends credence to that theory captain a review of the sensor logs indicates that every systems reading was well within normal parameters until fifty two milliseconds before the explosion
 we have made microtomographic analyses of the dilithium chamber the hatch mounting the blast pattern from the explosion
 those fractures suggest nothing more than simple neutron fatigue i would speculate that when the engine was last inspected at mckinley station the hatch casing was replaced with one which had an undetectable defect i believe sir that the conclusion to our investigation must be that the explosion was not intentional
 captain warp engines are back online we are ready to commence restart sequences sir
 the modifications that you have made to the torpedos guidance systems are remarkable doctor
 it is true that the intellectual efficiency of high order beings does diminish proportionately with the deprivation of nutritious fuel or
 tracking torpedoes entry programme confirmed
 pressure wave harmonics dispersing temperature in target zone increasing to eighty one million degrees sir
 radiation and pressure levels still stable
 turbulence patterns are within predicted parameters
 temperature is rising in the core again captain two hundred and thirty million degrees kelvin
 rate exceeding critical level core density is becoming unstable
 the people of kaelon two are isolationists almost to the point of being xenophobes regrettably we know very little about their customs
 there was a evidence of a delayed surface shock
 perhaps doctor but there is no known method for controlling a neutron migration
 they refuse to accept further reports from you doctor
 ambassador odan doctor crusher i was just on my way to speak to you
 i have completed my study on the atmospheric variations which have occurred on the moon since the new technology was implemented
 i could go over it with you now it would not require more than two hours
 then it is perfect timing doctor what better occasion to integrate my results into your study
 at least an hour but i do not believe much time can be saved by exhibiting such haste now
 i hope doctor crusher was able to help you with your headache
 my design models suggest that beta will eventually experience rising temperatures erratic tide surges and in general the beginnings of global warming
 initiate shuttle preflight sequence
 shuttle has cleared the bay door
 would it be possible for me to serve as a temporary carrier
 sir it could take more than two hours to reach the vessel
 welcome back geordi
 how was the seminar
 it is fortunate we were able to coordinate your return on the teldarian cruiser
 i am sorry to hear you did not enjoy yourself
 joking ah forced to endure risa your actual intent was to emphasise that you did enjoy yourself yes i see how that could be considered quite amusing
 commander riker
 our sensors have detected a brief energy fluctuation in the eband
 unknown sir eband emissions are difficult to localise
 yes sir however there are no protostars in this sector
 yes sir
 energy flow is within normal parameters from the prefire chamber to the emission aperture
 energy cell usage remains constant at one point oh five megajoules per second curious the efficiency reading on the discharge crystal is well above starfleet specifications
 our most efficient discharge crystal typically fires with eighty six point five percent efficiency
 pulse frequency out of prefire chamber reads steady
 that might suggest that the weapon has been charged with a forced pulse well into the terahertz range
 three hundred twenty seven to our knowledge we can probably achieve an exact match with a random computer search it will take approximately three hours
 yes sir however the difference in intensity indicates that this one did not originate from the same location as the first
 that is a reasonable assumption
 not to my knowledge sir
 we can reconfigure the primary sensor array if we narrow their focus to scan for eband emissions we might be able to calculate a directional vector but only if there are more occurrences
 sensors confirm an unauthorised transporter beam at eleven twenty three hours
 the primary plasma system does not indicate a power drain from any of the transporters
 tracking power from secondary systems no surges to any of the transporters indicated
 no abnormal surges indicated
 cargo bay four
 perhaps the perpetrator reprogrammed the memory chips to erase any record
 i was on the bridge at my station
 the erasures were complete however an analysis of the subatomic structure revealed an almost undetectable residual pattern in time we may be able to reconstruct the perpetrators authorisation code
 yes commander
 acknowledged i will be there shortly
 we have been picking up a curious intermittent blip commander riker has speculated that it may be a romulan transmission i am attempting to track its source
 the first and third eband blips were clearly generated on board the ship the second came from the planet surface
 unknown sir
 one could speculate that the eband is being used for some form of covert communication
 yes sir computer run an analysis of all known romulan transmission formats all bands identify any commonalities with displayed waveform
 does this waveform match that of any known communication format
 broaden search pattern beyond communications does the waveform displayed conform to any natural phenomena cryptographic formats or lifeform em emissions
 as in a human brainwave pattern
 what kind of receiver would be capable of processing these signals
 computer link with the shuttles onboard system access the isolinear storage assembly scan all chips which contain mission logs note any discrepancies
 perform a level  diagnostic on the shuttles power and navigational systems
 computer scan the shuttles structural integrity
 probable cause of these variations
 computer i am reading anomalous variations in the molecular structure of these memory chips please confirm
 probable cause
 compare these variations with established romulan replication patterns
 data to la forge
 report please geordi
 please respond
 computer current location of commander la forge
 data to lieutenant worf
 priority one
 take commander la forge into custody immediately
 that is an order
 i believe i can help captain i have been able to determine that commander la forge was abducted by romulans en route to risa it is likely that he was somehow forced to take part in the plot to assassinate governor vagh
 no sir you did not i do not believe the commander is acting of his own accord he has been receiving eband signals through his visor signals which are carrying direct commands to his brain i have surmised that commander la forge was conditioned by romulans a process referred to historically and somewhat inaccurately as brainwashing
 no sir that is not possible the signals had to be transmitted within close proximity to the visor
 yes sir i am
 i have narrowed the list of possibilities to two people the only two people who were with commander la forge all three times a transmission was recorded captain picard and ambassador kell one of them may be concealing an eband transmitter if they would agree to be searched
 aye sir
 do you also require the original logs recorded during the attack lieutenant
 we can provide you with our analysis of the communications between the khitomer outpost and the romulan ships however for a complete record you will have to contact starbase twenty four
 a second ship has joined the attack on the bortas
 the bortas has lost her port shields sir it is unlikely they will withstand another hit at that quarter their primary life support has failed sir
 aye sir
 may i ask a question sir of a personal nature
 i am confused why have i not been assigned to command a ship in the fleet sir
 you have commented on the lack of senior officers available for this mission i believe my twenty six years of starfleet service qualifies me for such a post however if you do not believe the time has arrived for an android to command a starship perhaps i should address myself to improving my
 thank you sir
 i am lieutenant commander data
 by order of starfleet i hereby take command of this vessel please note the time and date in the ships log
 may i ask why
 your service record to date suggests that you would perform that function adequately
 why
 i understand your concerns request denied
 all stop notify the flagship that we have assumed station
 why are the backups not functioning
 you have taken the phaser and torpedo control units offline
 mister hobson it is inappropriate for you to determine a course of action without consulting the commanding officer
 you will take the phasers and torpedo units offline and begin repairs of the starboard power coupling
 data here sir
 yes sir the romulans have released a high energy burst the net is no longer effective in a radius of ten million kilometres around the sutherland
 acknowledge the signal ensign lay in the course and engage at warp nine point three
 in disrupting the detection net the romulans may have caused a residual tachyon signature to form around their own ships
 all stop
 the tachyon signatures will not last long by the time the fleet is deployed it will be too late begin to reconfigure the sensors to detect ionised particle traces
 i am aware of the difficulties please bring the phasers back online
 we will initiate radiation protocol when necessary
 mister hobson you will carry out my orders or i will relieve you of duty
 display sensor schematic display sensor sweep maximum range
 overlay display with tachyon emissions highlight any tachyon signatures which show subspace inertial displacement concentrate a sensor sweep in that area
 reconfigure photon torpedo warhead yields set for high energy burst level six
 do it
 stand by captain mister hobson prepare to fire
 fire fire
 make a full report to the flagship take the main phasers offline and begin radiation clean up on the affected decks
 captain i wish to submit myself for disciplinary action i have disobeyed a direct order from a superior officer although the result of my actions proved positive the ends cannot justify the means
 sir
 the signal is a standard mathematical progression it does not carry a specific message
 federation vessels have encountered tamarian ships seven times over the past one hundred years each meeting went without incident however formal relations were not established because communication was not possible
 the children of tama were called incomprehensible by captain silvestri of the shiku maru other accounts were comparable
 the tamarian seems to be stating the proper names of individuals and locations
 i am at a loss sir
 the tamarians have transported captain picard to the planet surface along with their own captain
 it will not be possible to transport sir the tamarian ship has created a particle scattering field on the planets ionosphere
 no sir the tamarians are projecting a particle sustaining beam into the upper atmosphere the result is a hyperionisation that virtually disrupts all em and subspace carriers
 that is correct however they have left sensor frequencies clear
 sensors show captain picard and the tamarian in apparent good health approximately twenty metres from each other
 not without further study
 sir the tamarians are fully capable of stopping a shuttle
 commander the shuttle has reached the e region of the planets ionosphere
 the scattering layer induced by the tamarians is concentrated in the upper d region the shuttle will reach that area in approximately two minutes
 unchanged sir they appear to be making no attempt to stop us
 commander i am reading a power surge in the tamarian plasma reactor
 commander the shuttle has been hit
 the starboard nacelle has been rendered inoperable
 yes sir the phaser pulse appears to have been carefully attenuated for just that effect
 as i have said with further study it may be possible
 freeze darmok
 the apparent emotional dynamic does seem to support that assumption as with the other terms used by the tamarian this appears to be a proper noun the name clearly carries a meaning for them
 i have encountered one thousand seven hundred fifty four nonhuman races during my tenure with starfleet
 correct
 replay at time index one four four
 freeze computer search for the term tanagra all databases
 the tamarian ego structure does not seem to allow what we normally think of as selfidentity their ability to abstract is highly unusual they seem to communicate through narrative imagery by reference to the individuals and places which appear in their mythohistorical accounts
 no sir the situation is analogous to understanding the grammar of a language but none of the vocabulary
 it is necessary for us to learn the narrative from which the tamarians drawing their imagery given our current relations that does not appear likely
 commander the tamarians bioscan is becoming unreadable he may be dead sir
 sir sensors are tracking the entity it is approaching captain picards position
 nine metres and closing the energy output of the entity has doubled commander six metres
 scattering field is down sir
 that may not be possible sir the starboard nacelle sustained a direct hit warp engines are offline
 commander we cannot survive another hit
 power has been restored sir
 twenty six minutes captain
 there are dozens of bajoran camps on the three classm planets i suggest we may want to begin on valo three where an adhoc leader named jas holza lives the federation has had several dealings with him
 sir
 ensign whom do you suggest we speak to
 aye sir
 computer locate ensign ro
 i am picking up molecular displacement traces that suggests movement through this area during the last ten hours
 data to picard data to worf
 perhaps someone wanted to draw us into the conflict
 aye sir
 i am monitoring increased activity inside cardassian space two ships are moving along the border heading one four two mark zero five one
 they are moving into a course parallel to our own captain
 the cardassian ships are changing course sir they are crossing the border
 subspace signal coming from starfleet captain admiral kennelly
 it is on a secure channel sir in your ready room
 i do not recognise the sound i believe it is coming from above
 subterranean caverns to the east sir doctor
 the refractory metal in the rock formations may act as an effective barrier
 commander the refractory metals in the rock strata may also interfere with communication
 i am not entirely certain they will sir
 it has been over an hour since we heard the entity sir it may be gone
 doctor i ran a full spectrographic analysis section by section trace elements confirm that it is the same entity which destroyed the colony at omicron theta
 doctor the cave in which we hid was made of rock which contained heavy concentrations of kelbonite and fistrium we surmise that the entity was unable to penetrate that barrier
 yes sir
 doctor there is evidence of residual bitrious matter in the soil it was not present before the entitys attack
 doctor doctor marr you have made it clear that my presence disturbs you however i do not see how we can achieve our task if you continue to ignore me
 then i do not understand your lack of interest in the bitrious filament i mentioned
 as i have speculated the presence of refractory metals
 were those caves laced with kelbonite or fistrium
 then perhaps the combination of the two metals prevented the entity from
 i do not understand
 i cannot see what effect my being here would have had
 do you believe that i lured the entity here
 no doctor because lore betrayed the colonists on omicron theta you believe that i am capable of the same behaviour you are mistaken doctor my programming is distinctly different from lores
 i do understand and i am attempting to explain to you it is impossible
 that is true doctor
 yes doctor
 were you expecting a different result this time doctor
 doctor have you ever scanned your samples for gamma radiation
 we are seeing high energy reactions that may show up in a gamma scan
 if the entity left a residual trace of antiproton in the samples we collected a gamma radiation scan would reveal that
 if we try a logarithmic scale we will have better resolution
 yes doctor
 the thanks actually go to doctor clendenning on omicron theta who did the first experiments with gamma scans
 that is correct but i possess much of his knowledge he was working on new detectors at the time of the attack on omicron theta
 it is true doctor the contents of their logs and journals were transferred into my memory cells the man who created me also experimented with scanning the synaptic patterns of the colonists temporal lobes and programming them into my neural nets
 to some degree doctor soong hoped to provide me with an amalgam of the colonists memories
 yes sir there are two possible destinations the brechtian cluster and the argos system
 yes sir the brechtian cluster has two inhabited planets
 come in
 not at all doctor
 that is very gracious of you to say doctor but i have not been injured by you
 that is true i have experimented with producing vibrations in crystals by means of graviton pulses
 exactly i will call up the results i have achieved this far for you to study
 i do not possess the minute to minute remembrances of each person although the more intense recollections are contained in my memory banks
 marr raymond called renny yes i do
 yes
 blame you
 there are no records of any blame against you
 there are no records of any negative thoughts about you his personal journals indicated that he was proud that you were such a fine scientist
 the crystalline entity is moving away sir
 warp and impulse engines are down sir but they can be restarted a skeleton crew could take the ship to a starbase
 aye sir
 deck seventeen doctor you have seemed preoccupied since we surveyed the kallisko
 not at all
 we should programme the bridge science station to vary the emissions we direct toward the entity
 that is correct doctor
 i have some vivid memories of sporting events he played parrises squares with a group of his schoolmates
 yes he was pleased to have won a championship emblem
 yes doctor your sons most intense memories revolve around a young woman named jenina
 he enjoyed her kindness her gentleness her physical attributes
 yes doctor
 i would be happy to be of help
 that is true doctor but what would you want me to say
 many of his journal entries took the form of letters to friends and family i could access one of those
 as renny i took my last exam today i think i did all right on everything except cellular biology i know you think its important mom but i dont see how im ever going to use this stuff in a couple of weeks a bunch of us are going on an archaeological dig in the mountains the wallaces said it would be all right as long as we had adult supervision so dont worry theyre looking out for me theyre really great people and i like them a lot but theyre kind of serious they dont have your sense of humour mom mom i miss you
 yes commander but sensors have not yet locked onto its exact whereabouts
 commencing graviton emissions now
 emissions now at ten pulses per second
 doctor marr do you wish to change the frequency doctor marr
 changing to twenty pulses per second
 emissions now at thirty pulses per second
 captain there is a pattern emerging from the signals
 i believe so sir but it will take some time to decipher the patterns
 doctor doctor marr doctor marr we must return to the intermittent signal
 sir the entity is beginning to resonate vibrations are increasing
 i cannot stop our graviton signal captain doctor marr has isolated the access code
 the amplitude is still rising captain resonance is approaching critical
 perhaps i should escort the doctor sir
 please come with me doctor
 i will stay with you doctor
 there has been no predetermined limit placed on my existence doctor
 in what way doctor
 i do not find such a file in your sons journals however from what i know of him by his memories and his writing i do not believe he would be happy he was proud of your career as a scientist and now you have destroyed that you say you did it for him but i do not believe he would have wanted that yes i believe your son would be very sad now i am sorry doctor but i cannot help you
 may i
 i have surveyed all the turbolifts and service crawlways on this deck access to the bridge has been completely severed by emergency bulkheads
 heavy damage to section twenty three a has cut off access to sickbay i have ordered a security team to bring casualties here until further notice
 in that circumstance reestablishing control should be our top priority
 yes sir the most direct route is blocked but i believe we can use a starboard service crawlway
 that is correct sir we have approximately fifty two metres remaining in this crawlway before we can safely exit into a main corridor
 commander the current cannot be off down from this relay box
 if the energy flowing through that arc were interrupted by a nonconductive material it is likely the circuit would be broken
 commander much of my bodyframe is made up of tripolymers a non conductive material
 yes sir
 the power surge would cause a system failure in my internal processors and melt my primary power couplings however there is a chance that the damage would not be irreparable
 commander our options are very limited
 my positronic brain has several layers of shielding to protect me from power surges it would be possible for you to remove my cranial unit and take it with you
 yes sir is something wrong sir
 my memory core and neural nets are selfcontained i would be fine sir
 a remarkable experience commander
 apparently so sir my neural nets are still fully operational you may begin by opening the ventral access panel located two centimetres beneath my right ear
 very good commander you have established a connection i can now raise the door
 the power reaching those monitors has been diverted from the bridge sir
 no sir i do not have access to the containment field you will have to establish a new link locate the odn conduit sir
 yes sir you must now change the input matrix in my secondary optical port and then connect the odn conduit
 that is not the correct port sir
 you must hurry commander the containment field has dropped to sixteen percent
 the field continues to drop sir collapse is imminent
 i have a connection sir i am now stabilising the containment field
 commander starfleet has added a diplomatic mission to oceanus four
 wesley was our attempt to make you uncomfortable effective
 did you find our deception pleasing
 have you found the academy challenging wesley
 although i did extremely well scholastically my lack of human understanding often created social obstacles
 i particularly remember the phenomenon of practical jokes several of which i fell victim to
 good for you
 i also found social gatherings difficult there was one event an academy tradition the sadie hawkins dance
 a notably awkward experience
 really your mother is quite an expert she recently taught me
 i would be happy to teach you dancing i have programmed a comprehensive seventeen part course with some interesting holographic partners
 geordi a conflict has started between the planetary evolution team and the stellar physicists each wishes to be the first to use the thermal imaging array
 a coin very good i will replicate one immediately
 data here
 yes doctor on my way
 you wanted to see me doctor
 certainly
 it does not bother me in fact i am happy to
 computer resume normal illumination
 mister worf you will find a small alien ship off the starboard bow please secure it with a tractor beam and raise our shields
 are you all right captain
 wesleys subsequent diversions gave me adequate time to modify the palm beacon the optical burst patterns we programmed were successful in counteracting the addictive effects of the game
 we programmed the main computer to transmit the same optical burst to all display screens work stations and terminals throughout the ship
 aye sir
 captain picard regrets detaining you but it will be necessary for a while longer in addition i require access to your ships computer
 i am going to attempt to penetrate the romulan central information net
 i have unique skills that may allow me to succeed
 your entry codes can be easily reconfigured after we depart and captain picard has authorised me to share with you any information we obtain from the romulan databanks
 we will also need to communicate with the enterprise in sector two thirteen
 using conventional means that would be true however i suggest we piggyback our signal on romulan subspace transmissions
 a human metaphor pardon me we would use a romulan signal as a carrier for own one thus disguising its origin
 i believe it would during the last hour i have conducted a systematic review of the entire romulan subspace grid i have compared my findings with the specifications of your own transmission array they appear to be compatible
 thank you for your cooperation
 negative captain the romulan information net employs a progressive encryption lock i have been unable to penetrate their security measures
 by all means ambassador
 yes sir the twenty ninth is the only one i cannot bypass
 in what manner sir
 interesting i have not considered that and captain picard has been a role model in my quest to be more human
 yes ambassador
 you are half human
 yet you have chosen a vulcan way of life
 in effect you have abandoned what i have sought all my life
 ambassador spock may i ask a personal question
 as you examine your life do you find you have missed your humanity
 no regrets that is a human expression
 we are losing our romulan carrier wave sir
 captain the romulan subspace logs identify a transmission from the romulan surface to a barolian ship near galorndon core twelve hours ago
 this would not appear to be routine i was able to trace the source of the transmission it incorporates the code prefix of romulan intelligence
 it is a short sequence of numbers one four zero zero
 no sir
 how do you know that ambassador
 lieutenant commander data
 perhaps you would be happier in another job
 i believe so ambassador
 i will be more observant in the future sir
 communication lines have been terminated at the transmitter but i am quite certain the message was sent prior to the interruption
 i disagree commander after studying the design of this structure i have determined that our best route of escape would be the underground exit to the east of this wing i have disconnected certain security scanners to assist us i am afraid we cannot permit you to warn your guards
 captain we will need to reach our transport site in fourteen minutes
 captain i have a visual identification of senator pardek of romulus this is a barolian record of a trade negotiation in which pardek participated four years ago
 yes sir
 he has been in public service since he was a young man a senator for nine decades he is considered a man of the people he has sponsored many reforms reportedly romulan leadership considers him to be somewhat of a radical because he has been an advocate of peace throughout his career
 the district he represents is called the krocton segment he maintains a dwelling there
 there is more sir i have taken the liberty of expanding the parameters of my search and have discovered that pardek has several relatives in the krocton segment i believe you will be able to locate him there on the third day of the romulan week when the senate is not in session
 thank you sir
 removable
 no doctor they are fully integrated components
 captain kvada is this the captains quarters or my own
 these quarters were obviously intended for one crewmember sir there is but a single sleeping space
 since i do not require sleep i propose you take the shelf sir i am content to stand
 are you comfortable sir
 good night captain sleep well sir
 sir was i making noise sir
 i was processing all of the information we have accumulated on romulan society i am preparing for the task of impersonating a romulan
 would you like me to discontinue sir
 i am not looking at anything sir i am continuing to organise my files
 i am sorry if i was disturbing you sir i will not look in your direction
 do you not wish to sleep sir
 i would be happy to i have been studying the krocton segment as you asked and have selected an appropriate site for our transport
 i would not have thought it possible sir i am eager to test the success of our efforts it does remain to be seen if the romulans will accept us captain you have seemed unusually pensive since we received the news of ambassador sareks death
 i do not entirely understand sir as a vulcan ambassador spock would simply see death as the logical result of his fathers illness
 considering the exceptionally long lifespan of vulcans it does seem odd that sarek and spock did not choose to resolve those differences in the time allowed
 this is definitely the street on which the intelligence scan of spock and pardek was taken sir adjusting for the optical distortions i am able to verify the architectural features
 i am sorry captain i will be more careful
 i understand sir i have found the place where they were standing
 it is here at this doorway a legal intercessors office the name is similar to pardeks it would appear to be one of his relatives
 nonetheless i recommend we keep this location under observation i have clearly determined pardeks routine on days when the senate is not in session he invariably comes to this section after the median hour
 we are here for the day from the city of rateg
 why do you say that
 it is a misconception that all rategs speak with a particular inflection in fact there are twelve different
 we may not have to direct your view to the far corner sir
 is that not pardek
 perhaps you should appear to enjoy your soup sir
 if the pentharan spheral forecasts are correct ten to twelve degrees celsius within the first ten days
 the odds of that occurring captain are extremely unlikely given the time frame
 this way sir
 if youre referring to the first production model automobile of the twentieth century perhaps the subsequent model a might be a more apt analogy since i am doctor noonian soongs revised prototype
 is there a problem professor
 would i be correct professor in assuming that you know whether or not i am still alive in the twenty sixth century
 since you seemed to know so much about captain picard and the ship i assumed that you would
 yes sir sorry sir
 what have you learned about the tectonic stability around the drilling sites
 certainly
 two hundred nine anomalies all within acceptable parameters
 i will have your answered questions as soon as possible professor
 the computer has configured the drilling pattern and specified depths
 i know of no one who said that professor
 ready sir
 target one is emitting two thousand cubic metres per second
 target two one thousand six hundred
 co concentrations remain unchanged at upper elevations
 no change sir
 elevated co levels at twenty kilometres sir
 his queries to me primarily focused on doctor soongs
 both epicentres are beneath the two southernmost drill sites captain
 it is likely that we overestimated the geologic stability around the co pockets captain
 music professor
 yes sir mozarts jupiter symphony in c major bachs brandenburg concerto number three beethovens ninth symphony second movement molto vivace and la donna e mobile from verdis rigoletto
 computer eliminate programme one computer eliminate programme two glances at rasmussen computer eliminate programme three computer half volume
 actually i am capable of distinguishing over one hundred and fifty simultaneous compositions but in order to analyse the aesthetics i try to keep it to ten or less
 i am assisting commander la forge with a very complex calculation it demands a great deal of my concentration
 you did ask me to be thorough
 certainly as soon as my work here is completed
 yes worf
 patch him through please
 there were no errors geordi the variance must be no more than point zero six terawatts
 the motion of the dust has created a great deal of electrostatic energy in the upper atmosphere with a modified phaser blast we could create a shock front that would encircle the planet and ionise the particles
 with one exception sir the particles would be converted into a high energy plasma which our shields could absorb and then redirect harmlessly into space
 precisely sir
 if our phaser discharge is off by as little as point zero six terawatts it would cause a cascading exothermal inversion
 we would completely burn off the planets atmosphere
 aye sir
 yes sir after an eight point three second burst from the dish well discharge all eps taps through the phasers
 doctor moseleys computers can accomplish the same task sir but geordi would be better able to anticipate unexpected variances
 the deflector dish has been reconfigured captain
 stand by for autophaser interlock activating deflector beam
 activating shield invertors now
 understood sir
 i do not believe any of these items belong to you professor
 why have you stolen these objects to put in a museum
 but this vessel and the temporal distortion that coincided with your arrival
 then you are not an historian
 what are your intentions professor
 i assume your hand print will open the door whether you are conscious or not
 you were correct to suspect him sir but he is not from the future he is from the past
 i believe you will find all of the missing items in the vessel sir
 he claims to be a twenty second century inventor captain
 every nanosecond in this continuum is a moment in history once it has elapsed
 it should be interesting
 doctor jadar how closely will the enterprise need to follow the test vehicle
 the prototype has been towed into position captain
 sensors indicate the field generators on the planet surface are charging captain
 the test ship has successfully entered warp sir
 the test ship is maintaining at warp two point three five sir
 no sir the effect has been localised to within two kilometres of the wavefront
 that is four hundred and fifty percent more efficient than our own warp drive
 sir the waves power signature is fluctuating
 it is expanding toward us sir it appears to be interfering with our engines captain
 our last readings indicate the craft exploded due to extreme shearing stress
 sir sensors are coming back online
 aye sir the wave is continuing on course for the lemma two colony it is bearing zero two zero mark three two nine
 sir the wave has increased in velocity to warp four point one
 sir the energy level of the wave has increased by a factor of twelve at this rate it will have increased by a factor of two hundred by the time it reaches lemma two
 because the soliton is constantly changing in both frequency and amplitude it will be extremely difficult to achieve an exact match
 warp six point three seven
 which would require the enterprise to go through the wave
 the wave has been growing in size as well as power there is insufficient time remaining for us to circumvent it before it reaches lemma two
 the wave has increased speed to warp seven point two captain
 we have passed through the wave captain
 sir there are life forms present in that biolab
 readings also indicate the presence of a humanoid captain
 at our current speed four minutes thirty seconds sir
 captain biolab four is one of the areas that will be flooded with ion radiation
 the soliton wave has closed to ten kilometres captain
 the wave has closed to one kilometre captain
 the wave is about to overtake us sir
 the wave has been disrupted sir
 i am picking up massive gravitational fluctuations sir
 aye sir
 i have located the vico sir the vessel appears to be adrift
 outer and inner hulls have been breached decks seven through twelve are exposed to space
 i cannot sir the emergency bulkheads on that deck are in place our linkup signal cannot penetrate them
 stress readings indicate considerable pressure on the transverse supports
 yes sir but the risk of structural collapse is quite high
 this station is inoperable sir
 core transfer is engaged
 i could move the beam sir however it may initiate the collapse of the surrounding supports i recommend you and geordi return to the ship
 yes sir
 yes then i will take you to the corridor we will transport back to the enterprise from there do you understand
 i am an android my strength is many times that of a human it is going to be okay i will count to three one two three
 energise
 counsellor i must join commander la forge in engineering if you will excuse me
 nearly eighty three percent of their records have been lost
 geordi as a child did you ever experience a traumatic event
 yes
 timothy no longer has that kind of support
 fracture points indicate that the energy burst came from a range of less than three thousand metres
 the breen have outposts in this sector the attack on the vico is consistent with their battle tactics and their level of technology
 i do not understand
 aye sir
 counsellor exactly how shall i proceed
 hello timothy may i enter
 ah you are attempting to recreate the dokkaran temple of kural hanesh
 do you wish a frank evaluation nod it lacks the harmony that characterised this particular temple and dokkaran culture in general
 no i am not capable of hatred
 you are making an unwarranted extrapolation i was merely offering an aesthetic analysis of this particular model the base appears quite sturdy
 may i suggest a different approach you were attempting to construct the upper level before the supports were in place observe
 data here
 i will join you in a moment geordi data out lieutenant la forge requires my assistance
 i am designed to exceed human capacity both mentally and physically
 better is a highly subjective term i do not for example possess the ability to experience emotion as humans do
 that is correct
 my positronic brain is not capable of generating those conditions goodbye
 that would be acceptable
 the black cluster was formed almost nine billion years ago when hundreds of protostars collapsed in close proximity the resulting gravitational forces are both violent and highly unpredictable
 timothy your head movements are counterproductive can you be still
 the servo mechanisms in my neck are designed to approximate human movements i did not realize the effect was so distracting
 no i am the only one
 my service experience does not yet warrant such a position
 fear is a quality that i do not possess
 correct
 i have never had a nightmare i do not require sleep timothy are you having disturbing dreams
 is that satisfactory the hair
 thank you doctor
 you may use mine
 perhaps you should return to your quarters
 thank you re painting it is very expressive
 is your painting representative of something
 timothy you understand that you may speak with me about anything you wish any subject
 at times i too find it difficult to share my thoughts with others i am not always confident that i am expressing myself in a manner which humans can comprehend but do i know that
 he laughed
 it is certainly not consistent with his android persona
 then my work with him is done
 how counsellor
 the complex polysaccharides in reaction with the carbon dioxide produces an unusual combination of texture and effervescence
 i am not capable of tasting in the manner you suggest however i can analyse the composition of a dessert and make comparative conclusions about its possible effect on the human palate but i neither like it nor dislike it
 i have often wondered what it must be like to have ones mouth water in anticipation of the arrival of a confection or to feel the pleasure i have observed in humans as they consume it
 i am an android that will never change
 i have often wished to be human i study people carefully in order to more closely approximate human behaviour
 but i cannot take pride in my abilities i cannot take pleasure in my accomplishments
 i would gladly risk feeling bad at times if it also meant that i could also taste my dessert
 acknowledged
 phaser energy was reflected by the gravitational wavefronts it is similar to the phenomenon distorting our sensor signals
 yes sir disruptors would be ineffectual
 it would be extremely difficult to maintain
 given the effects we have observed the probability is exceedingly remote sir
 that is highly unlikely our investigations have clearly demonstrated
 timothy androids do not lie
 please explain
 it is not possible the onboard control systems for every starship require a user code clearance you could not have inadvertently affected any of the vicos systems
 timothy accompany me please go to science station i want you to recall everything you heard people say aboard the vico before it was destroyed
 sir drop the shields
 captain drop the shields
 our own shields caused the increases in the wavefronts sir we have been experiencing a harmonic amplification effect
 precisely that is also what destroyed the vico when timothy remembered similar procedures on his ship i initiated an analysis of shield output to wavefront amplitude and discovered a correlation
 difficult
 that would require an emotional context which i cannot provide
 hello timothy
 i am operating within established parameters how are you
 i have been told that imitation is the highest form of flattery
 i have many human friends i would be pleased to count you among them
 it is perplexing to me that the ullians ability to retrieve memory is so highly prized if an event were important enough to be recovered why would it have been forgotten
 that is correct
 my understanding of the human brain suggests that the process is the same for you each memory is encoded in chains of molecules if you want to retrieve it you simply access the proper rna sequence
 then in what way is it different
 perhaps you remember the pleasant memories and forget the unpleasant ones
 it would seem there is no predictable pattern to human memory
 four days eleven hours
 i assume from your tone of voice that you were unsuccessful
 emergency medical team to doctor crushers office immediately
 we seem to have eliminated the all known factors that may have caused the comas except for the ullians
 aye sir
 we have yet to receive transmissions from the two planets of the nel system perhaps they will show different results
 please clarify
 why would we do that
 yes
 you are searching for instances of iresine syndrome
 two cases of iresine syndrome on hurada three at exactly the time tarmin and his group was there
 yes captain
 we have uncovered several cases sir but we have not yet completed our investigation
 yes sir we will keep searching sir
 and were the ullians present
 counsellor are you all right
 we discovered two instances of unexplained coma on nel three while the ullians were there but tarmin was not part of the group further examination revealed that only one ullian was present at all incidents of coma jev
 an artificial environment has been constructed on the southern continent sir
 yes captain sensors are reading human life forms
 no sir
 the fragment has a density of one hundred billion kilograms per cubic centimetre as a result when it passes moab four it will cause tectonic shifts well beyond eight point seven on the richter scale
 increasing impulse power to tractor emitters eps power levels rising
 aye sir
 we have lost one of the emitter circuits
 weve lost
 the second lateral emitter circuit
 shipwide life support failure in fifteen seconds sir
 termination of all life support in five seconds
 the fragments course has been altered by one point two one degrees sir
 the characteristic response to the kriskov gambit is to counter with the elmitra exchange particularly since i have already taken both your rooks by missing that opportunity you have left your king vulnerable
 as you wish counsellor check
 intriguing you have devised a completely unanticipated response to a classic attack you will checkmate my king in seven moves
 you are a challenging opponent counsellor
 i will honour our agreement
 the intense electromagnetic whirlwinds on the moons surface make it virtually impossible to locate the source of the signal captain
 i believe so commander at starfleet academy
 i will verify it just as i thought it is a starfleet subspace distress signal standard to daedalusclass starships
 one hundred seventy two years sir
 the uss essex under the command of captain bryce shumar disappeared in this sector over two centuries ago
 i have accessed the subspace transponder signature of the essex it is identical to the signal coming from the moons surface
 shields are holding sir
 forward thrusters hav
 the denvers standard crew complement is twenty three but they were transporting five hundred seventeen colonists to the beloti sector
 aye sir
 captain we are approaching the designated coordinates
 sensors find no evidence of the shuttle anywhere within the star system
 scan shows no debris within that radius
 captain i am detecting an unusual reading it appears to be a neutrino emission with no visible source
 i have none sir i recommend we launch a probe
 sensors show no evidence of any unusual phenomenon
 the probe is no longer transmitting
 why
 initiating prelaunch sequence
 clearance is granted the shuttle is under way sir
 at warp six fifty three hours sir
 the starboard nacelle has sustained a direct impact we are venting drive plasma
 core shutdown is unsuccessful we are losing antimatter containment
 ejection systems offline core breach is imminent
 i assure you commander the cards are sufficiently randomised
 eight ace queen the dealer receives a four
 ten seven no help there a pair of ladies for the doctor the dealer receives a nine doctor may i remind you since you show the highest hand you control the next bet
 jack four deuce six
 i will also see the bet seven a possible straight for commander riker jack still no help for the klingon eight nine for the dealer
 too rich for my blood
 i recommend we use a gravitron polarimeter it will perform a similar function
 no anomalous readings were reported
 aye sir
 the distortion field is fluctuating
 there is an energy build up in the distortion field
 captain something is emerging
 the vessel is on a collision course impact in thirty six seconds
 captain i suggest we use the tractor beam to alter the other ships trajectory

 but no one has bet
 this is highly improbable
 the sound itself appears to have been real however the acoustic energy does not correspond to any ships system nor to any voice communications sent at the time you heard it
 computer perform a narrow bandwidth analysis eliminate all nonvocal waveform components
 computer continuous playback please there are approximately one thousand voices overlapping the voices are those of the enterprise crew our voices
 i have a hypothesis that may explain that captain i have analysed the recording doctor crusher made most of it is quite ordinary one hundred fifty discussions about ship operations two hundred fifty two conversations of a personal nature five couples engaged in romantic encounters
 there is evidence of some sort of disaster aboard the enterprise severe enough that the captain ordered all hands to abandon ship i have isolated three segments of the recording that are crucial
 collision course impact in thirty six seconds
 we have seen that echoes or afterimages from previous loops appear as distortions in the dekyon field we may be able to send a deliberate echo into the next loop
 if the dekyon emission is modulated correctly it will set up resonances in my positronic subprocessors i will receive the information on what you would call a subconscious level
 particle accelerators at full power
 the distortion field is fluctuating
 there is an energy build up in the distortion field
 captain something is emerging
 the vessel is on a collision course impact in thirty six seconds
 captain i recommend we use the tractor beam to alter the other ships trajectory
 starboard nacelle has sustained a direct impact we are venting drive plasma
 core shutdown is unsuccessful we are losing antimatter containment
 ejection systems are offline core breach is imminent
 i assure you commander the cards are sufficiently randomised
 three all threes
 certainly
 i have encountered the numeral three an inordinate number of times over the last two hours
 i have isolated three segments of this recording that are crucial
 collision course impact in thirty six seconds
 to date we have encountered two thousand eighty five conspicuous examples of the number three
 the distortion field is fluctuating
 there is an energy build up in the distortion field
 captain something is emerging
 the vessel is on a collision course impact in thirty six seconds
 captain i suggest we use the tractor beam to alter the other ships trajectory
 the tractor beam will not be successful i am decompressing the main shuttlebay
 at the last moment i speculated that three might refer to the number of rank insignia on commander rikers uniform that indicated to me that his suggestion might be the correct course of action
 that is possible i may also have been inadvertently responsible for the unexplained appearances of the number three
 aye sir
 we should be arriving at earth in ten hours sixteen minutes sir
 we unsuccessfully tried fifty three different computational models in an effort to simulate the movements of the nova squadron just prior to the crash
 however it was well within operational limits
 we did find that wesley opened his coolant interlock just before beginning the manoeuvre around titan
 that procedure would be extremely hazardous while the ship was in flight
 the asteroid has shattered however the core is still intact and still on a collision course with tessen three
 yes sir it is of sufficient size and density to cause planetwide damage
 it will reach the upper atmosphere in forty four seconds and impact on the planet eleven seconds later
 sir the core is composed of nitrium and chrondite it is unlikely another photon torpedo will be of any effect
 thirty seconds to impact
 impact in seventeen seconds
 the remaining debris is of no threat to the planet sir
 a levelfour diagnostic of the food replication systems has failed to detect any faults in the orientation terminals
 there is an energy fluctuation in one of the utility access corridors
 we have traced the failure to a data net interface which routes replicator selections to the correct subprocessors
 we have lost helm control sir
 aye sir
 we have not yet identified the substance commander
 there is none present in the residue either
 that would suggest the nitrium has been organically metabolised
 this residue would be the waste left behind
 the dilithium chamber shows no anomalous readings
 we believe the parasites came through the ships hull after we destroyed the asteroid near tessen three
 aye sir
 at warp nine five hours twenty minutes sir
 captain with our sensors unable to detect the parasites and given the speed with which they appear to be moving through the ship
 in several cases an exanogen gas barrier has been known to slow the progress of metal parasites
 if we reconfigure a particle beam with a high concentration of nitrium and project it toward one of the asteroids
 turbolift velocity is beginning to fluctuate captain
 we have reached the bridge sir
 captain were losing life support on decks eleven and twelve
 aye sir
 if we maintain our current speed two hours twenty three minutes sir
 aye sir
 computer transfer power from warp engines to life support
 activate bussard collector
 reconfigure hydrogen plasma mixture to include thirty percent nitrium
 project emitter beam heading zero two four mark zero four one
 the plan was successful sir
 the ferengi report their containment field is collapsing
 their reactor core is unstable captain
 two sir
 i would be pleased to escort you around the ship
 your empathic powers do not perceive anything because as an android i have no emotions
 extremely rude behaviour
 perhaps you would care for something to drink
 bartender
 there do not seem to be enough waiters on duty
 excuse me i believe i will stay
 thank you lieutenant the crowd seemed a bit too ebullient for comfort perhaps you would enjoy a quiet visit to the arboretum
 data to captain picard
 but sir chancellor alrik is waiting to receive you in holodeck seven
 in order for the lateral sensors to complete their scheduled observations additional processing time will be required
 will two hours be enough time to complete the highresolution series on the neutron star
 the rotational period of the neutron star is one point three five seconds
 given the selections i prefer fgc four seven
 shields have registered an impact however sensors show nothing in the vicinity
 the drag coefficient continues to increase our velocity has fallen by twelve percent velocity is increasing ships speed has stabilised at one quarter impulse
 i did nothing the problem seems to have corrected itself
 we have simulated several such fields but were unable to reproduce the same drag coefficient
 since we have only experienced the phenomenon once it is impossible to estimate the risks
 i believe what you are seeing is the effect of the fluid dynamic processes inherent in the large scale motion of highly rarified gas
 where
 i do not see it it is interesting that people try to find meaningful patterns in things that are essentially random i have noticed that the images they perceive sometimes suggest what they are thinking about at that particular moment besides it is clearly a bunny rabbit
 sir as we move deeper into the nebula sensors indicate that the levels of helium and trionium are continuing to rise
 no sir we are well within tolerance levels
 shields have registered an impact
 there is no indication of anything near the ship
 until we determine the cause of the drag coefficient i would not recommend it sir
 the drag coefficient is still present but it has stabilised
 it is an irregular lattice composed of approximately forty seven million strands of energy
 it may be difficult sir i am detecting a significant number of strands behind us
 at our current speed we will clear the nebula in twelve minutes four seconds
 we are moving through a dense concentration of energy strands
 captain density appears to be lower off the starboard bow
 it appears to be an energy vortex of highly complex patterns possibly a life form
 it is in direct physical contact with our shields
 aye sir no effect
 captain i am detecting a transmission emanating from within the system
 it is selfrepeating of unknown pattern
 a small moon orbiting the fourth planet
 indeterminate i am attempting to screen out sensor interference readings are still inconclusive however the moons atmosphere is capable of supporting life
 sir there is no indication of other borg activity within sensor range
 the borg are extremely computer dependent a systems failure will destroy them
 the vessel is traveling at warp seven point six mass two point five million metric tons configuration cubical
 its dimensions indicate that it is a scout ship similar to the one that crashed interference from the stars radiation will shield us from their sensors we should remain undetected until they enter the system
 at present speed they will arrive in thirty one hours seven minutes
 the shape is a paradox sir it cannot exist in real space or time
 he will be unsuccessful and will store the shape in his memory banks it will be shunted to a subroutine for further analysis
 it is designed so that each approach they take will spawn an anomalous solution the anomalies are designed to interact with each other linking together to form an endless and unsolvable puzzle
 we are now entering position radiation levels are rising
 solar radiation is rendering our sensors inoperable at last known course and speed the borg vessel should enter the system in three minutes
 we will arrive within transporter range in three minutes twenty one seconds
 negative captain sensors are unable to locate them anywhere within transporter range
 aye sir
 excuse me sir
 captain the diagnostic of the transporter system shows an anomalous energy fluctuation i will need to inspect the imaging scanner in transporter room three
 captain i have a personal favour to ask i considered commander la forge to be my best friend i believe it is my responsibility to plan and conduct the memorial service may i have your permission to do so
 thank you sir
 i believe the cause of the accident may be related to the explosion on the romulan ship
 in all likelihood the explosion damaged the romulan cloaking device causing it to discharge chroniton particles i am detecting a chroniton field in here
 i suspect they travelled through the transporter beam that may have been the cause of geordi and ros death i will go to the romulan ship perhaps i can discover the source of the emissions
 they pose no danger to humans however some of the ships systems may be affected by prolonged exposure when i return i will devise a method to eradicate them
 lieutenant i am planning a memorial service for commander la forge and ensign ro i would like you to participate
 captain picard asked me to arrange a ceremony that was appropriate i have given a great deal of thought as to what is appropriate in this instance
 hold position here
 i find i am having difficulty deciding what kind of service to have do you have any suggestions
 ensign ro was bajoran her beliefs should be reflected as well however their death rituals are quite complicated
 i am not certain that either human or bajoran rites are fitting and i have researched the funerary customs of over five thousand cultures to no avail
 resume course in almost all societies it is traditional to say a ritual farewell to those you call friends i never knew what a friend was until i met geordi he spoke to me as though i were human he treated me no differently from anyone else he accepted me for what i am and that i have learned is friendship but i do not know how to say goodbye
 why
 begin docking procedure
 chroniton emissions may have been responsible for the accident which claimed the lives of our officers
 was your cloaking device damaged in the explosion
 that explains the chroniton fields i am detecting in here now for your own safety it is important to eliminate those emissions
 there is no way to predict what will happen when the chronitons interact with the new engine core
 the field emissions are particularly strong in this area
 this is puzzling three more chroniton fields have formed aboard the enterprise in the last hour
 we should begin decontamination immediately run an internal sensor sweep for locations of all chroniton fields on the enterprise
 i do not understand how these new fields have formed no transporter beam has been active in any of those areas i cannot see that they have anything in common
 in fact they seem to be appearing at random
 can you narrow the focus of the scan to pinpoint the locations
 go to science station two on the main bridge use a lateral sensor array to get a more precise reading i will modify an anyon emitter to eliminate the fields once theyve been isolated
 data here
 acknowledged
 excuse me for interrupting lieutenant
 im detecting a chroniton field in your room may i scan the area
 do you think the others will think this service appropriate
 i am glad you approve doctor
 go ahead chief
 no
 no anyon emissions are harmless please begin immediately
 i see no reason to delay our departure the chroniton fields have been cleared from all critical areas
 curious captain i believe we should decontaminate this room before getting underway
 chief
 increase anyon emissions to six thousand particles per second and decontaminate this area
 yes sir
 i believe i may know what has happened sir
 it would explain the mysterious chroniton fields
 if they were cloaked in some way
 if i am right sir they are and in this room their brief appearance coincided with the anyon sweep perhaps the anyons neutralise the cloaking effect chief brossmer
 set the anoynic beam to its highest level and flood ten forward
 of course
 geordi it is good to see you
 it appears to be a probe of some kind but there is no starfleet record of this shape or design
 the probe is composed of paricium and talgonite a ceramic alloy
 the beam is scanning the shields perimeter the probe is emitting an unusual particle stream
 no sir the particle emission is most unusual i am unable to block it
 the probe is moving with us sir holding relative position
 commander i have been analysing the nucleonic beam i believe it would be possible to reflect the particles back toward the probe in a way that would disrupt the signal
 i am attempting to do so doctor
 the beam is fully restored doctor
 it is an unmapped system of six planets sir
 not any longer sir the star went nova all life in the system was destroyed approximately one thousand years ago
 the bifocal vision aid is typical of the era the weapon is a forty five calibre doubleaction cavalry pistol invented by colt firearms in 
 the composition of the exposed rock face has been altered by exposure to triolic waves
 the byproduct of an energy source employed by very few species because of its deleterious effect on living tissue
 interesting there is a twelve percent decomposition of the bitanium in the neural pathway links that suggests the alloys are vulnerable to
 emotion sir
 i am simply trying to make an objective assessment
 i believe so sir
 no sir my brothers positronic brain has a type l phase discriminating amplifier mine is a type r
 yes sir
 decomposition strongly indicates that life was terminated approximately five hundred years ago that would be consistent with the other artefacts we recovered
 in relative terms perhaps not nevertheless it seems clear that my life is to end in the late nineteenth century
 there is no way anyone can prevent it sir at some future date i will be transported back to nineteenth century earth where i will die it has occurred it will occur
 are you referring to the foreknowledge of my death
 i have no particular desire to discuss the matter do you need to talk about it
 why
 on the contrary i find it rather comforting
 i have often wondered about my own mortality as i have seen others around me age until now it has been theoretically possible that i would live an unlimited period of time and although some might find this attractive to me it only reinforces the fact that i am artificial
 tough as in difficult
 i expected to make new friends
 and then to outlive them as well
 it provides a sense of completion to my future in a way i am not that different from anyone else i can now look forward to death
 one might also conclude that it brings me one step closer to being human i am mortal
 counsellor commander
 would either of you mind if i made a personal inquiry
 i am perceiving an apparent change in the way others behave toward me for example people abruptly end conversations when i appear just as you did when the turbolift doors opened is that an accurate observation
 i understand i am also fond of you commander and you as well counsellor
 captain sensors are picking up an unusual temporal disturbance on a small area of the planets surface forty two degrees seven minutes north by eighty eight degrees declination east
 spectral analysis shows a high level of triolic waves emanating from the same location
 affirmative sir the magnetic signature is identical to the one found in the cavern
 only with long term exposure sir there is no immediate threat
 commander
 captain may i speak to you alone
 sir it is standard procedure that the second officer accompany the away team
 then i must assume your decision is related to the discovery on earth of
 captain there is no rational justification for this course
 it is possible sir that the events leading to my death will not occur for years even centuries
 i appreciate your concern captain but to employ an aphorism one cannot cheat fate
 go ahead
 acknowledged
 captain the results of my temporal analysis may be pertinent
 geordi it indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating
 triolic waves
 a positive displacement of point zero zero four percent
 commander we might be able to
 manipulate the synchronic distortion
 yes we do
 it is built into my positronic decompiler it will be necessary for me to join the away team sir
 sir
 once i have adjusted the forcefield i will no longer be visible commander i have taken steps however to ensure that you will still be able to hear me if you would assist me in a test of the comm system my voice will be transmitted on a delay correlated to the phase adjustment that should allow me to maintain verbal contact
 no sir that will not be possible
 adjusting the synchronic distortion point zero zero one point zero zero two fades out point zero zero three point zero zero four
 i have made visual contact there are lifeforms here
 theyre either unaware of me or choosing to ignore me i am moving approximately ten metres north of my starting position to observe more closely
 they range from two to three metres in height silver grey in colour they have four limbs no eyes or ears are noticeable there is a single orifice where a humanoid forehead would ordinarily be they are reclined against the rock face surrounding an apparatus of some sort approximately one point five metres in height
 it is releasing what appear to be energy fragments which are then ingested by the entities through the orifice perhaps some sort of nourishment
 the upper portion of the apparatus seems to be a holding facility for the energy segments there are hundreds perhaps thousands of these fragments inside i have resumed a northerly direction there is no evidence yet of humans
 i have encountered
 another lifeform an ophidian it seems to be restricted by a forcefield
 two of the silvergrey entities are approaching it they have released the forcefield
 i am reading a temporal distortion of massive proportions the ophidian is cap fritz timespace continuum
 caught in the after effect i am attempting
 excuse me pardon me i am searching for two individuals with an ophidian a snake
 that is unfortunate
 i am sorry but i have no whiskey to give you
 i am sorry but i have no form of legal tender
 i would be happy to do so but i am presently in need of information
 thank you for your advice but im trying to find two individuals with a snake
 you are in need of medical attention i will get a doctor
 sir i need temporary lodging
 i understand the source of your misperception however this is not sleepware and i do not have a missus
 i am a frenchman
 i have no money
 but i am capable of performing significant tasks both mental and physical perhaps your hotel would offer me a job
 poker
 excuse me gentlemen
 i would like to join the game
 i am a frenchman
 alors nous sommes presque frres je suis heureux de vous connaitre
 in a manner of speaking it is a crystalline composite of silicon beryllium carbon seventy and
 gold
 i accept and deals
 to whom are you referring
 what was the source of your jocular reaction what was it you found humorous
 it was not my intention to deceive
 thank you shakes his hand it has been a pleasure
 it would be advisable to monitor that cough i have read that there is currently a cholera epidemic in san francisco
 of course the gratuity thank you for your assistance
 i have no need for companionship however i do require some supplies
 i am an inventor
 will this be enough
 you may retain the surplus for yourself
 exactly
 apology is not necessary
 ow
 i believe i have overexerted myself
 yes
 this is for your trouble
 i require a low intensity magnetic field core i believe the iron mass of the anvil will provide that
 what do you think it is going to be
 that is a good guess
 perhaps
 to what are you referring
 i believe i have given you an erroneous impression
 you have a ship
 you have had a considerable spectrum of occupations
 i believe your plan is a bit premature
 thank you jack
 good afternoon i would like to speak to guinan
 data
 no
 i am a personal friend
 it is urgent that i speak to her
 that is an excellent idea i will wait for them in there
 guinan excuse me i must speak to you immediately
 i am sorry for the disruption but he would not believe me when i told him we were friends
 data yes we were on a ship together
 the enterprise
 it is a starship
 android artificial life form
 i was not sent by your father circumstances demand that i take you into my confidence i require your assistance
 i am from the twenty fourth century where you and i serve aboard a starship
 our ship encountered a species who appears to be threatening th century earth i investigated and was inadvertently pulled into their temporal vortex when i saw your photograph in the newspaper i assumed you had joined me from the future from the enterprise i knew your species was longlived but i did not realise you had visited earth so long ago
 at some future date i will be transported back to nineteenth century earth where i will die it has occurred it will occur
 data yes we were on a ship together the enterprise
 it is a starship
 i was not sent by your father our ship encountered a species who appears to be threatening nineteenth century earth
 perhaps you could arrange for us to get in
 with permission to dig for the mine shaft
 i have full confidence in your persuasive abilities
 strange the transceiver assembly has been removed without it i will be unable to track the time shifts
 clemens
 if you are correct he must be warned the device has been modified in such a way that prolonged contact with human tissue would be highly toxic
 i am french sir not swiss
 i do not believe i know mister whitley
 i am unfamiliar with the gentlemans name i have spoken to several people at that office
 as apparently you do mister clemens
 in a sense the time shift is a gearing system i have invented for the horseless carriage
 i suggest we postpone our greetings for another occasion
 the aliens appear to be able to concentrate the distortion and direct it to a specific time and place
 i have located that cavern
 how now spirit whither wander you
 it is all right
 mister clemens it is imperative that we continue our mission
 torpedoes phasing alien i am processing a binary message entered into my static memory by captain picard geordi are we planning to fire on the alien habitat
 it is imperative that we do not i will explain later
 the binary message left by the captain is not entirely clear he seemed to be concerned about the phase differential of our photon torpedoes that firing them might produce catastrophic effects
 if i am correct we must modify our weapons so that the force of the explosion is rephased into the aliens time continuum
 sir
 for what sir
 commander i am picking up massive triolic wave activity on the surface
 there are no human life signs
 no sir but triolic activity is increasing
 sir i am detecting a temporal distortion on the surface and human life signs
 our scanners cannot penetrate the plasma streamers distortion field
 no sir ionic interference is too heavy
 bridge to captain picard
 the away team is returning to the enterprise sir
 aye sir
 the analysis of the fragments is not yet complete
 the container does show evidence of residual ionisation i believe your hypothesis was correct it was used to store high energy plasma
 perhaps we should attempt to recreate their experiment to see what happens when matter is beamed aboard under similar conditions
 are you all right lieutenant
 geordi lieutenant barclay appears inordinately preoccupied with his physiological condition i have seen him check his pulse rate as well as his visual acuity several times over the last twenty minutes
 structural reinforcement is at two hundred forty percent
 a standard analysis begins with a resonance frequency scan
 initiating resonance sweep frequency range at three
 that is correct they appear to be quasienergy microbes that exist within the distortion field of the plasma streamer
 normal spatial relationships are often distorted within the matter stream your perceptions may have been exaggerated
 the microbes exist simultaneously as both matter and energy the biofilter cannot distinguish them from the matter stream
 the molecules would begin to emit nucleonic particles we may be able to derive a pattern the computer would recognise
 your pattern would degrade to the point where your signal would be permanently lost
 captain sensors have located the transport ship two rekag battle cruisers are flanking it
 the cruisers weapons are powered up but sir the rekag ships are turning and heading out of sensor range
 we are within visual range of the transport sir
 sensors indicate damage to the dorians subspace emitter audio communication only
 counsellor troi has altered her appearance
 captain i have identified the signal it is from the uss jenolen a federation transport ship reported missing in this sector seventy five years ago
 there are no stars or other stellar bodies listed on our navigational charts however sensors indicate the presence of an extremely strong gravitational source in this vicinity
 i am having difficulty scanning the object it appears to be approximately two hundred million kilometres in diameter
 the objects enormous mass is causing a great deal of gravimetric interference that might have prevented our sensors from detecting it before we dropped out of warp
 the object does fit the general parameters of dysons theory
 possibly a great number of people commander the interior surface area of a sphere this size is the equivalent of more than two hundred and fifty million class m planets
 i have located the jenolen sir it is impacted on the surface of the sphere
 there are no life signs however there are several small power emanations and life support is still functioning on minimal levels
 sensor readings indicate the presence of a gtype star at the centre of the sphere there also appears to be a classm atmosphere clinging to the interior surface
 not as yet sir our preliminary data suggests it is still capable of supporting life we have been unable to find definite signs of current habitation
 aye sir
 i believe i may be of some assistance captain scott is unaware of the existence of synthehol
 yes sir it is an alcohol substitute now being served aboard starships it simulates the appearance taste and smell of alcohol but the intoxicating affects can be easily dismissed
 no sir i am an android lieutenant commander data
 i believe guinan does keep a limited supply of nonsyntheholic products perhaps one of them would be to your liking
 it is looks at bottle it is sniffs contents
 commander i believe i have found something on the sphere which could be a communications device theres an antenna array approximately four hundred thousand kilometres south of our present position it is emitting low intensity subspace signals
 no sir not from our present orbit the array is currently directed away from us
 sensors indicate that the large circle is a portal or airlock possibly leading to the interior of the sphere
 some type of tractor beam has locked onto us
 the resonance frequency of the tractor beams is incompatible with our power systems warp and impulse engine relays have been overloaded i am attempting to compensate
 approximately ninety million kilometres from the stars photosphere i am reading a great deal of surface instability it may be
 we will enter the suns photosphere in three minutes
 our flight path is changing right ten point seven degrees sir insufficient to clear the photosphere
 aye sir
 the sphere appears to be abandoned sensors show that the star is extremely unstable it is experiencing severe bursts of radiation and matter expulsions
 i believe we triggered a series of automatic piloting beams designed to guide ships into the sphere
 it is a solar flare captain magnitude twelve class b
 the star has entered a period of increased activity sensors indicate that the solar flares will continue to grow in three hours our shields will no longer be sufficient to protect us sir
 the interior surface area is over ten to the sixteenth square kilometres it will take seven hours to completely scan the surface
 i will endeavour to speed up the process sir
 with impulse engines operating at sixty percent power it will take one minute and forty seconds
 we are within transporter range
 mister scott
 the modification would increase our sensor efficiency and imaging resolution by twenty five percent or more
 commander i would like to remind you about my poetry reading this afternoon
 then we sat on the sand for some time and observed
 that poem was written in anapaestic tetrameter for my ninth poem
 throughout the ages from keats to jorkemo poets have composed odes to individuals who have had a profound effect on their lives in keeping with that tradition i have written my next poem in honour of my cat i call it ode to spot
 commander you have anticipated my denouement however the sentiment is appreciated i will continue
 geordi active scanner output has increased by twenty six percent
 geordi may i make a personal inquiry it concerns my poetry reading
 i noticed that many spectators seemed distracted during my presentation was my poetry uninteresting
 thank you and
 did it evoke an emotional response
 your hesitation suggests you are trying to protect my feelings however since i have none i would prefer you to be honest an artists growth depends upon accurate feedback
 then i did not succeed in my efforts
 i am reading a massive eps explosion
 i am attempting to localise it it is cargo bay four
 the field imbalance has subsided
 what is it
 are you all right geordi
 i will run the integrity scan
 i have just started the scan did you not go to sickbay
 that is not possible my internal chronometer indicates you have been gone for exactly one minute fifteen seconds
 computer what is the time please
 you are correct ninety two minutes seventeen seconds have passed since you left the room
 i have no memory of events during that period when we are finished here i will perform a selfdiagnostic
 sensors are functioning normally they are detecting a subspace particle emission originating from within this room
 the emission is emanating from this direction geordi
 the structure of the bulkhead has been altered on a subatomic level the metal itself is in a state of quasimolecular flux
 it appears to be composed of spatially inverted tetryon particles we believe they are emanating from a tertiary subspace manifold
 i have completed my self diagnostic and have confirmed that i was not aboard the enterprise for ninety minutes seventeen seconds yesterday afternoon
 whenever i am on the ship the warp field leaves an electromagnetic signal on my internal servofluid system between the period of twelve fifty four and fourteen twenty six hours that signature is missing
 it appears to be the beginnings of a spatial rupture
 at the rate the rupture is expanding we will soon be in danger of hull breach
 no sir the spatial rupture is creating severe nucleonic interference it is impossible to obtain a positive lock on the bulkheads
 tetryon particles have a random momentum our sensors cannot track them sir
 the rupture has expanded another four point two percent
 without further reinforcement containment field integrity will fail in approximately fourteen minutes
 at the present rate containment failure will occur in approximately nine minutes
 captain the containment field is beginning to fluctuate failure anticipated in
 three minutes eleven seconds
 data to engineering the graviton pulse is having an effect tetryon emissions have decreased by nineteen percent
 captain additional subharmonics have appeared they are reinforcing the tetryon emissions they appear to be counteracting the graviton pulse
 the rupture is beginning to expand again sir
 tetryon emissions continue to increase the rupture is still expanding
 hull breach is imminent
 the rupture is beginning to close sir
 the rupture is eighty six percent closed
 based on the information gathered by commander rikers tricorder we have determined that the molecular structure of the alien life forms is solanogenbased
 the tricorder readings indicate they created a small pocket of our universe in their laboratory to keep those they abducted alive
 no sir we were unable to track it once it left the cargo bay
 possibly they were simply curious explorers like ourselves
 imagination is not necessary the scale is readily quantifiable we are presently generating twelve point seven five billion gigawatts per
 temperature in the reaction chamber has increased by forty seven percent
 temperature increase is at one hundred six percent and rising
 plasma inductors are not responding
 temperature in the reaction chamber has returned to normal
 yes captain
 it is not consistent with what we know of them sir
 aye sir
 captain message coming in from tagra four
 captain
 i have some information regarding amanda rogers parents records indicate that they died in topeka kansas their home was destroyed during a tornado
 unknown sir the bodies were found in the rubble after the storm had passed
 aye sir
 captain
 i have further information regarding the tornado that killed amanda rogers parents
 it was unusually compact yet extremely powerful its recorded wind velocity was characteristic of a funnel three times its size
 aye sir
 if we can use phase buffers we may be able to devise a mechanism that can be integrated into the present system while it is in operation
 captain i am reading a massive energy fluctuation in the planets atmosphere
 atmospheric contaminants have dropped to less than one part per trillion the ecosystem has been restored to its natural state
 almost it is being stored in shuttlebay two sir
 weve been scanning the area since entering the system but our readings are being disrupted
 extreme fluctuations in the electromagnetic field however there is no evidence of stellar or seismic activity which would cause the interference
 minor damage to one ship its shields are holding
 sensors and secondary generators are offline life support down to sixty seven percent
 i am detecting transporter signatures in three cargo bays we are being boarded sir
 in theory my neural network should be able to sustain key systems until primary control is restored
 geordi i have noticed that you have not shaved are you attempting to grow another beard
 as is the case with many natural growth processes it is difficult to envision the end product based on an intermediate stage
 one moment
 i do not understand you are constantly working on similar electronic systems yet their appearances do not disturb you
 thank you geordi nor are you just another biological organism
 yes establishing computer linkup interface complete
 i am now attempting to access the long range sensor array
 i will perform a routine maintenance check on the starboard inertial damping system
 initiating gravitational
 there appears to be an energy fluctuation in my neural net i am disconnecting my interface to the computer interface deactivated
 i have experienced a brief power surge in my positronic subprocessor but i am fine
 geordi perhaps this problem is related to our interface experiment
 and i will perform a selfdiagnostic
 wheres my boy
 no hes more valuable to us alive
 feline supplement one hundred twenty seven spot i have formulated a new mixture of foods specifically designed for your highly selective tastes
 i find it extremely difficult to predict what you will find acceptable perhaps hunger will compel you to try it again
 spot you are disrupting my ability to work
 vamoose you little varmint
 howdy sheriff
 the name is frank hollander what are you smiling at
 my boy
 well then well just have to work something out is there anything you want in exchange for my boy
 is that so is that so what about your deputy
 not so fast
 i aint in the mood for games sheriff
 i wouldnt walk out that door if i was you sheriff
 oh now isnt that a shame poor sheriffs been injured whats the matter was my pa a little too rough on you
 what
 temper temper sheriff my pa aint going to like if i come home all bruised
 when the interface malfunction occurred subroutine c forty seven was replaced by elements from my personal programming
 that would explain why your music composition programme began playing the slavonic dances i have been analysing the collected works of antonin dvorak
 i have been formulating nutritional supplements for spot
 we are currently attempting to isolate the corrupt circuit pathways i reckon the process should take less then two hours
 i said the process should take less than two hours
 according to my memory log i did not use those words yall must be mistaken
 did whut
 can i help you with somethin
 ive came to see my boy
 better take a good look at that gun sheriff you might be seeing it again real soon
 pa
 eli how are they treating you boy
 real bad pa they aint fed me since i got here and the sheriffs been roughin up on me somethin fierce
 dont you worry boy the sheriffs going to pay whos the stranger
 dont know she aint said her name but shes in cahoots with the sheriff and shes mighty mean with that winchester
 you sit tight boy ill have you home in time for supper im going to give you one more opportunity sheriff to avoid a ugly situation release my boy
 i thought you might have a change of heart meet me in two hours you be in front of the saloon ill be in front of the livery station strangers aint invited
 howdy commander
 well we figure part of my memory structure normally was replaced with information from the computers recreational data base
 you got it partner
 commander you just sit tight well have this all fixed up in time for supper
 eli get down
 senor frank
 go ahead shoot me
 lets go
 sheriff youre as handy with a shooting iron as you are with a womans heart
 enterprise to commander la forge
 i am reading significant power fluctuations from the station core please report
 do you require assistance
 enterprise to la forge what is your situation
 commander la forge please report
 how were you able to accomplish the repair so quickly
 energise
 welcome to the enterprise doctor i am lieutenant commander data
 and i have studied your design for the particle fountain i find the concept to be highly innovative
 i am curious how you were able to repair the power grid so quickly
 actually that is no longer the case i have recently converted my interlink sequencer to asynchronous operation which removed the performance constraint
 the interlink sequencer is now bidirectional it compensates for the asynchronous mode distortion arising from the resonant field
 exocomps
 the correct procedure would be to adjust the converter
 a mode stabiliser
 you have incorporated a microreplication system into the device in order to fashion tools
 so in a sense they are learning
 exocomps are highly sophisticated devices sir if they perform up to expectation their potential to advance this project is considerable
 thank you doctor i welcome the opportunity
 i agree doctor
 i have successfully completed fourteen separate tasks with this exocomp in the past hour i estimate it would take two people nine hours to complete the same tasks i would characterise the units performance as excellent
 i am confident they will commander la forge is especially
 it is not accepting your commands
 doctor
 geordi the interface circuitry which links the exocomp to the control pad is completely burned out
 no
 interesting the number of new circuit pathways has increased by six hundred thirty two percent
 doctor the new pathways do not appear to be interfering with the original circuitry
 apparently there was a microfracture in the conduit wall the fault did not register on our instruments
 geordi are you implying the exocomp exhibited some form of selfpreservation
 computer perform a level one diagnostic of the exocomps command module
 how can that be if the interface circuitry is burned out
 curious computer access the exocomps sensor logs confirm that there was a failure of the interface circuitry within the last twelve hours
 how and when was it repaired
 why would the exocomp burn out its own interface circuitry and repair it two hours later
 doctor are you injured
 doctor what is the definition of life
 i am searching for a definition that will allow me to test an hypothesis
 and you suggest that anything which exhibits these characteristics is considered alive
 what about fire
 yes it consumes fuel to produce energy it grows it creates offspring by your definition is it alive
 and what about me i do not grow i do not reproduce i am considered to be alive
 i wonder if that is so
 i am curious as to what transpired between the moment when i was nothing more than an assemblage of parts in doctor soongs laboratory and the next moment when i became alive what was it that endowed me with life
 are you saying the question cannot be answered
 i believe i understand doctor
 on the contrary you have been a great deal of help thank you
 doctor i must ask you to stop using the exocomps
 no it is not that i have reason to believe the exocomps are alive
 sir when the exocomp left the access tunnel prior to the explosion it may have been attempting to save itself from destruction
 yes when you attempted to override the exocomp and send it back into the tunnel it responded by deliberately burning out its control interface
 the computer diagnostic showed that the exocomp disabled its own interface
 however two hours later when it was aboard the enterprise and no longer in danger it repaired itself i believe the exocomp was protecting itself and if that is true it has demonstrated an awareness of its environment and an ability to adapt to that environment
 doctor there is a big difference between you and a virus but both are alive
 thank you sir and until we have a definitive answer i believe it would be inappropriate to exploit the exocomps as labourers
 yes
 we have created a small conduit breach in this tube the exocomp would normally require several minutes to complete a repair of this type once it enters the tube it will find that a plasma cascade failure is in progress
 thank you for your help doctor
 as do i sir thank you
 that is true
 i have completed thirty four additional tests and the results have been the same in each of them perhaps i was wrong in suspecting the exocomp was alive
 you said earlier that i am unique if so then i am alone in the universe when i began investigating the exocomps i realised i might be encountering a progenitor of myself suddenly the possibility exists that i was no longer alone for that reason i the exocomp has returned
 in the previous thirty four trials i brought it back once the simulated failure occurred this time we were talking and i neglected to do that
 do not apologise doctor i believe we have discovered something significant
 the exocomp has replicated a different tool that is not the molecular fuser it had when it entered the jefferies tube doctor the exocomp not only completed the repairs it also deactivated the overload signal
 it was and the exocomp must have realised that it saw that there was no real danger and completed the repairs
 i see no other possible explanation
 commander the particle fountain is continuing to surge at the present rate the radiation in the station core will reach fatal levels in twenty three minutes
 a force field was activated on the station a few moments ago it is possible that commander la forge has established a low intensity deflector field
 no sir my readings indicate that it will fail in approximately twenty two minutes
 i estimate that it would take a minimum of sixty five minutes to properly configure the torpedo
 commander i must object to that plan
 doctor crusher and i discovered that the exocomp did not fail the test it is still my belief we are dealing with a new life form
 commander if i am correct the exocomps will not allow themselves to be destroyed they have a sense of survival and they will shut down before they will comply with the order
 commander that will not be necessary the transporter is not malfunctioning i have locked out the controls
 i cannot do that sir
 that is your prerogative sir under starfleet regulations direct insubordination is a court martial offence but i will not release the transporter
 commander please do not think this is an arbitrary decision i have considered the ramifications of my actions carefully and i do not believe it is justifiable to sacrifice one life form for another
 it is true i am acting on my personal beliefs but i do not see how i can do otherwise
 i have observed that humans often base their judgments on what is referred to as instinct or intuition because i am a machine i lack that particular ability however it may be possible that i have insight into other machines that humans lack
 then let me offer an alternative transport me to the station i will attempt a complete manual shut down of the particle stream
 commander if i give my life to save my fellow officers that is my choice the exocomps no longer have a choice
 that sounds reasonable sir if they choose to go i would be willing to release the transporter lock out
 if the exocomps do not shut down after i have programmed them we may assume they are willing to go
 they seem to be reprogramming the commands i have entered
 clearly they unwilling to be transported into the stream for detonation although they may have an alternate solution
 no doctor but they do have superior experience during their service they have interfaced with every part of the station core something none of us has done including yourself they may have another way to control the particle surge
 those appear to be power taps
 can you lock on to the exocomps
 it was the only way to save the other two
 thank you doctor i wish your work on the particle fountain had been more successful perhaps the exocomps will help you to reconstruct it
 doctor
 yes sir i thought you might want to know why i would be willing to risk your life for several small machines
 no sir it was not when my status as a living being was in question you fought to protect my rights and for that i will always be grateful the exocomps had no such advocate if i had not acted in their behalf they would have been destroyed i could not allow that to happen sir
 he is the commanding officer of the cairo
 sir the transfer interface was not designed for that configuration it will take seven hours to make those changes
 we will arrive in fifty one hours thirty two minutes sir
 that is an attainable goal but it will require realigning the warp coil and taking the secondary distribution grid offline
 i believe that is also an attainable goal if we utilise the entire engineering department there should be sufficient manpower available to complete the task
 captain on the bridge
 captain on the bridge
 it is possible that the cardassians were specifically interested in capturing captain picard
 the metagenic weapon they were supposedly developing used a thetaband subspace delivery system captain picard is one of only three starfleet captains with extensive experience in thetaband devices the other two are no longer in starfleet
 if your theory is correct the cardassians may be planning an attack somewhere in this sector
 aye sir set course three five zero mark two one five and engage at warp eight point five
 in seventeen hours their hull degradation will reach dangerous levels they will have to leave before that
 it was then that i began to suspect that your brother did not die by his own hand that he was in fact murdered
 that was the first clue watson the vial contained strychnine which as you well know induces violent muscular spasms it is difficult to imagine that someone in the throes of so gruesome a death could have held on to so delicate a container without shattering it
 exactly the vial was placed in his hand after he died
 the cigar of course
 upon closer inspection of the room where your brother was found i discovered a fresh burn mark on the carpet further analysis of the ash revealed that the cigar was laced with strychnine
 with practice handwriting can be forged it takes a trained eye to notice certain discrepancies for example whether someone is right or left handed
 your brother was right handed the alleged suicide note was written by a left handed individual such as yourself
 curious there seems to be a problem in the holodecks spatial orientation systems
 sherlock holmes programme three a has demonstrated some very curious anomalies
 since both planets are gas giants neither possesses a solid surface their atmospheres however will come into contact in approximately seventeen hours nine minutes
 data to security send two officers to holodeck three
 this contradicts everything we know about holodeck physics
 there is also no way of knowing if the professors ability to exist off the holodeck is permanent it may be unwise to consider creating a second individual while this uncertainty exists
 within the next five hours sir
 command functions are being rerouted sir
 unknown sir
 aye sir
 perhaps we should consider the transporter system it uses many of the same principles as the holodeck both for example are capable of converting energy into matter
 however if it were possible to lock onto the object it might rematerialise with the same molecular cohesion as conventional matter
 set the pattern enhancers around whatever object you wish to transport i will proceed to the transporter room and begin modifications
 go ahead lieutenant
 modifications are complete
 stand by
 activating pattern enhancers energising i am having difficulty establishing a pattern lock to technician boost the confinement beam please pattern lock established
 energising
 no it lost its cohesion as soon as the transporter cycle was complete
 agreed however we may be able to learn something from the attempt
 computer display the transport logs for the sequence just completed no data available computer what is being displayed here
 that is the correct log however no information
 is being presented
 it is almost as if
 our attempt to transport the chair never occurred
 geordi
 captain i have determined how moriarty was able to leave the holodeck he never did neither did we none of this is real it is a simulation we are still on the holodeck
 through deduction sir lieutenant barclay and i tried to transport a simulated object off the holodeck something that has never been attempted since the transporter itself is a simulation the computer had no real data from which to create the transport logs
 then i saw you working the padd with your left hand commander la forge is right handed sir a similar malfunction occurred in the sherlock holmes programme i was running before moriarty first appeared
 moriarty appears to have programmed the holodeck to accept only his commands
 you and i are real sir as is lieutenant barclay we entered the holodeck together when we first went to see moriarty
 i believe that is the case sir
 you may have inadvertently given professor moriarty the means of gaining control of the real enterprise
 less than three hours
 did moriarty release the voice commands captain
 when he was attempting to contact the real bridge he was in fact speaking to a simulation
 in a way doctor however there is no physicality the programme is continuous but only within the computers circuitry
 there is no sign of the freighter sir we are the only ship in the area
 sensors indicate no other ships within three light years
 it appears to be the remains of a ship my analysis indicates that it was an antares class freighter
 i do not believe so sir that would not be consistent with the debris pattern however sensors indicate extremely high levels of residual antiprotons
 correct based on the antiproton decay i would estimate the incident occurred within the last four point three hours
 sensors are picking up a polarised magnetic distortion to our port side
 the distortion is extremely weak sir it appears to be moving slowly it is gone sir
 the distortion no longer registers on our instruments
 unknown sir our understanding of romulan technology is still limited
 the distortion has reappeared sir bearing three three seven mark ten it has disappeared again sir
 it has disappeared once again sir i believe it may have been coming to a halt
 sir the magnetic distortion has reappeared
 it appears to be moving toward us closing slowly its bearing indicates a possible collision course
 i am unable to make a precise measurement however i would estimate impact within ninety seconds
 time to impact approximately sixty seconds
 are you feeling all right
 captain thomas halloway perhaps i should escort you to sickbay
 senior officers please report to the captains ready room
 commander i am reading a minor power drain in the starboard eps conduit
 the problems originating in sickbay there has been an unauthorized access into the computers bioimaging systems
 aye sir
 excuse me do you have authorisation to work in this area
 i am sorry but use of sickbay equipment is limited to ships medical personnel
 data
 yes
 i would be happy to do so however i must ask you to stop your experiment
 what type of device is this
 it appears to employ plasma inputs
 i suggest we take it to engineering and run a complete circuitpathway diagnostic
 if we transfer twenty megajoules of energy from the dilithium chamber into the plasma inputs it should be sufficient to activate the device
 certainly
 i can control the rate of my follicle replenishment however i have not yet had a reason to modify the length of my hair why do you ask
 power conduits are ready is something wrong doctor
 yes i do have a functional respiration system however its purpose is to maintain thermal control of my internal systems i am in fact capable of functioning for extended periods in a vacuum
 my circulatory system not only produces biochemical lubricants it regulates microhydraulic power most people are interested in my extraordinary abilities how fast i can compute my memory capacity how long i will live no one has ever asked me if my hair will grow or noticed that i can breathe
 power connections are complete
 of course we are ready geordi
 transient response is normal
 i believe so what has happened
 that cannot be possible i have a memory record for that period of time i can recall a series of images i saw doctor soong my father
 my internal diagnostic indicates that my memory systems are functioning within normal parameters for the forty seven seconds that i was inactive there is no record of cognitive activity
 that cannot be the image i saw was of doctor soong as a young man i did not encounter him until much later in his life there appears to be no rational explanation for my experience
 how so
 i am not capable of either of those functions
 at present i cannot
 i am sorry to bother you but i have a question of a personal nature do you have a moment
 i have heard you mention that you once experienced a vision
 i understand it involves deep meditation in the lava caves of nomat that prolonged exposure to the heat induces a hallucinatory effect
 i have recently had an unusual experience which might be described as a vision
 an accident in engineering shut down my cognitive functions for a short period of time yet i seemed to remain conscious i saw my father
 if it was a vision i do not know how to proceed
 but i am not looking for my father
 thank you worf
 i am sorry to disturb you sir
 i require your advice i have come to an impasse regarding my recent unexplained experience
 i have analysed over four thousand different religious and philosophical systems as well as over two hundred psychological schools of thought in an effort to understand what happened
 i have been unable to find a single interpretation of the images i saw during the time i was shut down the hammer for instance has several meanings the klingon culture views the hammer as a symbol of power however the taqua tribe of nagor sees it as an icon of hearth and home the ferengis view it as a sign of sexual prowess
 the interpretation of visions and other metaphysical experiences are almost always culturally derived and i have no culture of my own
 i believe i understand sir thank you
 come in
 i am painting
 i have created twenty three individual illustrations in the past six hours twenty seven minutes i believe you could say i have been inspired
 i have done as captain picard suggested i have tried to explore the images
 i am not certain i began by painting the image of the blacksmith then i painted the corridor after that the anvil the hammer and doctor soongs face the thought then occurred to me that i should paint smoke
 i cannot explain it it is not an image i saw during my vision
 perhaps after i painted the smoke it then occurred to me to paint a birds wing i then drew an entire bird a flock of birds flying in formation an individual feather if the image of a bird is related to my vision i do not understand how i am left with more of a mystery than ever geordi i would like to recreate the experiment which caused my initial shut down
 i do not know how much longer my vision would have continued had i not been reactivated
 i am aware of the risks involved but i can think of no other way to investigate my experience will you help
 i will prepare the power transfer
 agreed
 the bird did not appear in my original experience this vision is different
 what is happening father
 we are on the bridge of the enterprise my cat is present my potted plant and my paintings
 i do not understand
 what type of journey
 i do not understand
 the images i saw during the time i was shut down were generated by a series of previously dormant circuits in my neural net i believe doctor soong incorporated those circuits into my base programming intending to activate them when i reached a certain level of development
 that is correct
 i plan to shut down my cognitive functions for a brief period each day i hope to generate new internal visions
 an accurate analogy
 of course not
 captain
 it has been quite a day has it not
 however a change of routine is often invigorating and can be a welcome diversion after a long assignment
 i understand that arkaria has some very interesting weather patterns
 yes sir i am attempting to fill a silent moment with nonrelevant conversation
 yes sir i have found that humans often use small talk during awkward moments therefore i have written a new subroutine for that purpose how did i do
 thank you sir i will
 it is very good to see you both again beverly may i call you beverly beverly have you noticed that the mean temperature here on arkaria is slightly higher normal for human comfort levels i have found that humans prefer a body temperature of twenty one degrees celsius in order to operate most efficiently however there are several cultures who actually prefer that their body temperature is identical to the temperature of the room in which they are standing the sheliak for example
 hmm yes i find it fascinating that your family chose to drop the prefix pel from your surname it was my understanding that pel orton is a more noble appellation on arkaria than simply orton
 perhaps the recent arkarian trend toward a more egalitarian society is partly responsible eh
 as a matter of fact i find it oddly amusing
 there are several cultures in this sector with extremely similar etymological histories for example
 the pleasure is mine hutch i have been meaning to compliment you on your choice of colours here
 i can well imagine the light in this room would make colour selection exceptionally problematic
 yes but tyrellian laser art is very similar in both form and composition
 really did you know that there are currently five tyrellians serving aboard the enterprise
 i was aware of that but are you aware that tyrellia is one of seven known planets with no atmosphere whatsoever
 it is possible that geordi upset their timetable when he saw the hidden weapons
 if they do not have a plan for this contingency we may have the initiative
 perhaps we can use the visor as a weapon if the optical transducer were modified we might be able to generate a hypersonic pulse
 that was a perimeter warning from the remmler array a small ship is approaching i believe mister orton has dropped his defence shields
 i will try sir
 data to captain picard do you read me sir
 are you all right captain
 sir an unidentified
 scout ship has just beamed someone off the enterprise
 do you know anything about it
 actually good morning sir ship status is
 aye sir
 im sorry sir but stellar cartography has requested a communications blackout while they run an experiment
 another three hours twenty two minutes sir i can override it if necessary
 aye sir
 captain i would like to remind you of our concert this evening in ten forward we will perform chopins trio in g minor
 i noticed that the applause this evening exceeded average decibel levels
 excuse me i have not yet congratulated ensign cheney
 is there a problem geordi
 music i do not hear anything
 thermal deflectors generate a field approximately four hundred metres wide we would need to crossconnect six units and align them so the fields overlap
 captain i have completed the spectral evaluation of the outer shell our survey of this protostar is complete
 at our present speed we will arrive at the atalia system in thirty seven hours
 i have located the shuttle it is under attack
 professor galen is still inside his vessel sir his vital signs are barely registering
 when he was attacked professor galen began to protect certain files in his computer memory
 they could mean anything unless we can narrow the parameters of the search it would be almost impossible for the computer to identify the pattern with any accuracy
 yes sir the logs indicate professor galen visited an unexplored star system ruah four
 four days at warp six sir
 ruah four is a classm planet sixty seven percent of its surface is covered with water its landmass contains multiple animal species including a genus of protohominids
 there is nothing to indicate former occupancy by even a primitive culture sir
 the indri system was first identified by federation vessels nearly sixty years ago the eighth planet is lclass it is covered by deciduous vegetation unexplored with no apparent evidence of civilisations either present or past the planet possesses no animal life whatsoever
 sensors are picking up severe atmospheric fluctuations on the planet
 all life on the planet is being destroyed sir
 if we narrow the search parameters to the biological database it might increase the chances of the computer finding a match
 the genetic information must have been incorporated into the earliest lifeforms on these planets and then passed down through each generation
 seventeen sir
 aye sir
 we are approaching the loren system
 we are now entering orbit
 captain
 captain
 the computer is processing the data i will be notified as soon as there is any information
 i am familiar with many klingon rituals including the baht qul
 my upper spinal support is a polyalloy designed to withstand extreme stress my skull is composed of cortenide and duranium
 you are attempting to bribe me
 you suggested a plan that would work to your advantage one that i would be capable of executing you then implied a reward clearly you were
 the computer has completed its analysis
 the star is in sector two one four five nine the rahm izad system
 i am scanning all seven planets of the vilmoran system none appears to support life
 correction the second planet shows evidence of an ancient ocean now dry
 yes and it still may in a limited fashion not detectable by our long range sensors
 i am reading a small pocket of vegetative life a primitive lichen growing in a fossilised seabed
 most humanoids have the potential to be irrational perhaps you should attempt to access that part of your psyche
 youre becoming agitated
 i can see we have a lot of work to do
 perhaps we should continue this discussion next week
 youre starting to sound angry again maybe you need another treatment
 youre becoming agitated
 i can see we have a lot of work to do
 commander i must compliment you on your performance this evening
 your unexpected choice to improvise was an effective method of drawing the audience into the plight of your character you gave a truly realistic interpretation of multiinfarct dementia
 commander
 commander are you all right
 captain the shuttle has been launched
 external temperature is zero point nine million kelvins and rising radiation levels are nearing ten thousand rads
 outside temperature is rising rapidly one point seven million kelvins
 radiation levels outside the shuttle are nearing fourteen thousand rads
 sensors indicate an increased level of baryon particles in the cabin
 baryon levels are continuing to rise sir
 the shuttle is emerging from the corona sir
 the flow regulator is functioning properly
 yes doctor
 i am unable to locate any malfunction all systems are operating according to your design specifications
 perhaps there was an unexpected interaction between the solar radiation and the metaphasic shield
 i am running additional diagnostics to make certain there was no permanent radiation damage to the shuttlecraft hull
 there was no evidence to suggest sabotage
 the system interlocks prevent access to the circuitry unless the shield emitter is active any attempt to sabotage the device would have to be made while the shield was in operation
 that is correct it seems unlikely that jobril would perform sabotage which would result in his own death
 a phased ionic pulse beamed directly into the metaphasic projection matrix would result in a temporary system malfunction
 such a pulse could be initiated from the lateral sensor arrays science labs one four and sixteen or any of the bridge science stations
 a tetryon field would be formed briefly in the cabin temporarily disrupting the metaphasic shield
 captain an unscheduled launch is taking place in shuttlebay two
 bearing two seven one mark four sir she is headed into the suns corona
 sir the shuttle is entering the corona
 captain there is no indication of debris however the subspace signal indicates a warp engine breach
 good morning commander
 i found it extremely interesting the lateral sensor arrays ran three separate spectral analyses of the alawanir nebula on three distinct frequencies
 i will have the report sent to you sir we are still on course for the gariman sector our speed is warp six eta thirteen hundred hours sickbay reported one minor injury in the exobiology department at zero four twenty hours
 yes sir i was not informed of any change in the duty roster
 the appearance of kahless in the lava caves is consistent with the stories found in the klingon sacred texts
 lieutenant may i ask a question in the absence of empirical data how will you determine whether or not this is the real kahless
 faith then you do believe kahless may have supernatural attributes as an android i am unable to accept that which cannot be proven through rational means i would appreciate hearing your insights on this matter
 they have been sitting here for three hours seventeen minutes they refuse to transport back to the ship with the rest of gowrons men they insisted on waiting here until they see kahless again their faith appears to be unaffected by his inability to defeat gowron they still believe
 does that mean you no longer believe this is the real kahless
 i am curious do you still think the real kahless will return someday or has this experience only deepened the spiritual crisis which originally sent you to boreth
 i understand your dilemma i once had what could be considered a crisis of the spirit
 yes the starfleet officers who first activated me on omicron theta told me i was an android nothing more than a sophisticated machine with human form however i realised that if i were simply a machine i could never be anything else i could never grow beyond my programming i found that difficult to accept so i chose to believe that i was a person that i had the potential to be more than a collection of circuits and subprocessors it is a belief which i still hold
 i made a leap of faith
 data to commander riker
 commander you are needed on the bridge
 yes sir it appears we will be able to transport to the surface sooner than anticipated
 no sir using the potemkins transport logs from the original evacuation commander la forge and i were able to modify the transporters
 the transporters are considerably more efficient than those used on the potemkin eight years ago
 ninety seven minutes sir
 twenty six minutes after that the distortion field will rephase
 the planets proximity to its sun will create two additional transport windows in the next three days
 it will have to be sir the next transport window will not occur for another eight years when the planets orbit will bring it close enough to the sun to dephase the distortion field
 aye sir
 commander
 commander someone is approaching a humanoid forty metres due east and closing
 may i ask how you got here
 why did you not return to the potemkin with the others
 an interesting approach he must have been planning to reintegrate the two patterns in the transport buffer
 many of its components have been removed apparently lieutenant riker used them to keep the stations radiation shield operational
 we have less than three minutes left
 the game is five card draw no limit ante please
 lieutenant
 mister worf
 commander
 dealer takes two you control the bet lieutenant
 i will call
 dealer folds
 lieutenant i am curious about something if you met a double of yourself would you have difficulty interacting with him
 why
 but commander riker and lieutenant riker are yet they seem to have trouble getting along with each another i have found that humans value their uniqueness that sense that they are different from every one else the existence of a double would preclude that feeling could that be the source of the friction
 they have restored the servo link to the core we can begin downloading the database
 computer activate automatic helm control
 did you help him with his research counsellor
 i thought it was a topic you were interested in
 i have a memory record of the entire lecture counsellor i can repeat the portions you missed if you
 it was not painful
 my memory record does not indicate a pause or disruption during that time period my internal chronometer and the ships computer are both perfectly synchronised there does not appear to be a temporal discrepancy
 you were motionless for three minutes eleven seconds
 aye sir
 captain may i see you
 the enterprise is not responding to our hails
 no sir
 aye sir
 we have an engine failure warning in the
 attitude control has been restored
 geordi i believe i have an explanation according to the plasma conversion sensor the starboard engine has been in continuous operation for forty seven days
 captain i am detecting a temporal disturbance intersecting the table it appears that within the disturbance time is moving at an accelerated rate approximately fifty times faster than normal the disturbance is spherical in shape it is extending outward from the hull approximately seventeen metres from the ship
 it does not appear to be affected
 course plotted adjust pitch to twenty seven point three degrees set heading one eight zero
 mark zero
 we are clearing the phenomenon
 all stop
 there is another temporal disturbance directly behind us
 within each disturbance it appears that time is moving at a different rate
 the fragmentation effect continues along a heading of two seven zero mark one five
 the fragmentation effect is increasing
 the enterprise and the warbird both appear to be trapped within one of the temporal fragments
 sensors cannot penetrate the subspace field i am unable to scan within the vessels
 it is impossible to tell from a visual inspection however it appears to be focused on the warbirds engineering section
 that would be inadvisable sir in each of the three instances we came into contact with one of the temporal fragments we were integrated into its time frame
 the emergency transporter armbands contain a type seven phase discriminator it should be possible to reconfigure their subspace emitters
 i will attempt to narrow the field sir
 counsellor
 captain the equipment is no longer functioning however the information currently displayed indicates that there was a massive power surge in engineering
 data to captain picard
 please come to engineering immediately it is urgent
 captain i believe i have found the cause of the power surge there is a warp core breach in progress
 it is the flashpoint of a warp core explosion and it is expanding
 we were incorrect sir i have determined that time is moving forward at an infinitesimal rate
 our initial conclusion was based on our observations of the crew a warp core breach moves at a much faster rate the motion of the cloud is within my visual detection threshold at its current expansion rate it will consume the enterprise in approximately nine hours seventeen minutes
 it is no longer a question of stopping it sir the explosion has already occurred the fact that it is moving slowly changes nothing
 no however the console displays indicate a power transfer in progress between the enterprise and the romulan ship at the moment time decelerated that is why there is a second beam between the two ships
 perhaps we should go aboard the romulan ship the answer to that question may
 captain
 in much the same way deep sea divers experience nitrogen narcosis you experienced a form of temporal narcosis
 this is highly unusual the crew is not at battle stations the ship is on evacuation alert
 perhaps the warbird was trying to destroy the enterprise
 geordi the engine core is completely inactive
 it appears to be a highly focused aperture in the spacetime continuum its energy signature matches that of the temporal fragments we observed earlier however it is approximately one point two million times as intense i believe this may be the origin of the temporal fragmentation
 i am not certain they exhibit a complex bioelectric patterns very possibly organic
 from the molecular configuration it appears tricorder beeps the aperture is beginning to fluctuate i believe
 i believe my tricorder emissions caused the temporal aperture to activate i suggest we avoid exposing it to any
 further energy emissions
 they may have been attempting to eject their engine core
 we must get him to the runabout
 yes but i am getting unusual readings from his bioscan i am not sure he is a romulan
 his cellular structure does not conform to any known species his bioelectric patterns are in a state of temporal flux i do not believe that this being is native to our time continuum
 correct sir
 this is a biospectral analysis of the temporal aperture the organic readings originated from these dark spots
 its bioelectric patterns are similar to those of the aliens however they are significantly less complex its cellular structure appears to be in a state of mitosis
 it is possible if i could further scan the aperture it might be possible to
 his molecular structure is destabilising
 captain i believe the aliens mistook the artificial singularity which the romulans use in their engine for a natural one a black hole they tried to use it as a nest
 when the power transfer came into contact with the alien nest i believe it disrupted the spacetime continuum
 i estimate the core breach will consume the enterprise in approximately seven hours two minutes
 no sir we would have to surround the core with a subspace isolation field it is not possible to generate a field of that magnitude from the runabout
 correct sir
 i could attempt to remodulate the tricorders deltaband emissions it should be possible to better control the temporal aperture
 i have reached engineering captain standing by
 initiating tricorder emissions
 captain
 the warp core breach has been reversed sir
 aye sir
 do not initiate that power transfer
 we must shut it down
 computer place a level three containment field around the warp core
 i was attacked by another alien sir i was unable to prevent the power transfer it cannot be disengaged sir a core breach is again imminent
 the core breach has been prevented sir
 the alien who attacked me has vanished sir
 judging from the residual temporal fluctuations i believe they have returned to their own time continuum
 come in
 spot is sleeping sir why do you ask
 understood sir
 recent events have compelled me to study how humans perceive the passage of time for example i have often heard people comment that time seems to pass more slowly in one instance or more quickly in another in reality the actual passage of time remains fixed
 i have been testing the aphorism a watched pot never boils i have boiled the same amount of water in this kettle sixty two times in some cases i have ignored the kettle in others i have watched it intently in every instance the water reaches its boiling point in precisely fifty one point seven seconds it would appear that i am not capable of perceiving time any differently than my internal chronometer
 sir
 thank you sir i will try that
 quite amusing doctor hawking you see sir isaac the joke depends on an understanding of the relativistic curvature of spacetime if two noninertial reference frames are in relative motion
 that story is generally considered to be apocryphal
 when i play poker with my shipmates it often appears to be a useful forum for exploring the different facets of humanity i was curious to see how three of historys greatest minds would interact in this setting so far it has proved most illuminating
 i fold as well
 we will have to continue this another time end programme
 it does not appear to be attacking the outpost sir
 there is a great deal of electromagnetic interference i am unable to determine whether there are any lifeforms present
 electromagnetic interference is still making it difficult to get a precise reading
 the mechanism appears to be jammed sir
 i have bypassed the primary system
 angry stop it stop stop stop stop stop
 yes sir
 i got angry
 my internal diagnostic also finds nothing wrong
 i agree geordi i believe ive experienced my first emotion
 you are correct in that i have no frame of reference to confirm my hypothesis in fact i am unable to provide a verbal description of the experience perhaps you could describe how it feels to be angry i could then use that as a reference
 could you describe feeling hostile
 could you describe feeling angry without referring to other feelings
 that was my experience as well i simply felt angry
 i do not know perhaps i have evolved to the point where emotions are within my grasp perhaps i will experience other emotions as time goes by
 for the past six hours i have attempted to produce an emotional response by subjecting myself to various stimuli
 i listened to several operas known to be uplifting i watched three holodeck programs designed to be humourous and i made four attempts to induce sexual desire by subjecting myself to erotic imagery
 nothing
 anger is a negative emotion i wanted to concentrate on something more positive
 but my study of humanity indicates there are some emotions that are harmful such as jealousy or hatred
 but what if it does counsellor what if it turns out that those are the only emotions i am capable of experiencing would that not make me a bad person
 i wish i were as confident as you counsellor when i was fighting the borg i felt angry but when i think back on the incident i realise that i was also experiencing another sensation it was not the same as anger but i think it was an emotion
 it was just after i had killed the borg i looked down at his body i felt something
 i believe it was pleasure
 stop it stop stop stop stop stop
 yes but it is all right do you need me
 i believe i am able to resume my duties
 i am attempting to recreate the experience which caused to my initial burst of anger
 none so far i have almost completed this experiment may i finish before we return to engineering
 computer reset borg simulation to time index two point one increase borg strength by twenty percent run programme
 stop it stop stop stop stop computer reset simulation to time index two point one increase borg strength by thirty percent
 geordi the computer will require the voice authorisations of two senior officers in order to disable the safety routine will you help me
 during the original incident the borg presented a genuine danger to my life since the holodeck safety routine is in place i know my life is not in danger since i am trying to duplicate the conditions of the original incident as closely as possible i must also attempt to duplicate the jeopardy as well
 this experiment may hold the key to something i have sought all my life
 i have tried other stimuli but they have been unsuccessful i understand your objections but it is my life and i have a right to risk it if i choose
 captain we are nearing the ms system
 sensors are detecting a subspace distortion forming directly ahead of the borg ship
 impulse engines are now at one hundred twenty five percent
 we appear to be caught in some kind of energy matrix
 we are being pulled inside
 main power is offline i am switching to backups
 we have returned to normal space navigational systems are still offline i will attempt to make a celestial fix using secondary systems
 captain this one is still alive
 aye sir
 i do not wish to be assimilated
 yes on ohniaka three i was forced to kill a borg i got angry
 it would be unethical to take pleasure from another beings death
 yes
 no that is not correct my creator doctor soong gave me a programme which defines my sense of right and wrong in essence i have a conscience
 step away from the forcefield your proximity is interfering with my scan
 it was a very potent experience
 yes
 no that would not be ethical
 yes his name is geordi
 yes i would
 the sons of soong have joined together and together we will destroy the federation
 stop stop stop
 it was just after i had killed the borg i felt something i believe it was pleasure
 the sons of soong have joined together and together we will destroy the federation
 you are wrong captain my brother and i serve a much higher purpose
 yes my brother has made that possible
 do not try to drive a wedge between us captain i am loyal to my brother
 hugh interfaced with the others and transferred his sense of individuality to them it nearly destroyed them
 the borg aspire to the perfection my brother and i represent fully artificial life forms we are their future
 taking the comm badges i now realise that my life aboard the enterprise was a waste my quest to become human was misguided an evolutionary step in the wrong direction
 there are no other emotions
 counsellor troi told me herself that feelings are not negative or positive it is how we act on them that makes them good or bad
 you simply do not understand in a quest such as ours sacrifices have to be made it is regrettable but the greater good must be served give me your visor
 give it to me or i will take it by force
 i am not your puppet anymore
 here is the visor may i ask why you wanted it
 all the borg you have experimented on so far have suffered extensive brain damage
 i understand
 that is not your concern
 as picard geordi
 shh were getting out of here
 as himself too late my brother suggested that i try to develop my sense of humour what do you think
 im attemptin to neutralise your pain receptors
 i am implanting nanocortical fibres in your cerebrum they are designed to learn and mimic your neural firing patterns once they are in place i will destroy the existing brain cells well see if the artificial neural network is able to take over your cognitive functions
 if the procedure is successful your cognitive processing functions will be considerably improved
 however there is a sixty percent chance you will not survive the procedure
 they are cause for concern however i still have counsellor troi and captain picard the odds are that at least one of the procedures will be successful
 drop it or i will break his neck
 take him
 i will be back for him later
 i have a complete memory record of that day
 i did not have enough buoyancy to get back to the surface
 one kilometre forty six metres
 i am ready to irradiate your existing brain cells
 i am getting some anomalous readings from your neural net i will need to do further testing before i proceed someone will come and take you back to your cell
 it is too early to tell if the nanocortical fibres performed their function
 they came looking for me
 i betrayed them if they die i am responsible
 i do not want you to check my systems i must resolve these issues myself
 i do not like it
 yes
 yes please i want more
 thank you
 i did not come for him i came for you
 that would not be possible
 it is for the greater good
 that is correct
 you are attempting to confuse me
 no that would be wrong
 holding a weapon lore
 what are you doing
 lore i must deactivate you now
 i know but you leave me no other choice
 goodbye lore
 lore is no longer functioning sir he must be disassembled so that he is no longer a threat
 thank you sir
 enter
 i am relieved that the injuries i inflicted on you are not permanent
 this is the chip my father created for me so that i could experience emotions i had it removed from lores body before he was dismantled
 no i am pleased to say it was damaged when i was forced to fire on lore
 yes but emotions were responsible for what i did to you i would never risk letting that happen again my friendship with you is too important to me
 how is your diplomatic assignment progressing
 i have heard that in moments of diplomatic tension it is often helpful to find elements of commonality
 you share all of those qualities in abundance perhaps you should try to build on your similarities
 the interface unit is operating within expected parameters
 no one else has reported so complete a sensory experience
 apparently the tactile sensors are too low i will increase the input
 it provides tactile sensations so that geordi can feel hes in the same environment as the probe
 i have reviewed the vessels mission plans the raman was to descend to the lower atmosphere eleven thousand kilometres below its current position the crew was to sample the atmosphere at that level and then return to a safer orbit
 the probe sends information via a focused particle beam it should be able to cut through the interference
 yes sir
 aye sir i will be on the bridge
 we are ready to bring the interface online sir
 activating the remote sensors initiating interface now
 do you have visual contact
 acknowledged
 increasing signal strength to seventy five percent of tolerance
 what is your position
 a magnetic storage bay
 come in
 no i have completed the adjustments on the interface i am now waiting for commander riker to finish moving the probe do you need to be comforted
 i am using the time to catch up on my study of poetry
 that is not entirely correct while it is true the display is currently blank this emptiness has a poetic meaning therefore it cannot be considered nothing as such
 the ancient doosodarians much of their poetry contained such lacunae or empty spaces often these pauses measured several days in length during which poet and audience were encouraged to fully acknowledge the emptiness of the experience
 are you certain you do not wish to talk about your mother
 you are no doubt feeling emotional distress as a result of her disappearance while you claim to be just passing by that is most likely an excuse to start a conversation about this uncomfortable subject am i correct
 then i apologise for my premature assumption this particular poem has a lacuna of forty seven minutes you may experience the emptiness with me if you wish
 i do not understand
 my initial assumption was correct you do wish to speak of your mother
 your sanity is not in question however your evaluation of the available information is biased
 disappearances fitting the profile of the hera have rarely ended with the safe recovery of ship and crew
 i am not offended you are upset your reactions are not surprising
 the input levels are currently at fifty three percent of tolerance
 initiating interface
 i am increasing the input now
 is this level sufficient geordi geordi do you hear me
 the cut off has been automatically activated
 geordi i have analysed the probes sensor logs there are no record to indicate the presence of a living human on board the raman
 we have no indication of a transmission of any kind
 the probe does allow geordi to sense quantum fluctuations subspace anomalies and other phenomenon not perceptible by any other kind of sensors
 if the hera is on the surface its hull could not possibly withstand the pressure of the atmosphere
 data here
 aye sir
 barradas three is the only class m planet in this system and it is listed as unpopulated however sensors have detected intermittent energy signals emanating from its surface
 the planet was used as an outpost for the debrune approximately two thousand years ago the federations archaeological survey has catalogued numerous ruins on the surface
 aye sir commander as acting first officer i must question your decision to accompany the away team if captain picard were here
 i realise that sir but if he were and he wanted to lead an away team you would tell him that the captains place is
 is there a malfunction
 what is the source
 bridge to transporter room two can you get a lock on the away team
 data to away team please respond
 why was it not detected earlier
 raise shields red alert
 damage report
 take us to warp nine and pursue lock phasers on target
 increase the sensor field bandwidth patch in the lateral sensor arrays
 plot a course and take us back to barradas three notify the away team to prepare for transport
 starfleet intelligence confirms that a ship matching this configuration has been linked to raids on several other planets in this sector for the short time it was within our visual range we were able to take sensor readings of the mercenary vessel it appears to be encased in an energy absorbing material although we can see the ship this energy sheath renders it virtually undetectable to our long range sensors
 without a full compositional analysis of the energy sheath the chances of finding the correct remodulation sequence are remote
 on the contrary lieutenant that is precisely what we must do since there are no viable alternatives we will return to the surface and attempt to determine what these mercenaries are doing on this planet an investigation might reveal some indication of their purpose please notify me when you have assembled your search teams dismissed
 perhaps these artefacts have a special value to the romulans
 these structures were built by the debrune that race is an ancient offshoot of the romulans the ruins on the planet where captain picard was killed were also romulan in origin
 the question remains why are they stealing these artefacts
 there are several archaeological sites in this sector containing ruins which are romulan in origin these are the locations that were attacked by the mercenary vessel
 the only sites not been attacked were on calder two yadalla prime and draken four
 that would be their next likely target
 but it is only a small science station it has limited defensive capabilities i do not believe it could withstand an attack from the mercenary ship mister worf send a message to the federation outpost on calder two advise them that if a ship matching the mercenary vessel approaches they should attempt to delay it until our arrival ensign take us out of orbit set course for the calder system warp nine
 ensign scan for starfleet combadge signals is commander riker aboard that ship
 open a channel
 this is the federation starship enterprise you are ordered to stand down
 drop your shields and prepare to be boarded
 commander are you all right
 that is impossible sir the ship you are on has violated a federation outpost it is my duty to stop it
 commander if you could explain
 that is correct counsellor he does know mister worf prepare to drop the shields
 i am aware of that
 mister worf that is an order
 mister worf prepare to drop shields
 i am aware of that
 i believe you are right counsellor it is now up to us to play along release inertial dampers and cut power to decks thirty one through thirty seven
 set phasers to twenty five percent return fire
 i am aware of the tactical situation lieutenant let them go
 i agree the existence of such a message is remote but i believe we should check
 inform starfleet command that we will hold this position until further notice
 yes but we will continue to pursue all avenues of investigation
 that is correct but i believe commander riker wanted us to let them escape
 possibly i will attempt to resequence the signal begin running a search for a decryption key
 i have completed my analysis of the signal from the mercenary ship i believe these groupings represent bearings and coordinates taken from their navigational system
 yes if i am correct the mercenary ship is heading toward these coordinates in the hyralan sector
 make it so
 lieutenant may i see you in the ready room
 lieutenant i am dissatisfied with your performance as first officer
 you continually question my orders in front of the crew i do not believe this is appropriate behaviour
 that is true but in those situations you were acting as head of security not as first officer the primary role of the second in command is to carry out the decisions of the captain in this case me
 yes but once i have made a decision it is your job to carry it out regardless of how you may personally feel any further objections should be given to me in private not in front of the crew i do not recall commander riker ever publicly showing irritation with his captain as you did a moment ago
 if you do not feel capable of carrying out this role i will assign it to commander la forge and return you to tactical i would not enter it into your record as a reprimand simply as a transfer
 then i expect you to conform to the guidelines i have laid out
 dismissed mister worf i am sorry if i have ended our friendship
 i would like that as well
 is it the mercenary ship
 open a channel this is lieutenant commander data of the federation starship enterprise
 i take it that is your name may i inquire as to your destination
 may i ask the purpose of your journey
 perhaps i have not made our intentions clear we are investigating
 he seems most uncooperative
 according to the terms of the klingonfederation treaty koral has every right to free transit through federation space we cannot board or search his vessel without cause
 i am not sure that using this clause as an excuse to conduct a search would be consistent with the spirit of the treaty
 however if koral wishes to contest our actions he can file a protest with the judge advocate generals office bring the shuttle aboard then you and doctor crusher can begin the inspection
 lieutenant worf has programmed our replicators to make a very good approximation of klingon bloodwine i believe you will find it to your liking
 if you could tell us something about the nature of your mission
 commander riker by taking this action you risk charges of assault theft piracy and treason
 security alert medical emergency team to the observation lounge data to bridge raise shields and begin sensor sweeps for the mercenary ship
 i must admit i am experiencing a similar sensation
 what will become of the resonator sir
 it is unfortunate it cannot be studied the resonator is a key artefact from a remarkable period of history
 if we are to adhere to the exact letter of starfleet regulations then technically sir you have been declared a renegade in fact i believe you are facing twelve counts of court martial offences you cannot give orders either sir
 aye sir
 taking rikers arm this way sir
 i will go to deck twenty and begin modifications
 excuse me do you have authorisation to work in this area you are dismantling a warp plasma conduit i must ask you to stop
 geordi have you ever had a nightmare
 i have had one hundred eleven dreams since i first discovered this programme nine months ago in all of that time i have never experienced such strange and disturbing imagery i believe it was a nightmare
 perhaps i have also noted that i am spending an inordinate amount of time thinking about nightmare imagery one could almost say i am preoccupied
 geordi you do not seem to appreciate ensign tylers enthusiasm
 i do not understand
 you do not share her affection
 i believe i understand you are concerned about unintentionally hurting ensign tylers feelings
 it would appear that you require a third party to intervene on your behalf i will be happy to speak to her
 geordi when i first awoke from my nightmare there was a brief moment when i
 captain i am taking the warpcoil engines offline
 enter
 counsellor
 i have been watching spot sleep in the past fifteen minutes he has had twelve muscles spasms which indicates he was dreaming i have often wondered what spot dreams about his twitching and his rapid breathing would seem to suggest anxiety but spot has never seen a mouse or any other form of rodentia he has never encountered an insect or been chased by a canine
 that was very thoughtful of him ive been debating whether or not to initiate another dream sequence
 i have found them to be quite unsettling
 thank you counsellor i believe i will initiate a dream programme now
 goodnight counsellor goodnight spot
 computer dim lights
 what kind of cake are you eating
 no thank you excuse me mister worf
 sir
 yes sir
 please identify yourselves i must know what you are trying to highpitched sound
 i am sorry counsellor
 what is wrong
 my internal chronometer was supposed to wake me thirty five minutes ago
 that is not possible something is wrong
 i will compare my autonomic logs with the ships chronometer perhaps we have overlooked something
 it is a possibility however i would prefer to make certain there are no anomalies in my neural net
 i have not fully assimilated its impact i would prefer to study the images further before discussing them
 strange is not a sufficient adjective to describe the experience
 it is difficult to explain counsellor trois body was a cake
 it had a black handle and a serrated blade and it was quite long
 twenty five centimetres in length
 one of the workmen pointed to her right shoulder at that moment i had an overwhelming urge to cut a piece out of the cake
 yes as i began slicing the cake she reacted as though i was causing her pain yet i could not stop cutting that is when i woke up doctor freud i am curious
 i am curious what do my nightmares mean
 i do not understand
 but i do not have a mother
 but i have no sexual desire
 i do not believe i am being helped by this session
 that will not be necessary computer end programme
 the warp field has collapsed sir
 it appears ensign tyler still has a crush on you it is clear you did not speak to her
 i am reminded of a recent dream this brace is reminiscent of
 hello
 i do not know
 everything seems to remind me of the nightmare objects sounds smells and now i have seen elements of the dream in a waking state i cannot explain it
 i have run three complete self diagnostics all of my systems are functioning normally perhaps doctor freud was correct the knife i dreamed about is the embodiment of my unconscious desire to inflict violence
 that is not possible
 do you really think it is possible
 daily
 thank you counsellor i look forward to our next meeting
 i am currently running a level three diagnostic of the relays sir we will have the results of the analysis in approximately ten minutes
 hold very still counsellor
 i believe i had another waking dream sir but this time i had an uncontrollable urge to eliminate the image i saw
 yes sir for a reason i cannot explain i had the need to destroy it
 no sir i saw a straw coming out of your head
 as i said before these are all images i originally experienced in my dream programme i do not have a rational explanation for them
 a sensible precaution sir
 of course hands over the phaser may i ask a personal favour
 will you take care of spot for me
 i am afraid if i have another waking dream i might injure him
 unlike a canine spot does not respond to verbal commands hands him to worf who holds him at arms length goodbye spot he will need to be fed once a day he prefers feline supplement number twenty five
 and he will require water and you must provide him with a sand box and you must talk to him tell him he is a pretty cat and a good cat
 perhaps that will be enough
 it is an interesting hypothesis if i am being affected by these interphasic creatures on an unconscious level it may also explain my waking dreams and my subsequent antisocial behaviour
 i see the concept is similar to the method of directed dreaming
 yes sir
 i understand sir initiating dream programme stand by
 hello
 cake
 it is cellular peptide cake
 stop you must not hurt my friends
 i believe i understand
 geordi
 you must adjust my positronic subprocessor to emit an interphasic pulse
 the workmen in my dreams represent the organisms which are trying to demolish the ship the incessant ringing of the telephone freuds cautions at the other end were warnings of the dangers around us
 my positronic subprocessor detected high frequency interphasic signatures from the organisms which were symbolically represented in my dreams by a high shriek
 that is why i have asked geordi to adjust my subprocessor if i can produce a high frequency interphasic pulse it may have a similar effect on the creatures
 enter
 counsellor i did not have a chance to apologise for my actions
 i wonder what would doctor freud say about the symbolism of devouring oneself
 it is often the case that children learn languages more easily than adults
 mrs troi
 perhaps we are being too literal i have recently learned in my study of dream analysis that people who appear in a dream can sometimes represent different aspects of the person who is dreaming
 there is nothing wrong with the transporter i have run a complete diagnostic of all the targeting components
 a concentration of antigraviton particles suggests a tractor beam it might have deflected the transporter beam to a different set of coordinates
 the tractor beam originated somewhere in the prytt alliance
 i have scanned the entire prytt communications system this appears to be the primary access module for the central government
 i believe so sir however the prytt have no link designed for extraterritorial communication our hail may come as a quite surprise to them
 no sir
 geordi
 why is spot under the bed
 has spot been misbehaving
 these incidents are common to cat owners when you borrowed spot you said you wanted to experience the full range of feline behaviour before getting a cat yourself
 spot does not respond to verbal commands
 i never found it to be necessary
 i have never experienced this kind of behaviour in spot although she does have the unfortunate habit of jumping on my computer console when i am working
 i do not think it would be wise to startle her
 the unusually intense tetryon fields in this sector pose a severe navigational hazard to warp driven vessels the hekaras corridor is the only route through the area which is free of tetryon fields ships travelling at warp must use the corridor to ensure safe passage through the region
 at least two days sir the corridor is over twelve light years long and the surrounding tetryon interference will limit our sensor range
 geordi there has been a slight drop in sensor efficiency perhaps we should examine the phase buffers
 is there a problem with the engines
 then why are you stabilizing the eps conduit
 but that would not affect the engines in any way
 what is the point
 why
 yes
 i understand you are in competition with mister kaplan
 then you are trying to outperform the intrepid
 one moment the phase buffer is functioning within normal parameters sensor efficiency has increased by six point seven percent
 geordi i have taken your suggestion regarding spot
 i have begun training her
 yes i am studying several new techniques
 i began with simple conditioned response exercises and followed with environmental enhancement next i plan to explore bioconditioning devices
 such as sensor nets for behaviour modification or biofeedback motivators unfortunately i have been less than successful
 geordi i cannot stun my cat
 clearly there is a misalignment somewhere in this system
 i am somewhat concerned that my training efforts will ultimately fail
 i have consulted numerous animal training manuals some of them claim that cats are inherently untrainable
 what did she train her cat to do
 interesting perhaps i could modify your sisters techniques to keep spot from jumping on console do you know how she was able to train her cat
 phase alignment is stabilised however sensor efficiency has increased by only an additional one point three percent
 data here
 acknowledged sir we are on our way
 that is correct sir their impulse system is down as well power generation is at extremely low levels
 life support systems are also functioning at low levels there are approximately four hundred fifty ferengi on board that is a standard complement for a ship of that class
 it would also explain the failure of their warp drive
 direct hit their weapon systems are down
 sir the ferengi ships power has stabilised they appear to have impulse capability
 spot spot spot down spot down down spot lifting the cat off the desk down this is down down is good this is up up is no
 to spot one moment come in
 i would be happy to
 it is part of her training programme i am teaching spot to jump down from the desk on my command
 i have not been entirely successful
 feline supplement number two twenty one
 i suppose i must accept that possibility it may be that spot lacks the intelligence necessary to learn the appropriate responses to my commands
 this procedure will only increase the conversion level by point eight percent
 enough
 la forge i got the intrepids power conversion levels up to ninety seven point one percent maybe you should try cleaning your plasma grid once in a while
 we perform maintenance on the plasma grid at regular intervals
 unknown sir it does not appear in any federation charts of the corridor
 it is a possibility the debris consists primarily of duranium and polycomposite fragments which suggest a ship furthermore the field contains sufficient mass to account for the fleming
 captain i am picking up a small metallic object approximately three point five metres in diameter
 i do not believe so it is emitting an unusual signal captain it is beginning to generate a verteron field
 unidentified ship heading toward us two life forms are aboard
 captain they are initiating their transporter system
 captain we are being boarded
 serova and rabal believe there are regions of potential subspace instability within the corridor they believe that if these regions continue to be exposed to warp field energy they will rupture subspace will extrude into normal space forming a rift
 that analogy is essentially correct sir
 not at this time sir there is insufficient evidence to do so in order to determine whether or not a rift will form region must be exposed to warp field energy approximately one million times greater than that normally generated by a starship
 i agree that is a possibility captain i suggest we ask the federation science council to send a research vessel to this area a more detailed investigation would resolve many of our questions
 captain the hekaran ships engines are beginning to overload i believe serovas attempting to create a warp core breach
 we have cleared the shock wave however tetryon flux in the area is increasing rapidly
 the event is approximately zero point one light years in diameter and it is emitting extremely high levels of tetryon radiation it appears to be what rabal and serova predicted a subspace rift
 scanning the fleming is near its previous coordinates it appears to be intact but it is now within the rift
 if we maintain our current position our shields should provide sufficient protection
 the waves are even more intense within the rift i estimate her shields will fail in approximately twelve hours
 doctor is it possible there are areas inside the rift which are stable where we can safely use our warp engines
 that should not be possible
 i am not certain that is true i believe i have an idea
 i suggest we coast into the rift
 we can initiate a brief high intensity warp pulse from our current position we should be able to attain sufficient velocity to enter the rift beam the crew off the fleming and exit without using our warp engines
 if we field saturate the nacelles we should be able to sustain warp speed for approximately two minutes
 the timing will be critical
 aye sir
 i believe the maximum saturation level should be eighteen point three percent
 i agree but based on the size of the rift it should give us sufficient time to complete the rescue computer initiate nacelle field saturation
 i beg your pardon
 technically geordi we were not wrong serovas theories rested on assumptions which were unprovable
 by using methods any reputable scientist would never employ
 we reviewed serovas research to the best of our abilities and we were prepared to continue studying the problem but that was not satisfactory
 i do not believe that you would have resorted to such extremes
 perhaps because her aggressive methods created an adversarial situation
 i do not understand
 captain warp pulse calculations are complete we will be firing the engines at maximum intensity for six point three seconds before disengaging
 engines disengaged we are now entering the rift rumble hull stress is increasing eighty three percent of maximum tolerance and rising
 captain if they activate
 they are badly damaged sir their life support systems are failing
 captain when the fleming activated their warp drive the rift expanded by two point three percent we no longer have sufficient momentum to escape
 distortion wave intensity has increased by a factor of ten
 distortion waves occurring every fifty nine seconds hull stress is nearing maximum tolerance
 i do not believe so sir and the resulting explosion would likely destroy the saucer section in the process
 the next distortion wave will impact in fourteen seconds
 ten seconds
 we were unable to maintain phase match with the distortion wave sir
 another distortion wave approaching impact in twenty six seconds
 captain i suggest we take the ship to full impulse if we can attain sufficient speed it will lessen the shock when the wave hits
 distortion wave impact in five seconds
 we are now within the distortion wave hull stresses have exceeded maximum tolerance
 approximately twelve seconds sir hull stresses one hundred twenty percent above tolerance
 we have cleared the rift sir hull stress has returned to normal
 the only permanent solution would be to reliquefy the core
 the procedure will involve using the ships phasers to drill down through the planets surface into the pockets where we would set up a series of plasma infusion units
 it should be possible to stabilise the core temperature at ninety three percent of normal
 yes doctor
 you are doctor juliana tainer
 have we met before
 you were a colleague of doctor soong
 doctor i have no memory of you
 my memory record begins when i was activated by the starfleet officers on the omicron theta outpost
 yes all of the inhabitants of the colony were killed however i discovered that my memory banks contained the contents of their journals and logs
 my childhood
 so you wiped my memory processors after this childhood
 doctor i have scanned the journals of the colonists there is only one juliana mentioned in them her last name was odonnell
 but there was no mention that my father was married to you
 my father did have an unusual way of looking at things
 i encountered him once in the terlina system
 it was shortly before his death
 yes
 what do you mean
 this has been an interesting encounter and an altogether unexpected one i would like to corroborate your story before we proceed further excuse me doctor
 inform me when you are ready
 i am attempting to ascertain whether doctor tainers story is true
 i neither believe nor doubt i am simply attempting to verify her assertions
 the registrars office on mavala four cannot confirm whether doctor soong was married there apparently many of the documents were lost when the government was overthrown
 i am checking passenger manifests to see if they went to mavala during the period in question odonnell juliana soong noonian they were both passengers on a transport which travelled from omicron theta to mavala and returned four days later
 still the fact that they went to mavala does not prove they were married there
 not at all i am merely unable to reconcile her story with the fact that my father never mentioned her to me
 yes it is possible that those are memories of my childhood and of mrs soong
 i can think of no motive for such a pretense
 that is true
 i admit i am finding it difficult to accept the possibility of a past about which i know nothing but it is also true that i am curious to learn more about it
 i would like to get to know you better mother
 how did you decide
 yes
 pleased
 you misunderstand counsellor troi is a therapist
 we will be in position over the drilling site in three minutes twenty nine seconds
 these scans indicate that the magma pockets where we plan to set up the infusion units are somewhat unstable
 thank you geordi
 i am incapable of embarrassment please continue
 my calculations indicate
 the first phaser blast will be approximately nineteen seconds in duration
 we are within two kilometres of the magma pocket
 i detect no increase in the stress levels of the surrounding magma
 the drilling process has raised the temperature in the magma pockets by almost three hundred degrees celsius it will be several hours before it cools enough for us to enter
 i do not
 thank you i will be playing this piece at a recital tomorrow evening
 i have been told that my playing is technically flawless but no one has described it as beautiful
 are you certain you are not saying this because you are my mother i have noticed that parents tend to exaggerate when it comes to their childrens accomplishments
 i do not know for certain but i believe it is during my creative endeavours that i come closest to experiencing what it must be like to be human
 as am i
 i would like that very much
 i could replicate one for you computer please replicate one viola
 yes i am attempting to master all known styles of painting this one is in the style of the early french impressionists
 that is lal my daughter
 i created her using myself as a model
 the positronic matrix i designed for her was unstable she only lived a short time
 in a sense you were her grandmother would you like to practice now
 the acoustics in ten forward are most favourable
 of course
 perhaps i created lal because i wished to procreate despite what happened to her i still have that wish
 i was not aware he created other androids before my brother
 i am that android are you saying you were against my creation
 then why did you never attempt to contact me
 perhaps if you told me what has made you feel this way it may alleviated the guilt
 we are within four kilometres of the magma pocket
 if we do we will have to begin a new shaft at a suitable location
 i am detecting no signs of
 instability
 acknowledged
 i have initialised the plasma induction coils
 i am incapable of anger
 i am not certain i do perhaps you could clarify them for me
 if i had been your biological offspring would you have left me on omicron theta
 doctor tainer i get the impression you are trying to spare my feelings i assure you that is not necessary
 is that because you place more value on biological life than on artificial life
 i do thank you for making it clear to me
 i was hoping you would be able to determine that from her transporter trace pattern
 doctor i would ask that you not require me to be more specific i assure you i have a good reason for asking
 i see
 she has not complained of any discomfort
 because i have reason to believe she is not who she claims to be
 go ahead sir
 on my way excuse me doctor
 acknowledged
 there will be more seismic activity we must hurry
 the shaft has not been obstructed by the seismic activity it should be possible to trigger the unit from orbit
 priming the energytransfer matrix
 go ahead sir
 understood sir we will attempt to expedite our work
 yes sir well be returning to the beamout point shortly
 no we are too far below the surface
 there are no handholds in the rock face we are going to have to jump
 you will
 check her positronic matrix there may be a cascade anomaly
 the first indication occurred when we were digging i saw her perform complex calculations without the assistance of the computer
 that is true but it was enough to get my attention later i noticed something odd about the way she blinked her eyes the intervals between blinks were governed by the fourier system the same mathematical formula my father used to give my blinking pattern the appearance of randomness
 then there was the concert in ten forward
 we had practised the piece and i noticed that she played it the same way during the performance every pitch every intonation was exactly the same only an artificial life form could have done that
 i do not believe so he is on the surface monitoring the plasma infusion
 it appears to be an information module with a holographic interface
 that is correct
 i am data
 i am fine
 you refer to doctor tainer as my mother yet the complexity of her design indicates she was created after i was
 what happened to her
 then you never told her the truth
 what happened
 if she recovers and learns that she is an android
 then you do not believe she should know the truth
 it seems that i must make a decision whether to tell doctor tainer that she is an android or to withhold that information from her i do not know what to do
 he seemed certain that if she knew it would preclude the possibility of her being happy
 i am not certain i understand why my father felt as he did but his wishes are not necessarily paramount i am more concerned with what would be best for her
 i find i am having difficulty separating what would be best for her from what would be best for me
 if she knew she were an android we would have something to share i would no longer be alone in the universe
 you were knocked unconscious by the fall you broke a bone in your arm but doctor crusher repaired it everything is fine
 perhaps i can visit atrea on my next leave
 there is something i thought you should know my father told me that he had only one great love in his life and that he regretted never telling her how much he cared for her i am certain he was referring to you
 goodbye mother energise
 happy birthday worf
 yes i have entered my expressionistic phase this is my interpretation of the battle of haros
 the array appears to be functioning normally sir
 the array is still transmitting data sir but it is no longer sending that information to the federation it appears someone has redirected its imaging systems
 sector one nine six five eight sir i am unable to access its main computer so it is impossible to determine the exact location
 lieutenant worf please report to engineering
 we have analysed the imaging logs it appears the array was reprogrammed to observe several federation sites
 that is our theory we believe unauthorised access was made six days ago the imaging logs from that day show a ship approaching the array
 lieutenant are you all right
 lieutenant have you completed the metallurgical scan of the array
 the metallurgical scan have you completed it
 i know of no such logs
 direct hit engineering section and deck forty two shield generators are overloading
 captain we have sustained heavy damage to the deflector systems hull breaches on decks seventeen and thirty six
 i am initiating a subspace scan to search for temporal anomalies on or off the ship
 with blue eyes two years one month and twelve days
 it is my understanding your romantic affiliation began shortly after you recovered from your spinal injury on stardate  it was six months later that you asked commander riker for his formal permission to court counsellor troi you felt to do otherwise would be dishonourable
 i am not privy to the exact details of when where or how your first coupling took place i could investigate it
 i am detecting no temporal anomalies in this system perhaps we should try to pinpoint the exact moment when events became discontinuous do you remember the first change
 think back are you sure that was the very first change
 we should try to find the commonalties in these events where were the people you were with
 it is possible we should speak to commander la forge
 doctor is geordi well enough to answer some questions
 there do not appear to be any unusual readings energy residuals from the plasma burns the beginnings of cellular decomposition i see nothing that connects these bioreadings to your recent sense of discontinuity
 i still see nothing unusual perhaps we should activate it
 the visor is active
 yellow eyes have you noticed another discontinuity
 i am detecting a quantum flux in your cellular rna
 i do not know i will have to analyse these readings
 i have found the quantum flux in worfs cellular rna extends to the subatomic level it is asynchronous with normal matter in essence captain mister worf does not belong in our universe
 all matter in the universe resonates on a quantum level with a unique signature that signature is constant it cannot be changed through any known process it is the basic foundation of existence
 yes sir i cannot explain it it is as if he originates from a different quantum universe
 aye sir
 it appears to be a quantum fissure in the spacetime continuum
 the anomaly cannot be seen but i believe i can enhance it with a warp field to make it visible
 not from this distance sir i am also detecting an ion trail intersecting the phenomenon i believe it was left by a starfleet type six shuttlecraft
 i have an explanation sir
 i believe the quantum fissure we discovered is a fixed point across the space time continuum a keyhole which intersects many other quantum realities
 for any event there is an infinite number of possible outcomes our choices determine which outcomes will follow but there is a theory in quantum physics that all possibilities that can happen do happen in alternate quantum realities
 that is correct
 when worfs shuttlecraft came into contact with the quantum fissure i believe its warp engines caused a small break in the barriers between quantum realties worf was thrown into a state of quantum flux he immediately shifted into other realities
 exactly the visor uses a subspace field pulse i believe that whenever geordi came near worf the field pulse intensified the quantum flux and pushed worf into another reality
 an excellent idea lieutenant
 captain a bajoran ship is approaching
 the barriers between quantum realties are breaking down other realties are emerging into our own
 the rate of quantum incursions is increasing exponentially at this rate the sector will be completely filled with enterprises within three days
 perhaps if we can find the ship which that commander worfs quantum signature
 it was worfs shuttlecraft which traversed the fissure and weakened the barriers between quantum realities if he reenters the fissure in his original shuttle and emits a broad spectrum warp field it may be enough to seal the fissure and stop additional realities from emerging into our own
 in theory the act of sealing the fissure should restore the barriers between quantum states the ships would return to their own realities
 yes sir it matches commander worfs quantum signature precisely i have remodulated the shuttles engines to emit an inverse warp field you will need to activate the field at the precise moment you enter the fissure
 that is one possibility however the uncertainty principle dictates that time is a variable in this equation you may end up several days before the event or several days after there is no way to tell
 captain worf is entering the fissure
 captain we are approaching the devolin system
 no sir
 initiating sensor sweep of grid zero one
 scan of grid one five seven is complete i am moving to grid one five eight
 i have confirmed geordis readings the resonance signature is originating from somewhere beneath the asteroids surface
 this asteroid contains several deep chasms large enough for a starship to enter it is possible the pegasus drifted into the asteroids gravitational field and was pulled down into one of the fissures
 at least another six hours sir
 in order for the deception to succeed it would have to appear to be a natural phenomenon verteron particles are artificial in nature
 theoretically sir it should work
 aye sir initiating ionisation field pulse
 ionisation pulse complete
 the romulans are initiating a tachyon scan of the asteroid they have switched to their lateral sensor array beginning another scan
 the warbird has completed its sensor sweep
 they are moving out
 yes sir
 beginning sensor sweeps
 aye sir
 for the past several hours i have been scanning the area where we detected the resonance signature of the pegasus from the strength and polarity of the signature it would appear that most of the warp core is still intact
 i would recommend against it sir there may be gravimetric or magnetic fluctuations inside the asteroid which would overpower the engines of a shuttlecraft
 it is theoretically possible sir but i am unaware of any prior situations where a starship was taken so deeply inside a planetary body there may be unforeseen difficulties
 it is so noted sir
 we are now two kilometres beneath the surface
 sensors show that the ship is still intact however sixty five percent of it is contained within the asteroid
 yes sir i do not understand how this could have happened
 the starboard bulkhead of main engineering is contained within the rock face but most of its compartment is still intact
 i believe so sir the breach can be temporarily sealed by extending our shields
 the asteroids internal structure is highly unstable any attempt to cut through the rock could cause the entire chasm to collapse
 theoretically it is possible sir but it would take several hours to study the device and determine how to link it to our systems
 the planets atmosphere is dissipating sir intense plasmonic reactions are destroying it the stratosphere is already breaking down there are turbulent radiation storms across much of its surface i estimate that the planet will be uninhabitable in less than thirty eight hours
 atmospheric dissipation is a rare and essentially unpredictable event when it occurs it proceeds rapidly doctor rozhenko may not have had sufficient warning
 the dissipation effect is generating plasmonic energy bursts
 i do not believe so however we may experience intermittent system failures and power surges as a result
 captain atmospheric dissipation has accelerated over the past several hours i estimate the planets atmosphere will be completely gone within three minutes
 the mesosphere is gone plasmonic reactions are now beginning to break down the troposphere
 it appears the plasmonic reactions are continuing to interfere with our sensors
 i had sir i will attempt to engage additional filtering elements visual reestablished
 there appears to be an unusual power drain in the eps distribution net
 unknown sir it is difficult to localize
 it will take approximately nine and one half hours to complete the analysis
 that is correct sir
 these are the two planets which best match our search criteria draygo four features an unusually large temperate zone however it is within three light years of cardassian space
 the alternative is vacca six it is located in the cabral sector
 it offers a less hospitable climate than the boraalans are accustomed to however it would still appear to be the better choice do you disagree doctor
 it is a formidable responsibility
 doctor i do not believe we can offer any guarantees we can simply make the best choice we have at the moment
 data to bridge
 we have located a new home for the boraalans sir
 it is vacca six in the cabral sector
 we are in synchronous orbit above the beam down site sir
 the colonys aqueduct system is functioning normally as are the communication relays
 certainly
 i suggest we analyse the planets weather patterns to see if they have been affected i am reading unusually high humidity across the entire southern desert region and there is increasing cloud activity above the northern coastal area possibly the formation of a storm system
 i will run a diagnostic on the thermal regulators
 it began as a minor power fluctuation sir but the effect has spread throughout the control grid it has caused an unusual concentration of cumulonimbus activity above the colony
 there appears to be a condensed suspension of water vapour approximately one degree celsius
 i am unable to terminate the connection sir a feedback loop has formed in the transfer beam i will have to go to the substation and attempt to correct the problem from there
 i have analysed the control module in the primary weather control grid it appears the station is experiencing a system wide power failure
 excuse me sir you are dismantling the primary power conduit i must ask you to stop
 he is dead
 in the meantime governor you should expect the weather problems to continue
 that is correct
 i cannot identify the energy residual however it appears to have the same anaphasic signature as the power fluctuations we observed from the weather control system
 it is possible
 captain geordi and i have detected an energy residual with the same anaphasic signature as the one we found on ned quints body
 approximately seventeen kilometres from the centre of the colony sir it is coming from the cemetery
 aye sir
 the energy readings appear to be originating approximately two metres below the surface i believe they are concentrated within this burial site
 data to picard
 captain we have located the source of the energy residual it appears to be concentrated within felisa howards coffin
 i am reading definite signs of anaphasic energy in her body it appears to extend to the cellular level
 i suggest we run a deep tissue scan to look for any signs of
 the enemy is firing
 target is destroyed
 less than five thousand kilometres sir
 sir the pods life support system is failing
 we would need to boost the gain on the confinement beam by at least seven percent
 trying to imitate the words who are you what do you want
 whats wrong with you
 my name is garvin
 i do not know my name
 you asked if i knew my name i do not
 yes it is becoming easier
 goodbye
 i do not remember being in an accident
 i walked here from the mountains
 i have a clear memory of my journey
 i have no prior memory
 no
 yes
 radioactive
 that is what is written on the container
 evidently
 i do not know perhaps it is my name
 that is correct
 no but i cannot have indigestion since i have not eaten
 then what do you believe i am
 ice man
 then i am not ill
 thank you
 i am an ice man
 radioactive
 jayden that is acceptable
 i do not know
 you may be right but i do not wish to sell all the fragments they may provide a clue to my identity
 i believe the support structure on the anvil collapsed because some of the wood had rotted did i do something wrong garvin
 you have told me no one from the village has ever been to the vellorian mountains how can you be certain there are ferocious creatures there
 but no one has actually seen one
 i neither liked it nor disliked it i simply had no appetite
 where is your mother
 yes i do
 i do not believe that is correct
 i believe you are reasoning by analogy classifying objects and phenomena according to superficial observation rather than empirical evidence wood for example does not contain fire simply because it is combustible nor does it contain rock simply because it is heavy wood like any complex organic form is composed of thousands of different chemical compounds none of which is fire
 yes but i do not agree with talurs assessment although i do have gaps in my memory i know that fire is not an element
 garvin is correct you agreed on twenty
 with an increased focal length and an achromatic objective lens this instrument will have a higher effective magnification
 garvin with your permission i would like to begin my own investigation regarding the cause of your illness
 gia i would like you to accompany me to the village i will need some supplies
 i will use these materials to make the laboratory equipment i need to research your fathers illness
 i do not know first i must isolate the cause of the illness
 am i to understand that garvins illness has spread
 gia i think we should leave
 i am studying skin samples from gia and garvin in an attempt to isolate the cause of the illness
 yes she is also beginning to show signs of the illness
 it is a magnifying device based on your handheld instrument i have refined the design to increase the magnification level
 of course
 objects appear approximately five hundred times their normal size as you can see the cellular damage is quite extensive however based on interstitial transparency and membrane integrity i do not believe it is an infection or any other form of communicable disease
 at the moment i am looking for a common event or experience that gia garvin and skoran might have shared that could have a causal relationship to their illness
 yes but since the illness struck all three in a relatively short period of time it is reasonable to assume the experience is recent and unusual
 i am aware of that excuse me i am also open to the possibility that i may in some way be the causal factor however since you have had a great deal of contact with me and you show no signs of the sickness i tend to discount myself as a likely candidate
 i agree
 talur is correct you should rest i will attend to your father gia when did you begin wearing that pendant
 may i see it this is one of the metal fragments i sold to skoran
 i have coated this piece of cloth with the liquid which is used in lamps as you can see the cloth becomes luminescent when it is exposed to an energy source this pendant also appears to be an energy source
 i believe a stream of particles is emanating from the metallic pendant and hitting the cloth
 you will see there are i can even block them
 it would appear that this container was constructed of a material which absorbs or blocks the particles coming from the metal
 no it is empirical data i believe the fragments were originally placed in this container to protect people from accidental exposure the word radioactive may be a warning about the dangerous nature of the metal
 i will continue my experiment i would like you to gather all the pieces of metal in the village and place them in this container
 of course
 if you are referring to the illness you are partially correct however it is more complex than that the metal fragment which
 i do not know
 gia
 i do not know what i am but i am not like you
 no i am not
 i do not wish to frighten you
 i understand your reaction but i do not wish to harm you you or garvin or anyone else i only wish to help to find a cure for the illness i was very close i must to continue my work but it will take time how long until skoran and the others return
 then i must hurry
 gia i believe i have found the answer
 i believe so i tested this medicine on skin samples from your father they showed improvement so i administered this to him he is now recovering
 a compound i made which will neutralise the particles that are making you ill swallow this i must administer this to everyone in the village but i do not think they will trust me after what happened to skoran
 i am afraid they will not believe you either gia is the well in the town square the only source of water for this village
 this is very important are there any other sources of fresh water near the village
 then i will put this compound into the well water it may be diluted but it should still have enough potency to work
 i only wish to help
 i do not know i am surprised to find myself here i thought i was on barkon four
 i had located the crashed federation probe and collected the radioactive fragments i was attempting to download the sensor logs from the probes onboard computer there was a power surge i believe the surge overloaded my positronic matrix after that i have no memory until this moment looks at his clothes it appears i had an interesting time
 counsellor have you been promoted in my absence
 yes sir
 i have finished
 the dimensions are accurate to within one point three percent
 counsellor music is a collection of acoustic vibrations how can i reproduce a sound with clay
 acknowledged sir on my way
 based on its present trajectory the comet appears to have originated in the darsay system
 that is correct sir this object has been en route for eighty seven million years
 aye sir the comets outer shell is composed primarily of gaseous hydrogen and helium surrounding an icy mantle the inner core consists of heavier elements
 there is distortion within the comets inner core i believed we experienced an intense sensor echo
 i am attempting to do so now sir i have compensated for the effect sensors are reconfigured for a low intensity sweep we are still picking up some interference but the distortion is manageable at these settings the scan will be complete in thirty nine hours
 i followed your advice counsellor i used my imagination
 for some reason as i was shaping the clay the image of the mask was exceptionally clear in my mind the design seemed to flow quite naturally
 no counsellor
 i do not
 perhaps we should investigate this matter further
 i believe i recognise these symbols
 i do not know
 it is a possibility i do not believe my systems are currently impaired but i will run a full diagnostic to make certain
 boundary border road companion message messenger
 death
 i do not know sir the object is nearly solid it is composed primarily of fortanium and several unknown materials it is over eighty seven million years old
 captain i believe this object is an informational archive
 i do not know however i seem to have an intuitive understanding of its function
 it is a possibility sir i recommend we run a level one diagnostic of my positronic net immediately to determine if that is the case
 i suggest we examine the memory subsystem next
 i am not certain i am experiencing a curious sensation
 an impulse
 i do not know
 geordi what does it feel like when a person is losing his mind
 i do not know i am different
 okay
 masaka is waking
 captain ive been waiting for you you should feel honoured i dont usually wait for anyone
 masaka is waking
 i am not masaka i am ihat
 commander data you mean the one who was here
 hes gone who can say where
 picard to counsellor troi report to main engineering immediately
 i come from masakas city
 we are losing containment in the starboard nacelle tube
 aye sir
 the plasma venting system has engaged
 aye sir
 geordi would you agree that the instinct for selfpreservation is shared by most life forms
 that being the case i find it difficult to understand why someone would deliberately terminate their own existence
 i believe i understand i have been in a similar situation
 the first months following my activation were a difficult period for me there were many problems associated with my becoming sentient
 as i acquired new skills neural pathways would form replacing other less complex pathways it was very disorienting
 as my systems grew in complexity it became increasingly difficult to integrate new pathways into my existing neural net the probability of cascade failure grew with each additional pathway i came to the conclusion it would be safer and easier to shut myself down and start again
 in a way it would have been like committing suicide
 i decided against the procedure i chose instead to treat the problems i was having with my systems as challenges to overcome rather than obstacles to be avoided
 the shipyard where the enterprise was built
 lieutenant kwan was partially empathic
 no they were installed two years ago
 i am getting readings that indicate organic material embedded in this wall
 it appears counsellor was correct pierce was partially telepathic his maternal grandmother was born on betazed
 according to starfleet records pierce and the other persons counsellor troi identified were killed in an accidental plasma discharge eight years ago their bodies were never found
 i believe she is doing well her appetite has increased by seven percent and she is starting to engage in prenatal behaviour
 i have noticed that many humans prefer not to know in order to experience the surprise during birth i believe i will preserve the mystery until then
 i have spent the past nine weeks as an expectant parent i would be happy to share my insights with your husband if my experience is any indication he will need all the help he can get
 that would be inadvisable sir the asteroid field is unusually dense the enterprise is too large to safely navigate through it
 captain i will need a few minutes to attend to a personal matter
 it is possible that it will take several days for captain picard and me to complete our mission i would prefer to have a human present to supervise the birthing process
 i have noticed that you are the only other member of the crew whom spot seems to like
 she is to you however there have been several injuries to other members of the crew who have attempted to care for her
 a place
 i am not certain spot has escaped from my quarters on several occasions and there are twelve male felines on board i intend to run a full dna analysis on the kittens once they
 on my way sir goodbye spot i believe you are in good hands
 captain the ship is not at the prearranged coordinates
 i do not know i am unable to raise them on any communication channel
 i found it sir two light years away
 the enterprise appears to be adrift i am reading power fluctuations on all decks
 there are life signs however sensor readings are highly distorted i am unable to identify specific lifeforms
 main power is offline all systems are in standby or emergency mode there is no response from any manned station
 i cannot access internal sensors from here we will have to go to the bridge
 yes sir i am able to discern over three hundred different vocalisations
 it is composed of reptilian dna i believe it is an epidermal layer that has been cast off during moulting
 yes sir i cannot explain it there are no species aboard the enterprise that shed their skin in this fashion
 sir
 no sir
 her dna is in a state of ribocyatic flux her genetic codes are being resequenced and her cells are mutating as a result at a fundamental level sir she is no longer human
 her respiratory tissue has become capable of metabolising both water and air and her eyes have developed nictitating membranes i believe she is amphibian sir
 yes sir theres klingon dna in the wound it is saliva
 it would appear so
 i will need to run a full biospectral analysis
 his upper spinal column has been broken in three places
 yes sir
 yes sir however it was in its initial stages when he died captain i am picking up one thousand and eleven individual life forms within the ship all exhibit a similar genetic flux to the one we observed in counsellor troi
 most of the lifeforms are scattered throughout the ship however there are several large concentrations in the arboretum and the aquatic lab
 captain his cranial plates have thickened by twenty percent his brain is much smaller sir i do not believe he can comprehend our language
 yes sir his dna would seem to confirm that observation captain i believe the crew is deevolving
 i have analysed commander rikers dna structure a synthetic tcell has invaded his genetic codes this tcell has begun to activate his latent introns
 they are genetic codes which are normally dormant they are evolutionary holdovers sequences of dna that provided key behavioural and physical characteristics millions of years ago but are no longer necessary for instance counsellor trois gill slits and other amphibious characteristics were derived from introns which still contain amphibious codes
 that is correct in her case the dna has created an amphibious lifeform which became extinct over fifty million years ago
 yes sir i would say australopithecine each of these stages is another link in the evolutionary chain which stretches back to the origins of all lifeforms on earth because introns can include genetic material from many different species over millions of years of evolution it is possible that a wide variety of transformations is occurring among the crew
 all humanoid life has a similar genetic pattern the virus should work on nonhuman crewmembers in the same way they are each deevolving to earlier forms of life on their homeworlds i feel i must inform you sir you have also been infected by the intron virus
 according to my calculations within the next twelve hours you will begin to exhibit the first signs of your eventual transformation
 i believe you will also deevolve into some form of early primate possibly similar to a lemur or a pygmy marmoset
 i am uncertain we will need to run several microcellular scans however the ships main computer has been damaged captain the computer in my quarters has an independent processing and memory storage unit it should not be affected i suggest we start from there
 it would appear that spot has had her kittens
 yes i am curious as to why spot is not caring for them
 no sir
 these kittens were born less than twenty four hours it would appear that spots transformation took place at approximately the same time
 i believe so for some reason the intron virus was not passed on to the kittens i do not know why
 that is true placental barrier maternal antibodies and amniotic fluids all serve as a filtration system
 it would take further research but i believe to be effective on humanoid crewmembers humanoid antibodies would be necessary
 nurse ogawa has recently became pregnant
 i have traced her comm badge signal to deck seventeen section twenty one alpha
 one of the warp plasma vents has failed main engineering has been abandoned there is no one there to fix the problem
 i can repair the damaged plasma vent from here
 i believe it was lieutenant barclay he appeared to be partially transformed into an arachnid
 yes sir are you all right captain
 you may be experiencing the initial stages of your transformation early primates were often prey to larger carnivores as a result their instincts probably included a heightened sense of awareness
 captain i have analysed nurse ogawas embryo it has been unaffected by the virus i believe i can use her amniotic fluid as a template for a retrovirus it would neutralise the synthetic tcell and reestablish the original genetic patterns of each host
 it will not take long to isolate the appropriate genetic material i will need to get the sickbay computer back on
 it is large approximately two hundred kilograms it is heavily armored with an exoskeleton life signs appear to be klingon
 we cannot be certain a stun setting will have any effect on him a higher setting may kill him
 there are crewmembers in the corridors and other sections of the ship it would be much easier for him to capture and consume one of them than to attempt to break through a door
 captain what are you suggesting
 if that is true he must be trying to reach her now
 the mating instinct is quite strong in klingon biology i am not certain what would be an effective lure
 i am extracting a blood sample from one of her sebaceous glands where the pheromones are produced i believe i can activate the pheromones with a bioactivant solution
 i believe this will produce the desired effect i will use it to draw worf to a another part of the ship
 captain that is extremely unwise worf may be much faster than
 computer display progress of genetic resequencing
 computer increase nucleotide substitution by thirty two percent
 data to captain picard
 the retro virus is working sir
 i can release it into the ships atmosphere in a gaseous state
 however it will take some time to take effect
 are you all right sir
 if so we may have to call security
 i was of course not serious about calling security it was a joke
 goodbye wes
 the delay will also make it possible for stellar dynamics to complete their study of the vodrey nebula
 starfleet records contain no mention of the duras sisters after their departure from deep space nine
 we are approaching kalla three
 it is difficult to say the magnesite is interfering with bioreadings
 then you are denying involvement in illegal mining activities
 would you be willing to share your information with us
 we could certainly provide passage off this planet in exchange for information
 gather your belongings it is time to leave
 i am detecting a vessel holding position near the third planet it is a yridian freighter
 the resonance signature indicates that there is magnesite ore present
 sir readings indicate that there are only five hundred kilograms of ore in the yridian hold
 sir that would place the ore directly off the ships starboard bow
 it appears to be an unmanned probe approximately one half metre in diameter there are no identifiable armaments
 the beam appears to contain holographic imaging information
 aye sir
 captain i am unable to find any information on jason vigos current whereabouts
 no sir
 that would significantly narrow our search the only cultivated land is on the southern continent and there are relatively few people engaged in agricultural activities
 i am detecting eight humans three are female however they are all too young to be miranda vigo
 one is an infant another is elderly two are middle aged
 i am having difficulty getting a clear reading on the eighth the individual appears to be approximately two kilometres beneath the planets surface
 male between twenty and thirty years old
 aye sir
 bok took the precaution of encrypting the probes navigational systems so that we would be unable to decipher its flight path
 those phenomena are relatively common we would need to identify at least one of them specifically in order to postulate a flight path
 captain incoming message from daimon birta
 there is a class four pulsar three light years from the nebula my calculations indicate the probe was launched in the xendi kabu system
 captain i have compiled all available records pertaining to jason vigos criminal record and
 yes sir he has been charged three times with petty theft twice for disorderly conduct and several dozen times for trespassing
 i believe the charges relate to his climbing activities in the caves underneath the planets surface this is the information you requested is it not
 i do not believe so sir
 captain i do not believe it was meant as an attack but rather as a message
 yes sir in bzal a ferengi code which uses an alternating pattern of light and darkness
 i am attempting to do so the message reads my revenge is at hand
 bok was in direct contact with this chair for an extended period it is showing a distinctive subspace signature as a result
 the federation abandoned its research in the field because the technology was found to be unreliable as well as energy intensive
 in theory it could operate over several light years
 if bok uses his transporter again we might be able to trace the subspace signature and locate his ship
 it is a possibility
 in order to do so we would need to tie the ships subspace field coils into the transporter system
 sir sensors are detecting a subspace carrier wave headed for the ship its signature is consistent with boks transporter
 the transporter beam is focusing on deck nine section four
 no sir the subspace signature left by his transporter is decaying more rapidly than predicted it may not be possible to trace it
 i am tracing the transporter beam bok used to send the probe the ship is holding position approximately three hundred billion kilometres from here
 it may be possible sir but it would not be advisable
 phase dampers are in synch standing by to modulate the transport pattern
 initiating transport sequence now
 graves at my command have wakd their sleepers opd and let em forth by my so potent art but this rough magic i here abjure and when i have required some heavenly music which even now i do to work mine end upon their senses that this airy charm is for ill break my staff bury it certain fathoms in the earth and deeper than did ever plummet sound ill breaks character captain sir your attention is wandering
 but sir i am supposed to be attempting a neoplatonic magical rite the darkness is appropriate for such a ritual
 perhaps i have been too literal with respect to my set design computer modify holodeck programme data seven three
 yes sir captain i am not certain i fully understand this prospero character i would appreciate any insight you might have that would improve my performance
 there is certainly a tragic aspect to the character
 no sir
 it appears to be a steam locomotive
 if i am not mistaken
 captain you are injured
 the train we encountered was from one of doctor crushers holodeck programs it was a recreation of the orient express a train which travelled from paris to istanbul from the late nineteenth century until
 there appears to have been a malfunction in the holodecks database retrieval programme the two programs somehow temporarily linked together
 it is a possibility i will need to run a diagnostic to be certain
 aye sir
 the ship has moved into warp sir
 apparently no one helm and navigation controls are not functioning our speed is now warp seven point three and holding
 bearing one eight seven mark four i am unable to determine our destination however we are heading away from the mekorda sector
 we are no longer at warp sir impulse power has resumed all systems show normal
 we are approximately thirty billion kilometres from our original position
 one fact is clear however the distortion was growing in strength if we had remained at our original position one point seven seconds longer the distortion would have ruptured our warp core
 perhaps the engines were activated by a random power fluctuation
 it is improbable but it is possible
 there is another possibility
 the sensors apparently detected a dangerous anomaly that threatened the enterprise it is possible that they triggered a safety device which caused the ship to avoid destruction
 it appears to be connected to several other systems as well including the warp control circuits
 i am not certain perhaps it came from the node itself
 it appears to be protecting itself
 these nodes were linking the sensors to our warp control and defensive systems we believe this is why the ship jumped to warp
 it is possible that the magnascopic storm we recently experienced had an unexpected effect on the ships systems
 as they increase it will become progressively more difficult to control the ship
 agreed all of the nodal connections intersect in holodeck three it appears to be a focal point of some kind
 commander the holodeck appears to be in operation
 i did but it has reactivated itself and it will not disengage
 several different programs are running simultaneously
 no sir i estimate that this scene consists of portions of seven distinct holodeck programs
 commander i have located a large concentration of nodes behind this wall they appear to be connected directly to the holodecks main power coupling
 the power grid is located beneath this deck sir
 i believe we have changed direction
 commander according to my tricorder the holodeck safeties have been disengaged his weapon could be lethal
 the number of systems now being affected by the nodes has increased considerably sensors engines replicators propulsion they are all working together now almost independently of the main computer and the nodes link them all through the holodeck
 commander i believe what happens on the holodeck has a direct effect on the ship when we attempted to destroy the nodes the characters on the train responded almost immediately to stop us
 then the conductor then signalled for the train to change directions and at approximately the same time
 not precisely geordi does the configuration of connection nodes look familiar to you
 that is correct it would appear that the nodes are in the process of creating a rudimentary neural net
 unlikely as it may sound i believe that the enterprise may be forming an intelligence
 this is a synaptic map of the human neocortex this is a cross section of my positronic net and this is a schematic of the connection nodes linking the ships systems i believe some sort of neural matrix is forming on the ship it is still relatively primitive but it is an intelligence nonetheless
 i believe it is an emergent property
 complex systems can sometimes behave in ways that are entirely unpredictable the human brain for example might be described in terms of cellular functions and neurochemical interactions but that description does not explain human consciousness a capacity that far exceeds simple neural functions consciousness is an emergent property
 exactly
 the enterprise contains a vast database of information which is managed by a sophisticated computer this complex system gives the ship many of the characteristics of a biological organism
 yes sir i believe a selfdetermining intelligence is emerging
 i believe the key to understanding the ships behaviour lies in the holodeck all of the connection nodes intersect at that location it is clearly some kind of processing centre
 yes sir a focal point where all the ideas and instincts of this emerging intelligence are first expressed in some form
 if you will distract these people i will attempt to depolarise the power grid
 i am ready to access the main power grid
 i can access the power grid here i will attempt to depolarise the grid by using a low frequency inversion field it may disengage the nodes without destroying them
 data here
 i encountered a minor difficulty counsellor but it has been dealt with
 i am ready to depolarise the power grid
 acknowledged
 agreed
 data to captain picard
 there has been an accident on the holodeck sir has anything happened to the enterprise
 data to captain
 the train has returned to normal sir our destination is new vertiform city
 understood sir
 how did the conductor stop the train
 i can get us there more quickly i know a shorter route
 yes if you will let me handle the controls
 data to captain picard i have taken control of the engine room
 i will attempt to do so
 captain i am staging a scene from the tempest this evening for a small audience i would like for you to attend
 mirandas first encounter with other human beings
 it seemed appropriate captain you took a substantial risk in allowing the enterprise to complete its task
 because the end result was unknown the object could have been dangerous it may in fact be dangerous
 yes sir
 i will scan their warp signatures sir sensors indicate the attacking vessels are federation ships
 they are not responding sir
 the maquis ships are regrouping sir they are closing in on the cardassian vessel
 she is responsible for the death of a cardassian soldier
 do you know where she went
 it is unlikely that they would receive our communication sir the topin system contains an unstable protostar it generates significant magnetoscopic interference
 most of our sensors would be ineffective although our directional array should cut through the interference
 no sir it will take approximately six hours to scan this system
 i am attempting to do so
 sir i am scanning the area from which the distress signal was sent but i am unable to detect a vessel
 sir a vessel of some kind is attempting to penetrate our aft shields
 the vessel that penetrated our shields is of the same design as the ships used by the maquis it is moving off
 i have established a relay link with the sensor probe we left on the perimeter of the nebula this is the convoy we are expecting the maquis attack force to cross the border from the demilitarised zone
 sir the maquis squadron is coming into sensor range
 sir the vessel being piloted by lieutenant ro is firing a low intensity particle beam into the nebula
 the polarising effect being created by the beam may make it possible for us to be detected
 i will attempt to do so
 sir the maquis ships are breaking formation
 no sir they are withdrawing
 holding the lucasian chair does have its perquisites this house originally belonged to sir isaac newton when he held the position its become the traditional residence
 jessel she can be frightfully trying at times but she does make me laugh
 i found that a touch of grey adds an air of distinction
 captain how long has it been since youve seen a physician about your irumodic syndrome
 but sir peridaxon
 in all honesty captain the thought has occurred to me however theres nothing to disprove what youre saying so its possible something is happening to you the first thing we should do is run a complete series of neurographic scans we can use the equipment at the biometrics lab here on the campus jessel ask professor ripper to take over my lecture for tomorrow possibly for the rest of the week captain well get to the bottom of this
 that would be inadvisable
 if you attempt to ignite a petroleum product on this ship at zero hundred hours it will activate the fire suppression system which would seal off this entire compartment
 expression of what
 ah then to burn the midnight oil implies late work
 i am curious what is the etymology of that idiom how did it come to be used in contemporary language
 it is good to see you too sir
 certainly
 this will need a completely new field induction subprocessor it appears that we will be required to ignite the midnight petroleum sir
 it would appear there is a discontinuity between the time periods you described events in one time period would seem to have no effect on the other two
 aye sir
 computer restore holographic image
 there is another option we could arrange passage aboard a medical ship
 yes sir there was an outbreak of terrellian plague on romulus the klingons have been allowing federation medical ships to cross the border
 doctor
 im not sure information on the klingon political structure is hard to come by these days however at last report worf was governor of hatoria a small klingon colony near the border
 how would you define unusual sir every region of space has its own unique properties that cannot be found anywhere else
 nothing sir
 given the fact that there is an apparent discontinuity between the three time periods the captain has visited qs statement may be accurate if confusing
 that is true qs interest in you has always been very similar to that of a master and his beloved pet that was only an analogy captain
 captain there are four warbirds holding position on the romulan side of the neutral zone
 sensors are picking up a large subspace anomaly directly ahead
 aye sir
 we are approaching the devron system captain sensors are picking up a large subspace anomaly directly ahead
 aye sir
 as you can see sir theres nothing there
 still nothing captain ive conducted a full sensor sweep out to one light year from the pasteur no temporal anomalies no particle fluctuations nothing
 there are several methods of detecting temporal disturbances but were limited by the equipment on the pasteur
 however it may be possible to modify the main deflector to emit an inverse tachyon pulse which could scan beyond the subspace barrier
 to make the modifications and search the entire devron system will take approximately fourteen hours
 the anomaly is two hundred million kilometres in diameter it is a highly focused temporal energy source which is emitting approximately the same energy output as ten g type stars
 i am uncertain sir sensors are unable to penetrate the anomaly
 that is a most intriguing idea sir i do not believe a tachyon beam was ever used in such a way i had no idea you were so versed in the intricacies of temporal theory sir
 i believe we can make the necessary modifications in main engineering sir
 agreed initiating tachyon pulse
 it will take the computer some time to give us a complete picture of the anomalys interior i suggest we
 geordi what is wrong
 data to sickbay medical emergency in main engineering
 captain i believe i have a partial explanation i have completed my analysis of the anomaly it appears to be a multiphasic temporal convergence in the spacetime continuum
 it is in essence an eruption of antitime
 a relatively new concept in temporal mechanics the relationship between antitime and normal time is analogous to the relationship between antimatter and normal matter
 they would annihilate one other causing a rupture in space i believe this is what happened in the devron system the rupture may be sending out waves of temporal energy which are disrupting the normal flow of time
 antitime sir
 that is a fascinating hypothesis how did you formulate
 captain another ship decloaking bearing two one five mark three one oh its the enterprise
 theyre hailing us
 the klingon ship is disengaging admiral riker is hailing us
 approximately one hour forty five minutes sir
 aye sir
 our tachyon pulse has been unable to completely penetrate the anomaly if we had information on the centre of the phenomenon we might have a basis for speculation
 in theory a tomographic imaging scanner capable of multiphasic resolution would be able to penetrate this much interference the daystrom institute has been working on such a device but it is still only theoretical
 yes sir
 possibly taps the console there is a great deal of interference but i am getting some readings this is very unusual
 it appears that our tachyon pulse is converging with two other tachyon pulses at the centre of the anomaly the other two pulses have the exact same amplitude modulation as our own pulse it is as if all three originated from the enterprise
 captain what are you suggesting
 i suspect the last thing counsellor troi would have wanted is for the two of you to be alienated
 i think i know what the captains talking about if im not mistaken hes describing a paradox
 intriguing it is possible we couldve caused the very anomaly weve been looking for let us assume for a moment that the captain has been travelling through time let us also assume he has initiated an tachyon pulse at the same coordinates in space in all three time periods in that case it is possible that the convergence of three tachyon pulses couldve ruptured the subspace barrier and created an antitime reaction
 if we go back to the devron system now we might be able to see the initial formation of the anomaly
 sensors are picking up a small temporal anomaly off the port bow
 the anomaly is being sustained by the continuing tachyon pulses in the other two time periods i suggest shutting them down
 i will investigate the options
 sir
 aye sir
 no sir
 aye sir disengaging
 it remains unaffected here as well sir
 it would require taking the ship into the anomaly itself once inside we may be able to use the engines to create a static warp shell
 collapsing the anomaly and restoring the normal flow of time but this would have to be done in the other two time periods as well
 i am preparing to initiate a static warp shell
 captain i have an idea if we take the ship to the centre of the anomaly and create a static warp shell
 yes sir
 at least thirty seconds sir
 we have reached the centre sir
 initiating static warp shell now
 something is happening a new subspace barrier appears to be forming
 captain it appears to be working the anomaly is beginning to collapse i think that
 the warp shell is definitely having an effect sir the anomaly is collapsing
 both of the other ships have been destroyed
 the anomaly is nearly collapsed
 i believe however this situation is unique since the anomaly did not occur there have already been changes in the way this time line is unfolding the future we experience will undoubtedly be different from the one the captain encountered
 five card draw deuces wild
 would you care to deal sir
